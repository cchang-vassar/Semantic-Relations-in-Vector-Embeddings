"daniel_81_physical-education_con_opening_james","81","CON","daniel","james","Physical education should not be mandatory, and obviously physical education, the reason why physical education shouldn't be mandatory isn't because exercise is bad, obviously exercise is a good thing.

If anything, people clearly don't do it enough in the status quo, and I think that one of the big culprits for this is because of the way in which you give people a false sense of actually working out, even though it's oftentimes happening grossly ineffectively, and in the worst way possible.

So, first, why do I think PE class is one of the absolute worst ways in which you absolute eh at which you can get a workout?

First, because it's a like a pretty short amount of time, like maybe the class will be like fifty minutes long usually, you take maybe like your ten to fifteen minutes to change into your gym clothes anyway, they do attendance for another five minutes, than you do like you like mess around for another ten minutes probably.

Like at the end of the day, you're not really doing all that much.

Additionally, PE oftentimes isn't all that enjoyable for people, and it's not that enjoyable for people, because different people like to exercise in different ways.

Some people may want to play soccer, some people may want to just run, other people may want to like play basketball, other people may want to play like four square, or play field like like, there's endless ways in which people can like like be active physically.

And PE, as like a mandatory PE class, it necessarily requires it to either a, be structured and like boring and unified, which is going to make a lot of people think that working out is this boring thing that they don't enjoy, or b, it's just going to lead to like this decentralized chaos, where people can just kind of like use the time to talk to friends while like walking around on a track outside, which isn't actually helping anyone.

Additionally, like the final reason, why PE class is like the worst time to get a work out, is because like nobody wants to have this exercise in the middle of the day, like nobody wants to actually try that hard, because like it's is not fun to sit in class gross and sweaty for the rest of the day, after you go to the gym.

That's not enjoyable, nobody wants to like smell or feel sweaty all day, like you just don't feel good when you're in your class you don't want to put in that effort.

But additionally like, when you're in school, you're focusing on other things, are focusing on your grades and your academics and the like, and you're preoccupied, you're not really thinking about like yeah flex, things like that .

So, that's not important, like you should leave it a like like recess is a good enough time to get this break.

And secondarily like, the second reason why PE therefore shouldn't be mandatory is like, all this comes in conjunction with in assumption that PE, which is bad as I just talked about, this is a suitable replacement for actually working out, which is bad.

And the reason for that, is because like if like if you spend like your time in PE class today, like you like did a little bit of physical activity, in your mind, especially after like a long and tiring day at school, when you already feel gross and sweaty, because you worked out, you are probably not going to feel like you need to work out more, you're probably not going to exercise more on your own, or play like a game after school with your friends, like a sport, you might be less likely to do these things, because you feel tired and stressed out, but also because you feel like you're already working out, you're already doing enough work out, and clearly that's not true.

It creates this like illusion of solvency for a problem, and it means that you're less likely to actually more effectively work out.

So for all those reasons, PE should not be mandatory.

"
"james_81_physical-education_con_opening_will","81","CON","james","will","Physical education should not be mandatory.

So we're going to explain to you why primary and secondary school students ought not be required to participate in gym or other physical education activities.

We're obviously fine with letting people opt into it or with having optional after school sports, but we don't think this should be compulsory.

Our first argument is about when the state should intervene to make something compulsory.

And this is what we heard from the last speaker about as well.

We're going to propose a slightly different standard though.

We think that the state should do something for people when there is an imbalance in power or information that the state needs to correct, or when there are harms to third parties and I'll explain in a minute why I don't think that the objective good is a proper standard.

So why is there no information asymmetry in this instance?

We think first of all that children know, broadly speaking, that exercise is good for them even from a very young age.

What's more, they know that sport is an important part of their lives and if they want to participate in sport.

But even if you think that children can't make these decisions for themselves or maybe that you know fifteen year olds can decide this but eight year olds can't, which might be fair, we allow children's parents to correct for these imbalances in information all the time.

Certainly, every parent knows that exercise and sports are an important part of children's upbringing so we think that we should defer to letting parents make this decision rather than schools.

After all every child has different needs and we think that parents ultimately know these better than the state.

At the point where we let parents make decisions like whether or not their children are going to work during high school or how to name them or what religion to have them practice, we think that we can also trust them to decide if their kids ought to play football or not.

In terms of third party harms, I just don't think that there are any harms to other groups because one set of individuals doesn't choose to exercise during primary school.

At the end of the day this is a personal choice and we think that it ought be left to individuals.

So there's no reason for the government to get involved.

Now, will talk about a third standard that I want to deal with real quick.

He told you that an objective good is a proper standard for state intervention, but I'll show you why this is absurd.

It would be an objective good if everybody ran three miles every day and if we all put a very high premium on physical fitness.

But the government doesn't tell thirty seven year olds that they have to go and run a five k everyday, so why should we tell sixteen year olds that they have to do so?

Now it's true that we treat children differently from adults in some respects but if you think that the absolute good is sufficient reason for the government to abrogate personal freedom, then you should apply it to everyone and make everybody go out and play a game of soccer every saturday and run three miles every day.

Since it's clear that we wouldn't do that, I don't see why this should apply to children as well I don't think that's a good standard for state intervention.

Our second and final point is about the purpose of education.

Because let's remember we don't take all these kids away from their families and send them off to school for ten hours a day for fun.

We do it because we need to train them as citizens and workers.

This is why we train them in liberal arts skills, things like history and english so they can be better citizens, and practical skills such as technical skills or computer skills so that they can go on to get good jobs.

Now I don't see how physical education directly contributes to this.

It's true that people will be healthier in the long run if they do more physical education, but it doesn't directly make them a better citizen.

There are many people who are not physically fit who still vote and participate in public life.

And it doesn't make them a better worker either.

In the same way we see that many overweight people or disabled people are able to be good workers.

So I just don't think that this fulfills the purposes that society sets for education and therefore it has no place in our schools.

For all these reasons physical education should not be mandatory.

Thank you.

"
"james_81_physical-education_pro_opening","81","PRO","james","","Physical education should be mandatory.

So, by physical education we mean things like gym classes in primary and secondary school.

So, with this in mind, we have three arguments for why this should be the case.

The first is about the good of the child.

We think that education in general is conducted for the benefit of young people.

It's probably the case that most ten year olds don't want to be studying arithmetic or shakespeare, but we make them do it anyway, because we recognize that it's for their own good.

There's an ancient philosophical maxim, sound mind in a sound body.

We think that it's not enough to fill children's head with knowledge and civic skills.

We think that we also need to provide them with the ability to have good health in the future, and also to be useful citizens.

In terms of health, it's obviously going to be to the benefit of children to provide them with a healthier body so that they will be better off into old age.

If people are physically fit as young people, it's much more likely that they'll be physically fit as they grow older.

And we see that for instance, who exercised more when they're younger, are less at risk of debilitating diseases like obesity and diabetes.

So ultimately it's in these children's interest that we put them through physical education.

But we think that another important part of physical education is sport.

And that by playing sports, young people learn important skills such as teamwork and how to accomplish a common goal.

Or even if they play individual sports, they still learn the value of discipline, and hard work in a way that they wouldn't necessarily learn in the classroom.

So we see that it's clearly in the good of individual children to require physical education.

And for that reason, the state should make it mandatory, so that all of them have equal access.

Because, when something is required, ultimately everyone has access to that thing.

Our second argument is about why there's a compelling state interest in physical education.

So, recognize that in countries with conscription like the republic of china or israel, the ability of the state to have useful conscripts is dependent on the physical fitness of people graduating from school every year.

If you have lots and lots of eighteen year olds who are graduating from secondary education and they can't run a mile in eight minutes, much less run a mile in six minutes carrying a bunch of equipment, then we think that at the end of the day they're not going to be particularly useful in a military operation.

What that means is that much of their time in conscription it's going to be wasted on physical conditioning, when that could have all been done while they were in school.

But on top of that, citizens who are healthier are less likely to have health problems in the future.

Which means that the burden on the state health care regimes such as national health in britain or medicare and medicaid in the united states, is going to be lower because people will have fewer health problems overall both in youth and in old age.

We think that because of this clear financial interest, the state should intervene to encourage people to be healthy at a younger age.

Our third and final point is that we think that people will be better employees if they go through this physical education.

Many jobs, particularly for people who don't go on to higher education, require some base level of physical fitness.

It's true that you don't have to be arnold schwarzenegger to work stock at a clothing store, but you do have to be able to lift a 50 pound box overr your head, which is something that unfortunately many young people don't have the physical fitness to do right now because they don't go through this physical training in school.

So we see that people are missing out on employment opportunities.

And many better jobs such as manufacturing et cetera, require a basic level of physical conditioning.

The only way to guarantee that everyone has that level of physical conditioning is through physical education in schools.

So at the end of the day, we see that young people will be more valuable to employers, which ultimately will lead to economic growth, and also allow them to provide a better lives for themselves and their families as a result of this.

So because it's to the benefit of every child and it's part of their education, because the government has a clear interest in having useful soldiers and healthy citizens, and because it makes these people better employees, we think that physical education should be mandatory.

Thank you.

"
"will_81_physical-education_pro_opening","81","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that physical education should be mandatory.

First, just a quick overview on how, you know, the burden structure in this round works.

Because generally speaking, when we're talking about whether or not a government should compel action by individuals, there's a couple standards that independently can be sufficient to justify that requirement.

So, what I mean by this is that obviously the opp line in this round is going to be something to the effect of, "" well, you know, you're telling these kids that they got to do a thing, and it's better when you allow them to make the choice, "" because individuals are more capable of making choices for themselves that some third-party actor.

That's obviously a high standard that we hold in pretty high regard.

So generally speaking then, we have high bars that we meet to ensure that, you know, that's not that the that the restriction is justified.

I see two, and these are going to be my two independent points.

The first is if there is more or less objective good given to the individual when you enact a restriction, so for example, restrictions that we put on cigarettes, for example, are more or less objective and this is why we are justified in doing them, also why we, you know, require academic education in beyond just physical education.

But secondly is when there's externalities.

That is, you know, also looking at cigarettes, something like secondhand smoke, something where we see that a person that didn't consent into the action is suffering consequences and as a result we are justified in restricting it because, you know, your autonomy doesn't extend to violating other people's preferences.

On the first point, then, regarding objectivity, I think there's a pretty obvious case to be made in terms of, you know, the health benefits of engaging in physical education.

Especially when children are quite young, there is a serious need to ensure that they are physically active.

This country's obesity epidemic really underlines how insufficient a job we are of doing meeting that standard but, you know, just that small amount of physical activity a day, you know, thirty minutes or whatever, that really goes a long way in ensuring the child's long-term physical well-being.

Without that physical education, there really isn't an meaningful check to ensure that they are doing that.

I think a lot of the kids that are getting their proper exercise are the type of kids that are usually fine with doing PE anyway.

These are the more competitive kids, the more active ones.

I think really what PE is designed to do is to target the kids that aren't getting a sufficient amount of exercise on a daily basis, because they're just not the type of the personality type that enjoys doing that on a regular basis.

But it is still important to ensure that they get that physical education, so the government probably is then justified in mandating it.

On the second standard then, regarding externalities, I think a lot of this folds into healthcare costs.

So, this was also flouted a lot during the sugary drinks debate around new york city.

And what happens here is that when you have a substantial amount of people that are, you know, not active enough and by extension, then, not healthy, their healthcare costs go up.

This is, you know, fairly clear why this would happen, you know, that they're more likely to have physical illnesses, they're going to be making more doctors visits, so on so forth.

Given that, the the way the healthcare works essentially is based on a pool.

That is, when one person's costs go up, in order for them to be properly covered, other people's costs also have to go up.

On an individual level, this really doesn't make that big of a difference.

On a larger societal level, when we are undergoing something like an obesity epidemic, that has a really significant impact on healthcare costs.

And, in fact, the united states now is one of the most expensive places to get healthcare in the world, and a large factor in that is just the general unhealthiness of this country.

I think that it is justified to engage in tactics there's explicitly designed to improve the healthiness of individuals within this country when there are broader externalities on other people, people that have to pay more for health care because of other people's , you know, health.

Given that, proud to propose.

"
"will_121_ban-boxing_con_opening_james","121","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition of today's motion that boxing has to be baned.

So first with regards to the model, I think it's important to recognize that it is within ops ground to say this is a thing that can be regulated.

This is a thing that we can actually take proactive steps to make safer because that's the trajectory of history.

Sports overtime have become safer.

Things like football, for example, where you have to wear helmets now and that didn't used to be the case awhile ago.

The like trajectory of history means that these things are going to become safer in the long term.

So I think you can like ignore a decent amount of government's arguments on face value as a result of that because the trajectory of history means that the harms that they talk about are more likely than not going to disappear in the long term but absent that, there's three independent points that I'd like to announce today.

First that this provides an opportunity for wealth and a positive mindset or or optimistic mindset for minorities and other historically disadvantaged people who are able to take this as an opportunity to achieve some form of wealth.

Secondly, that the violence is demanded at its zero sum level and as a result of this it is unlikely that abolishing boxing is actually going to meaningfully solve for the societal harm that they talk about, and thirdly, that there is just a non-zero pleasure from viewing that exists as a result of this that is worth voting on.

So with regards to the first argument that this provides a path to riches they tell you ons side government that this is not a thing really that like pans out most of the time for people who participate in boxing that it is a misleading claim that people are brought down this path.

So I think two things on that.

First, with regards to individuals, there is just benefits when you are a mike tyson that actually does get rich on this.

This is something that makes your life better.

Mike tyson used to be very poor, very destitute, having a low quality of life.

Now he has a high quality of life.

So on that individual level those people are a benefit that exists from the sport.

Those are people who were given opportunities that they didn't previously have.

But secondly, I think even if this is misleading for the large majority of people that optimistic mindset that is generated by having this new opportunity that's something that's beneficial to them right?

It means that your outlook on the world is less pessimistic.

It means that even though most people of color and most children of color are more likely going to succumb to the absolute horrors of a racist classes society, it is worth having that optimism just on a psychological level.

It means that the individual is able to have a higher quality of life because they're not constantly being weighed down by the specter of they're, more likely than not, mistreatment by society.

Second independent argument is the demand for violence is zero sum.

This is intuitive I think.

This is just this animalistic saying that is sort of a holdover from evolution and as a result like this is the reason why we enjoy boxing right?

I don't think that goes away when you abolish boxing as an institution.

That demand either a just transfer to other sports like football or MMA or whenever, in which case their arguments are literally non-unique.

Like there's no benefits that exist on side government.

Or even worse, that violence transfers into like actual day-to-day violence where people have harmful interactions on the streets and things like that.

I think that's important to recognize then because that's an actual increase in the harm that exists to the individual people and that's something that's seriously worth being concerned about.

My third independent point is the pleasure that people get from viewing this.

Now I think it's important to recognize that this is a serious impact right?

Like a just on scope lots of people view boxing because they enjoy it.

So I think on a day to day basis those individuals have a lower quality of life because this thing that they hold dear and they really really enjoy whether it's something they enter a for, you know, animalistic like reasons for just because it is a form of escapism or something like that.

That is still a thing that matters to them and creates pleasure within the world.

So if you analyze this through like a utilitarian framework you you just care about how much the individual benefits from the existence of an institution, then this is the thing that makes the world a slightly better place.

But secondly, when you recognize that they really don't have offense because they don't solve for systemic violence, that's just a thing to vote off of because it's the only real benefit of the round.

Given these reasons, I think it's really intuitive as to why the track of history means that a their benefits aren't going to materialize, but secondly, that there are actual tangible harms to engaging in this.

As a result of the fact that people do actually benefit from this, that there are individual level benefits that exists from boxing and abolishing it doesn't really solve for the problems, proud to oppose.

"
"james_121_ban-boxing_con_opening_rachel","121","CON","james","rachel","We should not ban boxing.

We're going to provide you with three arguments for why we don't think boxing should be banned.

We think that boxing should continue to be allowed and encouraged in countries like the US, britain, and other highly developed liberal democratic countries, and also that boxing should remain an olympic sport and otherwise participated in internationally.

We're okay with regulating boxing, such as preventing young men from participating before a certain age or requiring certain safety regulations, but we think it would be a mistake to ban the sport in its entirety, which is what the other side needs to prove to you in this debate: that it should be banned categorically, not merely regulated to be safer.

Our first argument is that we should respect the choices that athletes make.

The other side tries to tell you that people can't internalize the risk of boxing, but I don't think that you have to be a great scholar to understand that a sport where you try to achieve knockouts is potentially dangerous.

If anything, I would say that boxers are probably much more pragmatic than athletes from other sports about how they can be safe with things like concussions and how they can take care of themselves.

We see that, for instance, in kickboxing, which may be a different sport depending on your interpretation or may be interpreted or included in this motion but either way, that they wear headgear.

We see that boxers don't box bare knuckles in the olympics.

Ultimately, there are steps being taken to ensure safety.

And what's more, we tell you that athletes have coaches.

If you think about the relationship between boxers and their coaches, you have an older person mentoring a younger person, who is well aware of the risk that's being posed and can explain it and interpret it for them.

So we think that people can make this decision for themselves.

But also, how is this different than letting people choose to participate in other dangerous sports?

In american football, many athletes have career-ending concussions and suffer from long-term brain damage.

Yet no american would propose seriously that we get rid of the sport.

How is boxing any different?

It may be slightly more dangerous but at that point, it just seems like a matter of punishing one sport arbitrarily while allowing other sports to go on.

In her past speech, rachel criticized boxing because she felt that people would retire from the sport and not have a good career afterwards, but this is a problem for soccer players and basketball players as well.

Many of them retire or aren't able to play professionally and have to find another career.

We just don't think this is a problem that's worth banning boxing.

It's a problem that's more endemic to sport.

Our second argument is that boxing provides a structured and stylized way for people to express violence.

Violence is a part of human culture.

People experience some sort of cathartic reaction to seeing violence in media or entertainment.

There's a reason why people like watching "" saving private ryan "", even though it has that very violent introduction sequence to the movie.

In the same way, people like watching boxing.

Violence may not be part of their own life, but they have some sort of desire to engage with violence, and boxing is a safe way to do so, and ultimately preferable to other violent sports we tell you, where people are more likely to be seriously injured or that are less regulated.

So we think that boxing has an important role in our society as a way for people to express themselves through violence in an ultimately constructive and regulated way rather than lashing out otherwise.

Not every boxer is floyd mayweather.

We don't think that boxing makes people horrible human beings.

We think that if anything, it provides an outlet for some people to express violence who might otherwise express it in a more negative way.

And lastly, we would argue that banning boxing would do a disservice to cultures where it's uniquely important.

If you think about filipinos, many filipinos greatly love boxing and it's a very popular sport there.

Manny pacquiao obviously is a filipino national hero.

So we think that ultimately the harms of this would fall disproportionately on certain cultures that value boxing more highly and that this is unfair to those groups.

For all these reasons, we should not ban boxing.

Thank you.

"
"james_121_ban-boxing_pro_opening","121","PRO","james","","We should ban boxing.

So, what we mean by this is that we think that countries which have strong regulatory agencies for sport ought to ban boxing.

Nothing tricky about what boxing is, you know it's what mike tyson and all these people have done.

So, three main arguments for you: the first is about why we think the government needs to intervene.

We think that the state should ban a certain behavior when there is a lack of information available for one group participating in that behavior.

So, in this instance we think that boxers lack information about boxing that would allow them to make intelligent decisions.

Realize that the companies that promote boxing make a great deal of money off of people being willing to participate in this activity.

What that means that you have lots of businessmen who are interested in convincing young people that it's perfectly safe to box, that there's absolutely no risk to their long term health and that they'll make lots of money and get famous by choosing to do this.

None of which is really true.

There are tremendous risks from concussions, as we've seen with not only boxers but also other athletes, that have a long term health implications, and in addition most people never go on to become successful boxers.

We think that at the end of the day, the health risks greatly outweigh the vast wealth that someone like mike tyson might be able to accrue because of boxing.

So we think the state should intervene to protect the boxers who lack access to good information about boxing.

The second argument that we're going to advance in this debate is about why we think that boxing promotes violence.

So, it seems pretty intuitive that a violent sport would encourage young people to view violence more positively than they would otherwise.

Realize that when young people grow up lionizing boxers, they're lionizing people who hit each other to solve their problems in effect.

We think that at the point where we wouldn't accept school children hitting each other or behaving in this fashion we shouldn't encourage it on the public stage either.

Lionizing an activity normalizes the behavior in society.

It's not just that, you know, impressionable children are going to fight more if they look up to mike tyson, it's also that a culture which features boxing as a sport that's widely admired is more likely to admire violence writ large.

We think that for instance the lionization of soldiers, the lionization of police and of violence in general is much more likely in a society that celebrates violent sport.

We would prefer a world in which violence was seen as an unfortunate necessity when it does have to occur, rather than something which is to be celebrated and glorified, and we think that boxing is incompatible with that view of the world.

But certainly, a world like that would have less violence, fewer people suffering from violence than the world that we live in today.

The last argument that we're going to advance for you in this debate is that we think boxing is harmful for sporting culture.

Recognize that boxing, which promotes these very high stakes fights between two people, I think that the fight between floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao was one of the most expensive paper view events of all time.

Boxing encourages sporting culture to focus on one major event rather than on achievement over time.

We think that people are less likely to look at careers of excellence in other sport as something to celebrate as a result of boxing's prominence, because they're more likely to focus on one match, or in this case one fight.

But on top of that we think that because boxing is such a friendly sport to gambling and betting, that it introduces more gambling and that because boxers are notorious for throwing fights in order to win money, that this introduces more corruption into the sporting world in general.

We would prefer that people focus on team sports, which promote good values as opposed to boxing, and in addition we would prefer that they focus on sports with less gambling and which are less prone to corruption.

So at the end of the day we should ban boxing because of this lack of information for boxers, because it promotes violence and because it harm sporting culture.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_121_ban-boxing_pro_opening","121","PRO","rachel","","The motion for this debate is that we should ban boxing.

Two main areas of clash: the first on the danger to competitors.

We think that you need to paternalize boxers from being able to participate in this and like children who are thinking of being boxers from participating in this activity because society glamorize athletics and physical strength and oftentimes especially for boys glamorizes the associated violence and the associated domination that occurs during boxing.

So at the point that we don't think that people can resist the societal impulses on their own, we think it is necessary for the government to step in and say look this is too dangerous here are the reasons why we are not allowing it anymore.

So first into this is that athletes have a very short shelf life.

So after about ten years their bodies begin to give out but because they've dedicated so much of their lives to this activity there really isn't anything else for them to do.

So what happens is that you basically have someone who spent a solid twenty years of their lives training for this activity, becoming a professional boxer, spent six years in the boxing ring, and then after that has no more marketable skills because physically they can't do anything but also all the time that they spent training in the gym was time they didn't spend learning a different marketable skill.

This means that you actually end up with people who used to be athletes who end up below the poverty line afterwards because they never actually had a real living that they made besides being an athlete.

More than this though we think that physically boxing is incredibly dangerous.

It's the only sport that really involves a accepted and endorsed physical contact through fists.

Recognize that in every other sport such as soccer or basketball there are fouls for elbowing your opponents.

A boxing gets rid of all of that and says go for it.

So you end up with way more broken noses, limbs, necks, and it's also the only sport with a significant death count based on one on impact blow.

So something like thirty people a year die based on one punch in the boxing ring and many more than that die in the boxing ring holistically from more than one punch.

Specifically the use of boxing gloves worsens the situation because the large surface area carries the same initial force as if I was to just punch something but becomes more harmful because of the surface area it covers.

So it literally jiggles the brain by making contacts with more points on your head.

We think that at the point that participants end up with long term physical and mental health problems, that they could not have accounted for, that last far beyond their boxing careers, and end up costing much more than their boxing careers ever afforded them, and they shorten these people's lifespan, it is then okay for us to paternalize them.

But our secondary of clash has to do with why it's bad for society.

We want to talk about why it propagates violent culture.

Because when you watch violence you're essentially normalizing what like what you are looking at, right?

So if every day I spend my time watching people beat each other up I get less surprised the next time it occurs in front of me because it has become so expected.

So in the bobo doll experiment run by skinner, what he did was put put children in a room with a TV where they watched a man beat up a doll and later they were much more likely to mimic this behavior.

We think the same thing occurs when you're watching violent sports such as boxing because when you are a child who's looking at a role models and you're sitting down and you're seeing these big strong men who you aspire to be beating each other up, you're much more likely to go back and mimic this behavior later.

We think that there's an additional layer of harm though, at the point that it turns this activity into entertainment.

In order to maintain people feeling serious about violence, you need to keep a serious aura around it.

So if you make violence into entertainment, you're more likely to end up in situations where people find violence comical and are not actually going to act against it.

And we think that that boxing is specifically unique in this because it doesn't have a second layer to the sport.

There isn't a second goal where you're supposed to kick the ball in, it is completely based on just beating other people up.

For these reasons proud to oppose.

Propose.

"
"daniel_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_yaar","221","CON","daniel","yaar","We absolutely should not ban gambling because it won't work first of all, and secondarily, there's nothing really wrong with gambling.

It should be fine, it should be legal if people want to do it.

So, let's start by talking about why banning gambling will not work at all.

So, the point of banning something, presumably, is you want to deter people from doing it because you think it has some kind of harm or problem.

So, this has an assumption and the assumption is that the ban itself is actually going to deter people from the activity in the first place, that is gambling.

So, that's not going to happen, and it's not going to happen because people have been gambling for thousands of years, people rather enjoy gambling, it's a pretty ingrained part of our culture, we have entire cities dedicated to it, you know, like there's gambling in las vegas obviously, I'm pretty sure there's a lot of gambling in places like eilat in israel as well, there's all kinds of like a lot of cities have these as their industries and things like that.

So there's problems with this.

So, first and foremost a problem is that you're going to see a whole whole lot of resistance from the people who are involved in the gambling industry, a whole lot of resistance about the cities and livelihoods that are being destroyed, and a whole lot of resistance to all of these kinds of policies and bans in the first place.

But second and more importantly, it's completely unenforceable because you can just gamble on the internet, in there's nothing really the government can do to regulate it, because oftentimes the websites can be set up in like different countries or you can even if like the websites are under like any kind of certain set of laws, you're there's always ways that you can use the internet to avoid government detection, and I highly doubt that the government is going to dedicate like legit military and hacking and all kinds of technical and physical and monetary resources to really cracking down gambling, and if it wanted to do that, it would cost like billions if not probably like like so much so many billions of dollars, that it would be a complete waste of time since people are largely going to do it on the internet anyway.

And that's obviously a problem because first and foremost, you're not making the money off of gambling anymore, you can't tax gambling, you can't profit off of it, so a lot of money in revenue is going away.

Additionally when you ban something then it becomes a part of a black market, it's more likely to be unsafe, you're more likely going to have like crime lords and people like that presiding over the factors.

And additionally you also can't have things like consumer protection laws in place, so you can't really enforce things to make sure that like, obviously gambling is random and to a large extent and things like that, but enforcement to make sure that like you aren't being as a gambler like completely screwed over by the people like the house per se, so that's important as well.

So gambling is probably going to happen anyway, might as well happen safer, more profitably, and more effectively if you just regulate it rather than ban it.

But I also think that there's nothing wrong with gambling and it's rather immoral to ban it in the first place, because keep in mind that when people are gambling they're usually gambling with their own money, if they're gambling with someone else's money we call them wall street bankers, so they're usually gambling with their own money not other people's, so that's money that you've earned, that's money that you can do what you want with, you should have the right to spend your money in the way you want, because you work for it.

But additionally, gambling doesn't harm anyone, it's not like gambling doesn't really harm people, like any kind of vague things like crime or whatever like maybe vaguely associated with gambling is problematic, that's usually only because the other things like drugs or prostitution or whatever are illegal in the first place, maybe that should be illegal too, but also, keep in mind that like the black market argument that I made about how that's not going to be solved anyway, so other than maybe like the vague facilitation of crime, there's no real reason why gambling itself is all that bad, why you shouldn't be able to spend your money that you earned that way if you want.

So for those reasons, we should not ban gambling.

"
"rachel_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_daniel","221","CON","rachel","daniel","Op agrees that gambling is generally a bad thing that ought be discouraged in society.

But there is a difference between discouraging it and banning it.

And we think that even though it is justified to discourage things that are bad for society, it is not justified to ban it unless they can show a distinct third party harm that is worthy of compromising one's rights on.

We don't think government did it, but here are some examples of regulations.

We think that maybe the government should first stop propping gambling up.

And also you can even explain the risks much in the same way that even though smoking is damaging to myself and third parties and secondhand smoke can be damaging to others, the government cannot ban me from inhaling tobacco smoke.

Rather they can put a sticker on every package that tells me, don't do this, in the same way we think that op would be accepting of regulations imposed against gambling that requires the disclosure of the risks or warning labels to be all over the place.

But banning is what government had to prove.

With that, two main areas of clash: the first on why we think this is a legitimate action within the market that cannot be banned.

We think that most businesses are, in part, ripping off the consumer to make money.

Even something as innocuous as insurance operates on the person's fear or risk of injury to make them overpay so that afterwards they might pay a little bit less for some operation and is widely considered not worth it given that any given individual's risk for developing an injury is low.

But we do it and we allow insurance corporations to exist regardless of the fact that they are ripping off the consumer because it is okay for them to make money off ripping off the consumer as long as the consumer's freely choosing to pay into that system.

We think that in a capitalist economy we let business businesses make money in this way and pop up where the desire comes from and even if they if they're making money off of others poor choices, as long as those people are not being able being coerced into that system by like any like massive harm or threat, than that system is allowed to exist.

Otherwise it is an unfair imposition of the government into the market and cannot occur.

Our secondary of clash has to do as to why this is a legitimate choice of the person and the government cannot interfere with that right.

Because we think that in the end, people have a right to make bad decisions.

Even if I think that there are better ways to spend money than buying than gambling or a comparable example might be buying things in online games, this is what my opinion is and I don't get to impose this opinion on other people, because in the end I do not know their life, I do not know what they can afford, or what they think is more important to them.

Some people do prioritize being able to gamble or pay into games more than they prioritize their own health.

Is this a problem?

Yes, but it's also their problem and not one that the government gets to interfere in, much in the way that it is their decision if they want to smoke cigarettes, and not the right of the government to say, I'm sorry but you can't.

We think that in the end the interfering into these kinds of rights can be incredibly harmful, because at the point that the government can just decide, because there are better alternatives, we are going to ban this one, there's nothing standing between a democratic government and just dictating everything that your citizens must do.

Yes, there is a certain exercise regime that is much better than what you're currently doing, we're going to ban not exercising.

These are the examples of what comes along when you start imposing on people's rights.

We think in the end, people will always make bad decisions and the government cannot regulate them all away.

What this means is that sometimes you're just going to have to stand there and watch.

In the end, that person knows themselves better than a large bureaucratic body that has never met them ever will.

And even though gambling is damaging to some, it is certainly not damaging to all, and certainly not damaging enough that it ought be banned.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_221_ban-gambling_pro_opening","221","PRO","yaar","","We should ban gambling.

We believe that true liberty means independence.

It's having control over the basic course of your life.

To have this control stripped from you, is to be robbed of your liberty, and we mustn't let that happen.

Surely, almost every decision in life can have unpredictable outcome, so let's be crystal clear: we're in favor of banning every activity, in which you gamble purely on conditions that you have no control or knowledge over.

This means no more roulettes, or slot machines, and with regard to card games, such as poker, this is arguably something that you can control by having some skill, so we're going to leave that question open.

We don't think that it harms in any way the principle that we defend in this debate.

So, obviously were also talking strictly about activities where significant sums of money are involved.

So, we're going to have two arguments in this speech: one, on when are we allowed to protect you from yourself, and second, on some practical effects of banning gambling.

First argument: like with any other thing we're banning, this is restricting people from doing certain things that they might want to do.

If they're not harming anyone else, why is it okay for us to intervene?

The answer here is that gambling is highly addictive, as the huge number of compulsive gamblers can attest to.

And because it is by definition something that you have no control over, at the point in which you get addicted, you can easily reach a stage where you lose all control over your life, therefore in this case, much like all sorts of very addictive narcotics, it is permissible to intervene and the only way to do that is to try and cut it at its root, because once you're in it, it's probably too late.

What's more, it's usually the weakest, most poorest, that find themselves addicted to gambling.

Why?

Because where wealthy gamblers see casinos as a fun, amusing, outdoor activity, for the less well off it's often considered their rescue wheel, their ticket out of poverty, and so they end up spending much more, and getting sucked in due to this, unfortunately, false hope.

These people are sometimes not educated enough, or otherwise just too enchanted by the thought of suddenly becoming rich, that they're unable to fully realize how scarce their chances of success really are.

These are the people that casinos are targeting, because they know they'll be able to squeeze a lot of money out out of them.

So essentially, we say that this is a lot like fraud, or false advertising, and this is all the more reason to protect our citizens, even at the expense of forbidding then something they might want to do.

And of course, it's not only the gamblers themselves that end up getting hurt, but also their families, seeing as many compulsive gamblers end up mortgaging their properties, or otherwise grossly indebted, ruining their families to no fault of their own, and so by banning gambling, we're helping them as well.

It's not only harm to your own self.

Second argument: moving on to some of the practical effects of this ban.

So opposition often say: listen, if we ban gambling, than a black market will develop, that will involve all sorts of other illegal activities, and all sorts of criminal types, which will make the gamblers' lives much more complicated.

Legalizing gambling helps us superviso and protect gamblers, and so on and so on.

So here's our response: black markets never actually go away just by legalizing the thing that they're dealing in.

They can very much coexist alongside the legal market.

If we legalize gambling, it' it will become much more accessible to many more people, who would be duped into the world of gambling, and end up in the black market anyway, pawning their cars and houses, because the accumulated debts that they have no other way of paying.

And so, in this particular example, we think that the legal market would just intensify the black market, and it's preferable to ban it, and try and deal with the small black market that exists today, and as sadly, always has and always will.

And for all of these reasons, we are very glad to propose.

"
"daniel_221_ban-gambling_pro_opening","221","PRO","daniel","","We should ban gambling because gambling is essentially a way for corporations to steal money away or for governments to steal money away from poor people.

And I think this is a real problem.

So, when you look at like the opulent casinos in places like las vegas or even the opulent casinos in places like florida, where I grew up, one of the common things you wonder is where do they get all of the money for these kinds of things?

Where did they get all the money to fund these kinds of operations?

And the reason for that is clear.

They get all this money because they're essentially stealing, in the overall cases, millions upon millions of dollars, probably billions of dollars from the from people.

And they do this in rather insidious ways.

It happens over time, it happens on the individual level but never the less, when it keeps happening over and over again it's billions of dollars that is being taken away from individual people.

So, I think that first and foremost the government should ban and paternalize it because I think this is money poorly spent.

I think that any amount of money that is being spent on gambling is money that could be spent on anything more useful.

It could be spent on like any kind of good or service.

It could be spent on like education, it could be spent on pretty much anything that's more useful than just wasting it and giving it to a corporation that provides almost no services at all.

But I think that what's even more insidious, is that oftentimes the government props up gambling.

So when you look at places so when you look at things like a lottery for example, which are a form of gambling, this is essentially just trying to like trick the average person into spending whatever amount of money they have, whether it's five dollars or ten dollars or whatever, and spending that money on a pointless thing.

Because of the end of the day the odds of actually winning in those gambling situations are incredibly unlikely and you're basically just throwing that money away, and I think that's a big problem.

I think that this is where the real focus of the debate is.

Because when you talk about like small scale individual gambling or even like internet gambling, these are things that are so unenforceable.

Like you're never going to be able to regulate gambling between friends, you're probably never going to be able to fully regulate gambling on the internet, so I think that when you ban gambling you're specifically attacking the state who tries to take money from people by a lottery, and you're attacking corporations who try to take money from people in this way.

And I think that therefore this is an incredibly big problem and it is also something that's incredibly feasible.

Because I don't think there's any real way around these kinds of things.

I think that the best case scenario is that maybe people substitute it with other forms of gambling, but I think that a lot of people are going to be may be turned off by having to like do so illegally.

And I think that one of the biggest reasons why people gamble is because there's an assumption that it's harmless, there's an assumption that you're only spending a few dollars, there's an assumption that it's not that big of a deal.

But when it keeps happening over and over again, the money piles up over time and this is where I think the real problems come in and where I think poor choices are truly made.

Government has a duty to stop this so we're very proud to ban gambling.

"
"rachel_381_monarchy_con_opening_james","381","CON","rachel","james","The problem with government is that they rely on the idea that the monarchy is full of awful people who are unrepresentative of the democratic whole and to them ideals.

The problem with this is that they fail to understand exactly how much the monarchy has developed and exactly how little power it has.

First, even the government speaker acknowledges that queen elizabeth has been much more moderate and hasn't actually committed any of the atrocities that they claim have happened.

More than this, let me tell you that it is likely that if queen elizabeth or any other member of the monarchy were to attempt a political coup, they would quickly be disestablished, because at this point it is accepted that their role is as a figurehead and not one that is a political that is political.

What it comes down to is that the monarchy does very little good, but it also does very little bad.

We tell you that the amount of money and energy that would go into lifting the monarchy is thus unnecessary and unjustified, given that they aren't actually committing any harm.

With that, two main areas of clash, the first on public will.

Recent polls have shown that more than three to every one person wants to keep the monarchy.

This means, first, that the majority in a democracy want it to exist.

This, in itself, should be enough, given that a democratic government is one that accepts the majority will of its population.

But even if that's not enough, pragmatically it means it would be very socially challenging to disband and would cause a lot of disfavor to the individual citizens.

It would be expensive and also would cause political anguish among those among like at least three to every one individual living within the UK.

This means it is simply not worth it.

Use this effort elsewhere to create real political change that can benefit lives, rather than removing a relic that hasn't actually caused any harm.

If gov wants to talk about finances, we think that the fact that you would need to create an alternative head of state, fund the overhead costs of that switch in the first, secure like maintain security for the crown in the same time, all of this would be equally expensive in addition to the costs of having to switch over, and in addition to that, the political turmoil that would occur over the method of election or selection of this individual.

Our second area of clash has to do with why we think that the monarchy often serves political good.

We think that as the only beloved part of the government in times when there are contentious decisions being made, it is important not to disband it and increase political unity that you don't see in other states without a monarchy.

In the united states, there is constant anger over the way that congress operates, over the way that the president operates, and oftentimes when this occurs, you see massive distrust within the government, thus fracturing within the nationalism of the population.

The reason you don't see this happen as viciously within england and other UK states is because even when congress is messing up, even when you have problems within branches of the government, you still believe in the queen, you still believe in that figurehead.

We think that it is that when there is turmoil elsewhere, it is good to promote national unity and problematic to take the symbol that does so away.

More than this, we think that the queen other members of the monarchy are often symbols for charity work and other social good.

Because they are expected and turn up at charity events and donate money to good causes and advocate for good causes, we think the population follows.

Much in the way that the first lady of the united states often takes up a cause that they advocate for, we think the members of the monarchy operate in a similar manner.

They show the members of their state how they ought be behaving in a way that is socially good, and others follow.

Finally though, we think that the monarchy attracts tourism in a way that other things don't.

The massive phenomenon of following the marriage of the prince and princess on screen, live tweeting the event, looking at the outfits that their children are wearing, all of this attracts massive amount of popular massive amounts of people to the area in order to even catch a glance or look at where they live.

We think that this kind of income is also something that disappears when you abolish the monarchy.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"will_381_monarchy_con_opening_yaar","381","CON","will","yaar","I am proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should abolish monarchies.

Before getting into my independent points, I'd like to offer a small bit of clarification.

For the purposes of this debate, I will refer to monarchies like the UK as weak monarchies.

These are monarchies where there's not a lot of central power-making, decision-making rather, given to the monarch.

I will refer to strong monarchies as well, meaning countries like saudi arabia, countries like qatar, where the monarch actually has decision-making power that is more or less absolute over the entire country.

With that, two independent points.

The first is that monarchies afford stability.

I think this plays out in very different ways between weak and strong monarchies.

In weak monarchies, this is through a sense of morale.

This is, as gov admits, a cultural point of the country, but I think it's notable that it's not just a historical thing, that this isn't just something that is, "" oh well, this was part of our history, so we should just continue doing it for the sake of preserving our history. ""

I don't think that's what it is.

I think it has a modern-day value, that there is this sense of confidence established in your government, by some sort of central figure, that is often above the fray of politics and above the petty infighting.

And as such, it allows people to have a significant amount of confidence in their government.

I think you can see this in the UK where, even if there's a lot of attention between tories and the labour party, you're still going to see a lot of confidence in the queen.

That's important, because it means that people have a sense of confidence in their government, that they feel secure with the country that they're living in, that they are happy in this place, and as a result that they are confident that their government is working to do things that will assist them.

That peace of mind is valuable, but it's also valuable in mitigating the amount of vitriol that is present in politics.

Look to the united states as an example of when this can get extremely out of hand, that without that mitigating force, things can get outright dangerous, through things like acts of violence perpetuated by members of particular parties.

And as a result of that, we think that the monarchy is a reasonable tradeoff.

But even looking at strong monarchies, I think there is still incredible value the in the stability provided there.

For one thing, there isn't uncertainty in decision-making decision-making patterns.

When you look to something like the united states, there's a lot of fluctuation between what's happening on one day or in one election cycle or another.

Over the course of two years, the landscape of who's running the country can shift drastically, and that has extreme implications on our foreign policy, on our domestic policy, on the way people feel about their government.

That instability is a problem.

But secondly, it mitigates power cycles.

So, what I mean by this is that in democracies, there are often lots of conflicting forces based on electoral incentives that compel actors to act in ways that they don't actually think is reasonable.

A lot of policy makers, for example, will pursue things like unreasonable protections for gun owners, or ridiculous health care policies, or any number of things that people do genuinely understand are bad ideas, but they have electoral incentives, driven by people that don't understand the policies very well, to make bad decisions.

This isn't true for monarchies.

They don't have to act in this way.

They don't have to be accountable to individuals that aren't understanding of the ways in which governments work.

But furthermore, they don't have to worry about things like lobbyists, because they're above that fray.

They don't have to worry about their campaign coffers and as a result, monied interests don't affect them.

Our second independent briefly independent point briefly is that the means by which you would achieve abolishing monarchies are questionable.

This isn't going to happen voluntarily, so I think really the only way they can accomplish this is with some sort of violent revolution.

Generally speaking, these cause a lot of suffering and a lot of pain.

I think even if you buy that, on net, the arguments brought forward by gov are slightly preferable, something like the current civil war in syria, I think that amount of suffering makes it not worth the transition into a slightly better form of government, even if you buy that it is better.

Proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_381_monarchy_pro_opening","381","PRO","yaar","","We should abolish the monarchy.

Before we begin, we need to clarify something because there are some different models and types of monarchies in the world, starting from models where the monarch is the de facto ruler with absolute authority on political decisions made, like in saudi arabia or qatar, to models where the monarch is a more diplomatic and symbolic figure with hardly any authority when it comes to policy, like in great britain.

For the purposes of this debate, we will argue that all these models need to give way in favor of a democratic republic.

Of course, the more authorities that the monarch has, the bigger our problem because becomes.

We'll have two points.

First, I'll explain the rationale of why we had monarchies to begin with and why this rationale is no longer relevant today.

And secondly, I'll discuss the inherent harms in a monarchy under all models.

So first point: monarchs all used to hold absolute authorities, and the legitimacy for their rule is that they were somehow able to persuade the people that they had some divine right to rule.

The royal family were nearly godlike, and that's why the title passes on in a hereditary fashion.

Now, the rationale that justifies it was that we needed some one ruler above everyone else to dictate the rules so that we can have order and avoid anarchy.

If there is no one that we can all agree that has the legitimate authority to set rules and enforce them, then everyone do as they please, which is bad for everyone.

Therefore, it's best to sacrifice some of our liberties to this monarch and get a functioning society.

But as time went by and people started becoming more aware of their own rights and demanding things from their kings, the authorities of the monarchs dwindled down until we reach the current model of a democratic republic.

And now, we obviously have plenty of examples to countries without a monarch that don't have anarchy in the streets.

All that is needed is a functioning government, a parliament that sets laws and courts who enforce them.

Thus, the old logic and rational for monarchs is no longer valid today.

The new rationale given sometimes, especially in britain, is that this institution is ingrained in their tradition and culture of this country.

And, you know, all of this may be true, but nostalgia and romanticism can only get you so far.

This is exactly what museums are for.

We're not saying that they should just forget all about their history, but it's just like vikings are a very important part of the nordic countries' history and it it doesn't mean that they should go and ravage the seas today.

We should put that behind us if no stronger rationale exists.

A monarchy comes at very high costs, and we don't think that it's worth it just for nostalgia's sake.

This brings me to my second point.

Along the years, there have been good kings and there have been bad kings.

But the biggest problem is inherently that the people can't control what their king does, except maybe for during violent revolutions when they try and overthrow the monarch.

And this is, of course, something that we would like to prevent in the future, because many people tend to die in those.

Now, because the title passes on through heritage, the king needn't worry about his seat and can pretty much do as he pleases.

In absolute monarchies, this is still true to this very day.

On top of that, having grown up in a palace, even if the king wishes well, most times he's just not really connected and fully aware of what the average citizen in his country needs.

This is exactly what democratic republics are meant to fix.

Of course, there can also be good governments and bad governments, but the head of state always knows that if he doesn't please the people, he will be removed, and this is the biggest check and balance on the power of the government.

That's important.

But even in constitutional monarchies, where the king is not a political figure per se, like the UK, there still is a huge price to pay for this monarchy.

Firstly, money.

It costs a lot of money to maintain buckingham palace and the lavish lifestyle of the royal family.

There also security costs, of course, and costs of expeditions abroad that all come from the taxpayers' payroll, taxpayers who did not choose this monarch, not legitimate.

Moreover, there's just something wrong about having a-class citizens in the form of royal families.

This fixates the class system, and ugly relic from less enlightened times.

For all these reasons, please propose.

"
"james_381_monarchy_pro_opening","381","PRO","james","","We should abolish the monarchy.

So in this debate in order to give some clarity because obviously the nature of the monarchy in saudi arabia is very different from in canada, we're going to focus on commonwealth countries.

These are constitutional monarchies where queen elizabeth has some legal authority but in general the countries are run completely democratically, comparably two republics like france or the united states, except that the queen is the source of legal authority and the head of state.

So with this in mind we have three main arguments.

The first is about the finances that the crown cost to maintain.

We see that in britain for instance, huge amounts of government properties are maintained for the private benefit of the royal family.

Palaces like balmoral up in scotland ultimately cost the british taxpayer thousands and thousands of dollars to maintain, while only small parts of these cultural treasures are open to tourists or the general public.

So we think that if the monarchy were abolished, what would ultimately happen financially is that we think certain cultural properties like balmoral or buckingham palace would remain property of the public, which they are right now, and that other properties of less cultural significance which are currently privately held by the royal family would become their own property.

So the royals would remain you know multi billionaires, they would certainly be very well off, but the cultural heritage and the tourism money that that brings in would remain in the hands of the british people.

Ultimately we think that what this means is that the british people could avoid subsidizing a family of billionaires while maintaining many of the largest benefits of the royal family, namely tourism.

Our second argument is about the signaling effect that it has to ban the monarchy.

We think that first of all the monarchy is a pretty sordid history in terms of relations with minority members of the british realm and also countries like canada and australia.

We see that during the nineteenth century the monarchy worked assiduously to uphold things like british colonialism in india and that the monarchy condoned the mistreatment of aborigines and first nations peoples in canada.

We think that at that point the monarchy's sorted reputation reflects poorly upon those countries today.

We think that they would do better to create a clean break with the past and move forward with a republican government which doesn't rely for legitimacy on a family whose acts should render them completely illegitimate in the eyes of the public.

Of course, queen elizabeth herself didn't do these things but we think that the fact of the matter is that the monarchy's legitimacy relies on this connection to victoria and her relatives who did all of these terrible things during the colonial period.

The last argument that we'd like to make is about improving international relations.

We think that the commonwealth of nations which is a sort of league of countries which are ruled by queen elizabeth, ultimately does more harm than good for the countries that are members of it in some ways.

We think that because, by its very nature, the commonwealth excludes countries like the united states, like india, which have a lot in common culturally with the current commonwealth members but who don't have a monarchy, that ultimately the commonwealth creates more barriers than benefits.

We think that in a world without the commonwealth that countries like britain and canada would be more likely to pursue closer trade relationships with india and the united states, which ultimately would be economically and culturally beneficial for those countries.

We think that right now the existence of the monarchy may not be the greatest barrier to cooperation but that the commonwealth that she creates because she is the head of state of so many countries, ultimately is not a beneficial community for its members.

That they would be better off pursuing other more organic connections based on current interests rather than on a shared legacy of rule by the windsor family.

For these reasons we should abolish the monarchy.

Thank you.

In a debate that is very emotional.

In a situation that is very emotional.

You can't always ignore what's going on with the woman just because you prefer to look away and weigh utilitarian costs.

There's more to anguish than just well anguish is you know not as bad as death.

I'm gonna discuss a few things on my side of the house and through my discussion of the of why partial birth abortions must be allowed I'm also going to oppose what was said on the government side of the house.

So first let's address the question when is partial birth abortion actually utilized?

Let's put some context into this debate because no woman waits until their second or third trimester to abort a fetus just for fun.

On well, I'll just go through five, six, seven months of morning sickness, which is actually all day long sickness, feeling a baby a fetus kicking around inside of me, feeling sick, having emotional ups and downs, growing this fetus inside of me but now it just changed my mind.

That is rarely the case.

That is almost never the case.

What we are talking about are specific types of cases where the mother's at risk either physically or emotionally, or the fetus is at risk, or the mother simply didn't know she was pregnant until it is too late to have any other kind of abortion.

We think, and that is often in the case of teen pregnancies, we think these are all that these all give us a little bit more contextual understanding of who this woman is standing in front of us.

This is somebody who who has I mean the anguish of having a parasite inside your womb, kicking you from within, that it's not something that can simply be disregarded and said well death is worse.

You know what, death is not what we're talking about here.

Partial birth abortion is the termination of a pack of cells.

It's not a life.

It might be a potential life but it's not a life yet.

Right now, and this brings me to my second point, a fetus is simply a parasite inside the woman's body and the woman is the one with bodily autonomy.

She must have complete autonomy over her body and that means up until the very minute that the parasite is out of her, that the fetus is out of her, she should have complete control over what happens to it.

Until the fetus is delivered they the fetus is totally reliant on the woman's body.

It is a parasite.

It is her decision.

Fetuses literally suck calcium from a woman's bones, they steal nutrients, they abuse the mother's body from within.

It has to be a women's choice to terminate the pregnancy at any stage throughout especially bearing in mind that it's rarely that it's really done outside of very extreme circumstances.

We say this idea that like it's clear the fetus would be able to survive at this point.

We say, first of all, it's not clear at all.

There's a good reason why it's inside the womb for nine months.

It needs those nutrients.

It needs that protective atmosphere in order to to grow and develop and it's a very it's not clear at all that a fetus would survive earlier than in eight through nine month birth but second of all to what end are we talking about here?

Right like if we can grow a fetus outside of the womb completely, does that mean that women will never be allowed to have an abortion, will never be able to decide actually this was a mistake I took I I took protective measures, or I was raped or whatever it is, and they won't be allowed to won't be allowed to terminate at all?

What about men masturbating?

Is that going to be not allowed because you'll be able to facilitate out of the womb out of the womb conception?

We think that these are things that you need to take into account when you're talking about this life.

The fact is that the only way we can determine life is once it is actually independent in and of itself, before that, the woman must have bodily autonomy.

"
"will_642_partial-birth-abortions_con_opening_tim","642","CON","will","tim","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should ban partial birth abortions.

So two independent points.

First on the right to an abortion and why this procedure is facilitative to that right.

Gov gives you a pretty good explanation of why there's a positive right to abortion.

So I don't think that I need to rehash that too extensively but I do just want to note that first, there is not really a good standard by which to apply rights to a fetus, but secondly, that there is a bodily autonomy claim that is extremely important for these women.

I think both of these justifications though are important because they don't change with the time frame in which you're actually applying the abortion.

Like if the fetus doesn't have rights it's because they don't have consciousness or because you know a potential person probably just isn't worth as much as an actual person in terms of how we apportion life.

Likewise with bodily autonomy your bodily autonomy does not go out the window just because you made the decision a couple months later.

Both of these are really important then because you continue having that right to an abortion even in like your eighth month of pregnancy or whatever.

Given that, we think that there are grounds for needing this something like term changes and circumstance for how you would be capable of raising a child.

You know suicidal depression which often can take a long time to develop if the you know pregnancy was for reasons that are actually necessarily triggering that can actually trigger like mental illnesses.

This is important because insofar as there is any grounds for needing this, we think that there should be a positive right to accessing the procedure.

Recognize that this isn't a popular option.

It's like point two percent of all abortions and there's a good reason for that.

Not just the ban, but because people don't like doing it.

All the reasons that gov explains to you as to why this is a very visceral thing that people aren't wild about, are also reasons why people don't like to do it themselves.

This isn't something that happens frequently but we think that it's only used in extreme circumstances where it's exceptionally necessary, where there really isn't another option and as a result of that we need to preserve the right to actually have this procedure.

Our second independent point is politics.

So we think that gov's real case really rests in this because they're first point that oh well you know they can do it sometime else in the procedure isn't really an argument the generous offense, that's just mitigating defense but the politics argument that they put forward that you know this is really visceral and people will be upset by it, anti-abortion advocates will latch on to it as a way to do you know sort of demonstrate the horrors of abortion or whatever we think that actually quite the opposite happens that instituting a band gives an inch to anti-abortion acts activists by creating a precedent in like public discourse for fetal rights.

This implicitly admits that there is some bright line at which you know the fetus actually house rights, that they have personhood, and should be protected and I think this is really silly when you actually think about the underlying logic here right?

Like if they have rights then you ban abortion outright because they're people.

If they don't have rights, then there really shouldn't be any type of abortion that should be illegal because they don't have rights.

Like it's an either or situation and having a gray zone doesn't make any sense fundamentally and I think people realize this.

Like when you have bans on partial birth abortions and you implicitly admit that this is something that should be unacceptable, then people latch on to this as a result as a you know just as an admission essentially that fetuses have rights.

This is a problem then for people that actually want to increase access to these procedures because it spreads the increases the spread of anti-abortion arguments and the normalization of this type of discourse in the country.

I think this is a really big issue and generally speaking, you should be going for the holistic argument, one that is logically consistent, one that says look fetuses just don't have rights.

They are not people and as a result we think that it's really silly to extend them this right by banning these types of procedures.

Proud to oppose.

"
"james_642_partial-birth-abortions_pro_opening","642","PRO","james","","We should ban partial birth abortions.

So what this debate is about is abortions that are performed in the late second or in the third trimester of the pregnancy.

In which the fetus is partially extracted, and has its brain scooped out by a doctor and then the fetus is removed.

So these abortions are performed for many reasons.

Some might be performed at the mother's request, others might be performed for the safety of the mother or because the fetus has already died, but we are opposed to this in any instance where it isn't medically required.

So, with that in mind we have two main arguments.

The first of which is that killing a fetus that is able to feel pain, is ultimately wrong.

We're not contending that the fetus is the same as a baby that has already been born, but what we are saying is that if you look at the net harm to the fetus versus the mother, you're going to weigh down on the side of the fetus in every single instance.

Why is this true?

Let's consider the worse case where a mother has severe illness or mental health harms that are actually being suffered from her by the pregnancy.

We would be okay with this in those instances because there is a clear and present danger to the mother's life in the form of mental illness.

But at other times, when a person may not want to bring a child to term, but isn't experiencing this anguish or mental illness, we think that it's true that there is a certain amount of suffering and disutility going on, but the loss of all future utility to that fetus, compounded with the disutility of having itself be killed by a doctor, clearly you're always going to weigh those harms much more highly.

We see that for instance the anguish caused by this pregnancy, is going to be temporary, whereas the harm of being dead, ultimately weighs on forever.

But aside from that, we see that although the fetus isn't a person right now, it's clearly has the potential to develop into one.

Many children are born prematurely at an and survive at an age when this type of abortion would be performed.

So it's clear that the fetus would be able to survive and develop into a healthy human given the opportunity.

So at the end of the day we think that it is fundamentally unethical to kill a fetus that has the potential to become a citizen in the future, and that on top of that in your moral decision making, you want always consider more highly the person who served or being that serves to lose the most, rather than the being that serves to have the most rights in the status quo.

This is why for instance, even though animals obviously have lesser moral standing than humans, we still don't let people have cock fights, say.

Because although there might be utility for the people who practice that sport, the disutility to the roosters is much greater.

Now, we're not trying to compare these mothers who want an abortion to cock fighters, but we do think that at the end of the day it would be unethical for the state not to consider what is best for the fetus given this tremendous amount of disutility versus the utility to the mother which, though not marginal, is still lesser.

Our second argument is that we think that it is unjust or unethical for doctors to participate in these partial birth abortions.

Remember that when someone becomes a medical doctor, they swear the hippocratic oath, which basically states they will never do any intentional harm to a human being.

Now, it's questionable at what point a fetus become a person, but certainly they are a human being in the biological sense.

We think that doctors ought not be performing this late term abortion that involves killing a fetus therefore, because that fetus, one, is going to develop into a person, and two, meets our standards for what a human is, namely, the ability to continue on as a human being, I suppose.

But whatever standard you want to use, we think that doctors are violating one of the oaths that they took, a very serious one moreover, when they perform this type of abortion.

We think that the government should step in to prevent them from doing so.

Since the state takes responsibility for regulating doctors and for managing medical ethics, so there's a clear precedent for government to intervene to prevent doctors from committing misdeeds and ultimately this would fall into that category.

So for these two reasons, we should ban partial birth abortions.

Thank you.

"
"tim_642_partial-birth-abortions_pro_opening","642","PRO","tim","","Partial birth abortions.

So before we start the debate, we also want to say that as part of banning this type of abortion, we want to say that if you were to do this, you would also allow more open access to abortion and the first trimester to ensure that women have the option of getting an abortion.

We don't want to ban this type of abortion and additionally ban other types of abortion.

We want to expand the access to others, but we think that this type of abortion isn't justified, and we think it's actively harmful to women and women's rights.

Okay, so first we're going to talk about what justifies abortion and why this doesn't meet that justification, and secondly we're gonna talk about the negative political will associated with partial-birth abortion.

So firstly, on justification.

We think that there are a couple of main justifications for abortion in the status quo.

We think the primary justification is that based on a balancing of rights, abortion should be allowed, that women's bodily autonomy outweighs the fetus's right to life, for the fact that at the time when a woman would have an abortion, a fetus is not viable.

It isn't capable of using its cognizance, it isn't able to make judgments, it isn't able to live outside of the womb of the mother and therefore, is entirely dependent on that mother.

We think that this is an unfair expectation to place on a woman, and we think that there are numerous reasons why a woman might want to have an abortion that are entirely justified and don't mean that she opted into having that child, for example, in cases of rape, in cases where birth control proved ineffective but the woman took all proper steps to ensure that she wouldn't get pregnant.

And we think that a woman's ability to use her bodily autonomy, to choose how her body is going to interact with the world around her and what is going to happen to her body, especially with something as drastic as carrying a child to term and giving birth, we think that this is something that a woman should have full autonomy in making the decision of, especially given the case that early in the early in the pregnancy, a fetus is not capable, is not a viable living creature.

And we think that arguments for potentiality open a paradox in which we give preference to potential creatures, to potential life in all instances, and we make things such as masturbation and things like that and having sex for reasons other than intercourse, we think you would also have to ban those things under a potentiality argument, because all sperm could become a child, all egg could become a child.

And we think that a potentiality argument just leads to a slippery slope.

But we think in the case of a partial birth in the case of late late-term abortions, we don't think that these same arguments hold up.

You're at a point in which the child, the fetus, has become viable and therefore the question is no longer one of potentiality, but one of weighing the right to life that this living creature, this viable creature, has against the rights to bodily autonomy of the woman, especially because if you increase access to abortion other times, we think that the woman has had full capability of expressing her bodily autonomy, has had full has had the full range of time and opportunity to do so and in not choosing to do so earlier, we think the right of the fetus then outweighs the mother in the long run.

Okay, secondly, on political will.

We think that because partial-birth abortions are such a dramatic and kind of visceral thing that can be portrayed in the media by anti-abortion activists and other groups of the like, we think that by banning partial-birth abortion, you're more likely to get political will for other types of abortion.

We think that when people can paint abortions, all abortions, as this kind of viscerally negative thing, it increases political will from those on the fence, from moderates, against abortion for all.

We think that by banning partial-birth abortion, you make it less likely that these types of visceral images are going to come out, less likely that anti-abortion activists are going to be able to paint this as all abortions, and therefore more likely that in the long run, more women are able to express their bodily autonomy than if you keep partial-birth partial-birth abortions as an actual option.

For these reasons, we should ban partial-birth abortions.

"
"will_681_ip-rights_con_opening_hayah","681","CON","will","hayah","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that intellectual property rights should be abolished.

I have three independent points.

First, that it reduces the incentive to create.

Second, that principally we deserve the products of our own labor and thirdly, that international competition will likely punish countries that do this to an extreme extent.

So on the first argument that it reduces the incentive to create, I think this is hinted at in gov's arguments where they are like well you know some people say this.

I think people say that for a pretty good reason right?

Like we're recognize it like if you are a person producing medicine, like if you are a pharmaceutical company, you just don't have an incentive to create that medicine because you're investing billions of dollars into it and then as soon as you like actually put this thing on the market someone's going to release a knock off of it, like steal up like half of your market share possibly more and you're the one that has to burden the entire cost of production in the first place.

So you literally don't make enough money to make up for the initial expenditures that allowed you to engage in the production of this medicine.

That's really important because when they talk about patent trolls or price gouging or anything like that, that is a like the terminal harm of that.

One hundred percent of the time is just not accessing the medicine but that doesn't happen always right?

There are instances in where we avoid these realities where the products are able to reach consumers in a reasonable way.

The comparative then, where the products just don't get produced in the first place, that means that by definition you are always going to have less access to these life saving drugs.

You are always going to have less access to any product that is protected by intellectual property rights that is systemically important to the existence of to our society.

Given that I think the worst case scenario is always realized on their side of the house because the actual fundamental incentives of a corporation to make money are violated by the passage of this motion and as a result you just lose your infrastructure necessary to create these things.

My second independent argument is that principally people should just have intellectual property rights because they created these things.

On government they try to tell you oh well you know things like music for example are like the composite of like long long kinds of history in like work that came before it.

I think there's a couple problems with this.

First is that the way we combine things is in itself unique right?

Like I pick up a rock and I pick up some water and I make some cool thing out of the combination of those two things, that is a meaningfully new thing and I put in labor and I used my ingenuity to create that new thing.

So it is worth recognizing that this isn't the property of the people that might have created the rock or the water or whatever, this is my thing because I made this unique item and I actually put in meaningful input that changed the landscape.

So combination is something that is deserving of a of an ownership claim but also recognize that the most blatant examples of this, like say sampling for example in music, do require you to actually pay money to the person that initially created the things.

Like a lot of the time the way we combine things requires payments to those who came before us.

So I think the status quo is perfectly capable of solving for the harms that are described by side government right?

But on an even more fundamental level, I just deserve my own work.

I put a thing into it like I actually utilized my own labor and time and resources and money or whatever and that means that I actually am entitled to the existence of this to the ownership over this thing that I created.

That this is mine.

At the most fundamental level our autonomy is contingent on the idea that we actually maintain ownership over our own things, over our own creations, because that is what allows us to act reasonably within this world.

How we our ownership of a property is literally how we maintain agency because we are able to protect ourselves with our property.

The last argument I'd like to advance then is international competition.

I think this is unclear by the model whether or not international competition is a thing because like it's unclear if just one country is doing this but recognize that if just one country is doing this this is a terrible idea because your products are no longer protected but everybody else's is.

So you're at a massive market disincentive.

I think this just destroy your economy in so far as you have no capacity to compete in the international market and as a result all this ingenuity all the things that matter so deeply to side government just go out the window once you don't have this protection in your own labor force in your own in your own production capacity.

Proud to oppose.

"
"tim_681_ip-rights_con_opening_james","681","CON","tim","james","We should not abolish intellectual property rights.

So in this debate we want to talk about two main arguments.

The first is about fairness and the second is about innovation and social utility.

So first, on fairness.

Broadly, we would say that property rights are important and ought be protected.

We would say that people exert effort, time and put their own labor into the products of their creation, and because they are the sole creators or the primary creators of their products, we think that they deserve to have control over that product, the control to have a they deserve to have a property right over that product.

If you buy that this is the case, and for the vast majority of countries there's an obvious there are obvious laws protecting property rights, we would say that intellectual property is no philosophically different from physical property that has been protected by modern states since their conception.

We would say that intellectual property requires the exertion of immense amounts of mental effort, immense amounts of innovation, and immense amounts of investment from individuals.

And we think that intellectual property clearly has intense market value.

It clearly has this market value that is a part of its own creation.

And because of this, if you do not guarantee the protection of that of that property right for the people that have created it, people are still going to profit off of these intellectual property creations.

This isn't just going to sit in the ether and everyone is going to be able to freely use it.

It just means that people that watch this intellectual property be created will be able to package it and that corporations will be able to sell it as their own without any sort of royalty going to the creator of this property.

Given that there is a profit that is going to be generated from valuable intellectual property, we think that it is most fair that that profit is in the hands of those that created it, those that exerted the effort, that created the knowledge that composes this intellectual property.

They should be the ones that are able to control this.

For example, if you created a song, if you're a songwriter and you made the song, we think that you should have the ability to determine where that song is played and who gets to use it.

For example, many people don't allow politicians to use their music, because they are associated with that music in their brand associated with that music and they don't want it to be politicized, or they disagree with the politician, and we think that that is entirely fair.

And without intellectual property rights, instances like that would not allow the creator to be protected.

The second thing we want to talk about though is innovation.

We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts, they get to profit off of their intellectual property.

What this means is that there's a market incentive in the status quo to be innovative.

But if you remove that profit incentive, we think you get a free rider problem in which all people know that they can profit off of other individuals' creations and there's no incentive to invest the time and effort yourself in order to create valuable IP, because you can just take the IP from others and repackage it and rebrand it.

What this means en masse is that you're going to have less market innovation, and this has real world implications.

In the tech world, in the health industry, intellectual property is incredibly important to these sectors, and these are the sectors that are driving global growth and global innovation.

These are the things that allow for longer life spans.

These are the things that allow for more leisure leisure time in individual's lives and for a higher quality of life for the average person.

We think that these sectors in particular are vulnerable if you remove intellectual property rights and that these sectors are driving global growth in the status quo.

By removing intellectual property rights, we think you remove an immense amount of the innovation that currently exists, and you harm global growth as a result.

For these reasons, we should not abolish intellectual property rights.

"
"hayah_681_ip-rights_pro_opening","681","PRO","hayah","","Intellectual property rights are the protection of things you create for a limited amount of time.

This includes everything from songs and catch phrases to life-saving medicines.

The government already recognizes that intellectual property rights should not last forever, and it already recognizes that there are caveats to intellectual property rights, such as the fair use act, where if you're using something to critique it or satirize it, that would be allowed.

Ostensibly, intellectual property rights are protecting economic growth because it's hard to keep inventing and creating if your creations can be copied.

However, we think that pretending the creations belong to any one person or corporation is absurd, and the government needs to abolish intellectual property rights to encourage growth and to encourage creation and to allow for life-saving medicines to really save lives, instead of just turn a profit for a company.

So first of all, we think that creations are almost always an amalgamation of work.

We think that taylor swift might have done a lot of work for her songs but when we say that she owns her intellectual property rights over her songs, we are ignoring the fact that hundreds of people worked on the creation and they are not getting fair remuneration for what they have done.

We think that it puts the spotlight on one specific person in an unfair way that ignores the fact that there are usually many more people involved in the process of creation than is being rewarded by the intellectual property right patents.

We think that that's a problem that is not addressed under the current law, and when we abolish intellectual property rights, it will be more it will be more there'll be more fair recognition for the people involved in in creating different products.

We also think that natural resources owned by the state are often used in creating intellectual property, whether we're talking about artists who are inspired by nature or medical research companies that use plants and animals to test new theories or even grants that are given to artists and to corporations in order to to create new products and new and new material.

We think that natural resources belong to the people of the country, and we think that it is only fair that they are also allowed to reap the benefits of it, without having to pay exorbitant prices set by these companies, corporations and artists, in order to view their work or benefit from their products.

We think it's very difficult to say who things really belong to, and allowing a narrow group to reap such huge rewards is a problem and it's wrong.

We also think that it limits new creations by causing fear of inspiration.

Your fear, your corporations, companies, new scientists, new research proposals and artists are always in fear of being sued by other companies or other artists, and are limiting themselves in their new creations and they're limiting what they could be doing for fear of being sued by other companies and being told that they are copying or infringing on intellectual property rights.

We think that this negates the problem of the that that it's absurd to think that there's only more growth from intellectual property rights.

We think that it, in fact, limits it to a great extent by causing fear in in different industries.

And finally, we think that in many industries there's an even bigger problem, one of exploiting one of exploiting these rights to make a profit at the expense of others' lives.

So we have a lot of life-saving medicines and other types of medicines that could alleviate pain, this is particularly in the medical industry, where we could be alleviating pain from people, saving lives, and yet these are medicines that are marked up by hundreds of percents by companies in order for them to turn a quick profit before time runs out on their intellectual property rights and and generics and generic medicines flood the market.

We think that lives are lost in in the pursuit of greed when we have intellectual property rights in the way that they are today.

We think that this property is questionable to begin with, because we think that more people deserve recognition for the work that goes into the products and for the and the creations that are made.

We think that in order to encourage creativity, growth, and to save more lives, we should abolish intellectual property rights.

"
"james_681_ip-rights_pro_opening","681","PRO","james","","We should abolish intellectual property rights.

So, by intellectual property rights, or IP rights if you prefer, we mean things that are the creations of the mind.

We're talking about patents, copyrights and artistic creations, among many other things of similar nature.

Three arguments for why we should abolish IP rights.

The first is about spurring more innovation.

So recognize that copyrights and patents in particular serve to limit the ability to innovate.

If one person comes up with a really good idea, nobody else is free to build upon that idea for as long as it's held under copyright.

We see that, for instance, think about computing technology.

You have new chipsets that are created by a company like intel, and then for the next twenty five years no one but intel is allowed to innovate based off of that chipset without intel's permission, which means that either intel can charge other companies a bunch of money to license the property, at which point they have a huge competitive advantage and also prices are higher for consumers and this slows innovation, or we rely on one company to innovate in-house, which means that you have fewer great minds thinking about an issue, and ultimately this slows down development and innovation in general.

What this means is that you don't get new computer technology that can save lives in the medical sphere, you don't get new medications as quickly, because we have to wait for things to go generic before we can innovate based on them.

Ultimately we think that many lives would be saved and quality of life would be higher if we abolished IP rights.

Our second argument is about why we think that this would help your country compete, because recognize if we're talking about abolishing IP rights, we must mean that we're doing this at a national level.

So, a given country, canada, say, should abolish IP rights.

Right now countries with very strong intellectual property protections are hamstrung by those same protections.

Other countries in the developing world especially are ignoring IP protections.

In china they aren't respecting US copyrights on things like software and drugs, they are stealing intellectual property, and because of that they're able to develop a lot of new goods very cheaply, they're able to provide quality services to their people at a lower cost.

Your country is being outcompeted if you don't do the same thing.

Because at the end of the day there's a sort of prisoner's dilemma.

If everyone respected property rights, then it would be kind of reasonable to continue to respect them.

But at the point where you know that other countries like india, like china, are cheating the system, you are just harming your business's ability to compete by choosing to respect those IP rights.

You are denying your people access to cheap drugs and cheap equipment to do their jobs.

So we think that your country would be more competitive, and therefore as a government you have a clear incentive to abolish IP rights, to allow your country to thrive.

Our third argument and final point is about why we think this would be culturally beneficial.

Realize that when one company owns culturally significant art or intellectual property, then that makes it more difficult for other artists and groups to engage with that property.

We think that, for instance, many characters that are very significant in western culture today, like mickey mouse, being held under copyright, limits the ability of small artists or people from different cultural backgrounds to access this cultural heritage.

We think it would be preferable if art was treated as a common property which everyone could engage with and innovate in and develop on top of, and that this would lead to the best possible art emerging from this sort of marketplace of ideas, where everyone could compete freely without government protection for certain artists and certain ideas.

So for these reasons, because we get more innovation, because it would make your country more competitive, and because we get better art, we should abolish intellectual property rights.

Thank you.

"
"daniel_683_windpower_con_opening_will","683","CON","daniel","will","We should not further exploit wind power.

And the reason we shouldn't further exploit wind power is because on the comparative it's not really all that great of a form of energy.

I don't really think that this is necessarily a comparative between whether we should exploit wind power versus oil and gas.

I think that when power is probably better than oil and gas, but at the point at which you're making a decision to exploit wind power, that over something that's cheaper but more environmentally destructive like oil or natural gas, then you probably have the capability to invest in alternative forms of green energy besides wind power.

So things like solar energy or hydroelectric energy.

So I think that if you're going to invest in , obviously you should invest in some kind of a green type comparatively, because it's a lot better than oil and gas for the environment, which is incredibly important right now so we don't all die.

But as far as choosing the best form of of alternative energy or green energy, I think that when power is vastly inferior to alternatives like solar energy for a couple of reasons: first and foremost I think that wind energy comes a lot more possible harms the environment than alternatives like solar energy.

And the first reason for this is that setting up wind farms is bad for the for like habitats of certain animals.

So it can disrupt like bird migration patterns and it can kill birds.

That's like a widely documented thing.

And that's not good because birds are important.

You don't want to disrupt bird migration patterns.

You don't kill birds, they didn't do anything wrong.

You're like putting wind turbines in the middle of where they're flying and that's not right.

But also oftentimes , the, like, places where wind turbines are most effective, where it's windiest, are on the like are by the ocean or by the water, places where ecosystems are oftentimes more fragile.

Like you may have like there, you have a lot more animal life in the area, like in shallow waters, you have animals that like live around there too, you have birds that go there obviously, like sea animals.

And there's all kinds of ways in which having like fast moving wind turbines can be really destructive to natural ecosystems.

Much more so than solar panels, which you can just like plop on a roof or plop on roads or in the middle of the desert where there isn't all that much stuff, and they work pretty well and they don't really get in the way of much.

But in addition to that, I also think that they can be more effective in their use.

Like solar energy can be more much more effective than its use if exploited compared to wind farms, wind power.

And there's a few reasons for this: first and foremost because of the potential for energy.

So the sun is just an infinitely stronger source of energy than the wind.

Like like the wind is fine but the sun has a lot more energy.

Like, the problem with solar energy right now is we're not able to tap a lot of the potential energy, but that's the point.

Potential energy.

The potential is there, because the sun is a lot stronger.

So you're able to get more out of it if you keep exploiting it if you exploit solar power.

It's going to yield more benefits most likely.

But I also think that it's more diverse in the locations that you can put it in.

Like if you have to put wind turbines by a beach because like beaches are more windy or in the ocean, a lot of people won't like that because like it gets in the way of like beaches and or water and things like that.

But it's also if it's in the ocean which is when you're it's farther away from like sources of , it's farther away from where people are living, which means that you're probably gonna lose energy in transmission, in transporting the energy, versus if you just put like solar panels on a roof, that that's like a pretty easy way to get energy.

If you put solar panels on like a park by like a parking lot or a garage, like all kinds of places, they can fit in a lot of places, it's way more efficient and effective.

So for those reasons don't exploit in wind power.

"
"tim_683_windpower_con_opening_hayah","683","CON","tim","hayah","We should not further exploit wind power.

So, what we think is very crucial in this debate is to point out at the start, what the comparative in this round is.

Because we think that, in the status quo, oftentimes different types of renewable energy resources in a free and open market, compete for investments.

The reason for this is that, not a because renewable energies are at this moment not very profitable, and it's not something that investors are looking to eagerly invest in the status quo, so there are a limited amount of investors, and there are limited amount of fungible government funds, that can go into renewable energy resources.

Other funds are going into fossil fuels, and those types of energies, and we don't think that this is really about, whether or not we can get that type of revenue, because we think obviously it would be preferable if you could get that type of revenue into wind power, or any renewable power, but this is about, if we're going to put our resources into a certain type of renewable energy, should that type of renewable energy be wind power?

Because we think that, when you're saying which resources people should invest their money into, when there's a necessary tradeoff, we need to talk about what is most efficient, and most likely to come to market and the means that can actually effect real change, in a wide variety of environments.

We simply don't think that wind power is the type of technology that will allow that to be the case.

So we think that there are two better alternatives, in regards to renewable energy resources, that we should exploit instead of wind power, given the fungabilities, and the limits of spending in the status quo.

So firstly, we think solar power is immensely more preferable to wind power.

There are few developments in solar power that are crucial to recognize: first, solar power is becoming increasingly more efficient, because solar cells themselves are becoming more efficient.

The technology that allows for these batteries, these solar cell batteries, to store their electricity, the lithium ion batteries, are becoming more and more sophisticated, which means that the cost curve for producing solar power is much lower than that of wind power.

It's simply a more effective way of storing and holding energy, and it's more applicable to smaller scale.

So, whereas you can have wind farms of in different areas like oceans, and you know prairies in fields, and areas that get a lot of wind, these end up feeding into a factory or a plant that disperses energy to like a small geographical area, whereas solar power is something that most homes are capable of, on their own rooftops, getting the type of solar, the type of sun right now, with the current technology of solar power, to to fuel their house and their household needs, for ninety percent of the time.

Given that this is the case, and given that it is a type of technology that isn't limited by by the capability to have a certain amount of wind at your availability, or an immense amount of infrastructure developed to allow these things to come to market in a way that is reasonable, for the average consumer to take in, we would say that solar power is immensely further advanced, especially given that there are companies like solar city, run by elon musk, that already have immense amounts of resources at their disposal, and are already putting products on the market.

We think that, this is the avenue we should go down in regards to renewable resources.

The other alternative that we think is preferable its nuclear energy: recognize in the status quo that nuclear energy is immensely underfunded, and immensely overfeared, because of certain instances, in which nuclear power plants have melted down, but per the amount of nuclear energy, there are actually fewer nuclear accidents than there are from fossil fuels.

And, the potential for nuclear energy is much more massive than any type of other energy, than wind power, than fossil fuels, than solar power can be.

Given that this is the case, we think that, if you're going to invest in something that isn't already dominant on the market, like solar power, if you're going to invest in new technologies, and developments of new technologies, we think that nuclear power has more potential than wind power.

We think both alternatives are preferable to wind power, and for these reasons we should not further exploit wind power.

"
"will_683_windpower_pro_opening","683","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should further exploit wind power.

Generally speaking we'd interpret this to mean that we should invest more money into building the infrastructure intrinsic to wind power so building more wind turbines that sort of thing and connecting it to the general infrastructure.

Two independent points: first is the cheap nature in the long term of renewable energy.

When we look at the type of energy infrastructure that currently is the dominant factor in most countries fossil fuels this is something that is both unsustainable and expensive.

It's expensive because there's a lot of steps intrinsic to using this type of fossil fuel a network that is you have to extract the energy from the ground.

You have to ship the physical product to the place where it's going to be used.

You have to build entire plants that are designed to actually convert that item into energy.

This is a complicated and costly project and while right now it's relatively cheap because these items are in abundance and because the technology is well developed, the long term looks much better for renewable energy.

This isn't just because it's like a thing that renews itself that once you build the wind turbine it just continues producing so the long term costs are lower.

It's also because well firstly it's because you don't have to have that like physical thing you're moving around so you don't have to deal with those costs.

Secondly it's because in the long term you develop the technologies to an extent that the current barriers aren't very meaningful.

So while right now affordable solar technology and affordable wind technology more importantly aren't particularly affordable if you research it they'll become affordable.

But most importantly if you actually want like something that's going to continue providing energy to you fifty years from now finite resources that are rapidly depleting aren't going to do the job.

You're not going to have a sustainable infrastructure for your energy needs if you are relying on something that will cease to exist within the next few decades.

We think wind energy gives you a leg up on those renewables that allow you to have a sustainable infrastructure in the long term.

Our second independent point is global warming.

So broadly speaking we don't think there's enough time in this speech to actually flush out the warrants used to why global warming is true.

We'll just leave it at the fact that ninety seven percent of scientists agree that this is a thing and that generally speaking the climate science that explains the impacts of global warming is an overwhelming consensus.

Most scientists agree that this is a thing that exists and is very very bad for the planet.

When we're talking about those impacts were talking about things like rising sea levels that will destroy coastal and habitations.

We're talking about things like changing weather patterns that threaten the lives of millions of not billions of people around the world.

We're talking about whether pattern changes that will cause mass extinction among animals.

These are huge existential threats to humanity and to other species on this planet.

This is a thing worth avoiding.

And the thing that is contributing to it is fossil fuels and other types of greenhouse gases.

So things like methane things like carbon dioxide that are produced by these types of fuels are a large driving factor in why global temperatures are rising.

If we can mitigate the rate at which we put these types of harmful chemicals into our atmosphere that's always going to be a good thing.

Like even if we can't stop global warming dead in its tracks mitigating the significant impacts of it is always going to be a positive thing for the world.

As such more meaningful investments in wind technology will always come at a zero sum cost to detract the amount we are investing in fossil fuels.

Obviously if we are putting the like political energy into creating sustainable energy infrastructure it will presumably have ripple effects throughout our entire system.

Given that we think that this creates a better environment for the future.

Proud to propose.

"
"hayah_683_windpower_pro_opening","683","PRO","hayah","","It would be difficult for most people around the world today to imagine living without electricity.

Lights, heat, washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, computers, phones, and that's just personal use.

That isn't even looking at it the large scale, such as manufacturing plants and other industries.

And the number of people with access to electricity is growing and that's great.

Except where does it come from?

And what is the cost we are paying for it today?

And what is the cost that we could be paying for it in the future?

That's what this motion is about.

What we think, ladies and gentlemen, on the side of the government, is that we should incentivize research production and use of wind power through subsidies and tax credits.

We're going to discuss three main aspects: first we wanna discuss the dependency that we have on fossil fuels, and the dangers that lie there in, we're gonna discuss the advantages of wind power and whether or not the government has a duty to invest in effective clean and and and effective in clean energy solutions.

So let's look at the first issue, which is the dependency that we have today on fossil fuels.

We think that there are three main dangers and risks involved here: first, we have the health risks to people.

There is pollution, that is growing amounts of pollution around the world from from from all the use of electricity that we have, and it is damaging our health ladies and gentlemen, that is the first and perhaps the most important, or at least the most selfish thing that we can think about and perhaps will spur us to change.

We also have the health risk involved with the collection of fossil fuels.

We think that when people have to deal with oil rigs for example, that's the kind of an industry that presents a very high risk to its workers.

And then of course with the environmental risks which is again the pollution, but here we have to look more towards the long term and what's happening to our environment, and what kind of world are we leaving to our children, right?

We see that wildlife is is being affected by pollution, we see the ozone layer is thinning, we see that global warming is a problem that we need to look to.

And then of course there's the issue of the dangers of dependency on the fossil fuels and why is it so dangerous that we're just depended on one specific type of fuel?

First of all, because we're dependent on countries that control these resources and we think that it's dangerous when your entire energy consumption relies on their prices and their willingness to sell.

We also think that it's dangerous to be dependent on a finite resource and that's why we need to look to something that is not finite.

That there won't, that won't end up just disappearing whether it's a hundred years from now or five hundred years from now or five thousand years from now, we still need to make sure that we can be that we we are independent and not dependent on a finite resource.

So let's look at wind power and what are the advantages of wind power.

We realize that it's not a magical solution, but it is a large part of a solution.

We think that it greatly complements other types of clean energy, and here's why it's so great: first of all, you can use it on both the small scale and large scale.

That means that you can have wind farms, you can have large tracts of land that are currently not being used for anything or being used for wildlife for for agricultural purposes, but can be shared with with wind farms, and we think that that that's great for for larger solutions, but we also think that we can encourage people to privately invest in wind technology.

We think that we can encourage people, where applicable, to to install for example small scale wind turbines in their houses in order to make it small scale as well and make sure that people are utilizing wind to as much as we can.

We think that offshore wind farms are an option and we think that that solves a lot of problems that we have today in terms of land and space and whether people wanna be living near them.

We think it's a safe technology and that's also an important thing to remember.

So does the government have a duty to invest in these clean technologies?

We think absolutely.

They must protect the health of their citizens, they must look out for the future and they must make sure that we are not dependent on a finite resource that is going to run out.

"
"james_881_holocaust-denial_con_opening_tim","881","CON","james","tim","Holocaust denial should not be banned.

We have three arguments for our side.

The first is about why we prefer to challenge bad ideas rather than to hide them.

So, let's think about what it looks like when you ban holocaust denial.

People don't change their minds just because this is now illegal, and they don't stop teaching their children that the holocaust is a lie and things like that.

Instead what happens is that they learn to spread these horrible lies through private channels or ways that only people who think like them are going to be aware of.

We would prefer a world where they publish these ideas openly so that there's more of a public debate.

Although there is no academic debate about whether the holocaust happened, having academics or leaders in the community come out and speak against holocaust denial, to point out why it's absurd, to be sure that new people are seeing the evidence, ultimately is better than pretending that holocaust denial doesn't exist.

We tell you that the best disinfectant is sunlight, that when you're able to challenge people and force them to think critically about the idea of holocaust denial, they'll realize that it's absurd and that the holocaust happened.

But if nobody's challenging the idea because the public sphere never hears anyone deny the holocaust, then people aren't going to realize that it's a real thing that happened.

They're going to just accept, at face value, the idea that the holocaust is some sort of, I don't really know a lot about this, but like rothschild scheme or whatever these people say.

And ultimately, they're not going to be able to think critically about it.

So in our world, we tell you that when you challenge these ideas, ultimately more people see that they're bad ideas.

We think that debate, funny enough, actually does have educational benefits in terms of making people aware of the truth.

Our next argument is that we want to raise awareness of the holocaust more generally.

Now it's easy for people to think everyone knows about the holocaust, but we're living at a time when the generation that went through this this event is still alive.

We think that in thirty years, when most of those people have passed away, holocaust awareness, in general, is going to be much lower and that, in particular, in countries that don't have large jewish populations, people are likely to focus less on the holocaust as world war two recedes from recent memory into, you know, the more distant past.

We think that it's important that we're able to challenge holocaust denial, because this will increase the level of education about the holocaust more generally.

The allies said in nineteen forty five that they would never forget, but in order for that to be true, we have to keep educating young people about the holocaust.

Fighting holocaust denial provides an impetus to do so.

If you want children to do things like read books like "" night "" in schools, then you need to provide a reason for the public to support them doing that, and fighting against holocaust denial provides such an impetus.

If holocaust denial goes underground and most people never hear about it, then they're more likely to be okay with removing the holocaust from school curricula and then it'll be forgotten, like the armenian genocide, which we think is an unacceptable outcome.

Our third and final argument is that if you criminalize holocaust denial, it's harder to know who is a neo-nazi.

We tell you that, right now, you can identify people who are neo-nazis or fascists or far-right extremists, based on their views on the holocaust.

If people are subscribing to magazines and newspapers that promote holocaust denial, then we can put them on lists of potential members of the far right and things like that.

In this way, we can keep an eye on these people, who pose a very real threat to democracy.

If you criminalize holocaust denial, then these people go underground and we lose sight of them.

They're able to pass as normal people, and they won't be held responsible for their horrible and heinous beliefs.

It'll be more difficult to crack down on them when they commit acts of terror, which by the way the far right commits more acts of terror in america than any other group.

Islamic extremists, whoever you want to think about, they commit more acts of terror than anyone.

So we can better put together an idea of who these networks are and who these people are and how they're spreading their horrible ideologies, when we can track them through tracking holocaust denial materials.

So for these reasons, holocaust denial should not be banned.

Thank you.

"
"will_881_holocaust-denial_con_opening_rachel","881","CON","will","rachel","I'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should criminalize holocaust denial.

Two independent points, first is freedom of speech.

Gov explains to you in their speech that this is essentially something that causes harm using the , you know, shouting fire in a crowded theater type standard.

Well I think that standard makes sense, that speech that causes tangible harm should be restricted.

I think there's a lot of problems with the way in which this standard is then applied to holocaust denial by side government.

The first is that holocaust denial is a simple idea statement.

It is not, you know, an actual call to arms or a call to action.

This is a problem because gov repeatedly insists that there is acts of violence which correlate strongly with holocaust denial, but I don't think this is a sufficient standard for actually abolishing the type of speech.

That just because it correlates and is often associated with violence, doesn't mean that you should, you know, completely restrict the notion is bad, and generally under any sort of, you know, construct of what free speech is and why it matters, expression of ideas and opinions is paramount to its preservation.

But the second is that, you know, when the second standard way in which she applies the standard is to say that there is psychological damage intrinsic to expression of the idea.

Wholly speaking, this is a bad standard for when we should restrict freedom of speech.

Most ideas, most opinions, create some sort of psychological damage.

You know, expression of support for communism probably establishes some level of psychological damage for, you know, people who fled the russian regime.

Expression of support for fascism probably, you know, is it creates that sense of problems for , you know, people who fled the italian regime.

Lots of ideas have really problematic applications for lots of people.

Even if that psychological damage and that, you know, that pain that people feel when it is brought up is extremely real, it is a bad standard to apply universally, because that intrinsically winds up with restrictions on large amounts of speech and opinions.

This limits discourse.

This limits people's right to autonomy and free speech, wholly speaking, and we think this is extremely, extremely problematic.

My second independent point is that underground discourse, which is what happens on their side of the house, is worse than the world in which people openly discuss holocaust denial.

So even if you think that this is something that free speech doesn't protect and it's just an awful idea that people really shouldn't be discussing, I don't think that the policy actually does that.

People still have these conversations but they have them, you know, on things like online chat rooms, or in, you know, dark closed rooms or whatever, like this isn't something that goes away.

This has two impacts.

First is that now it festers in the worst way possible.

People radicalize because there's never question on their beliefs.

These conversations exclusively happen in like literal echo chambers, online locations where there is no voice of opposition expressed and as a result, the belief system coalesces into the anti-semitism that side gov so obviously is trying to avoid.

But secondly, I think that there's less converts to these radical ideas when you have it expressed in a public forum.

The reason for this is that the way in which, you know, radical anti-semitic groups generally recruit their members is through things like, you know, targeting people who feel like they are rejects of society, bringing them into these like closed, you know, like online chambers and things like that, and then subjecting them to the echo chamber where these beliefs are never questioned.

We think when these conversations happen in public though, there is a capacity to, you know, challenge them through the media, through online discourse, through literal interpersonal discourse, and as a result, we think it's much harder for these radical groups to just recruit people, because the beliefs are questioned, because there is that voice of opposition.

And as a result, we think it's much better with this is a frank conversation that we have out in the open rather than allowing, you know, anti-semites to just have these closed-door conversations where they're reinforcing their own ideas and are never questioned.

Proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_881_holocaust-denial_pro_opening","881","PRO","rachel","","The motion for today's debate is that we should that holocaust denial should be a criminal offense.

Two main areas of clash, the first on why this is unprotected speech as per general freedom of speech like laws.

So recognize that we protect speech for most situations except in those where it is incendiary, AKA a cult of violence, or causes significant harm to others.

This is why for example, you cannot yell fire in a crowded theater, because clearly this is a situation in which your free speech causes significant harm to others that impedes their future rights.

Or for another example, why, call to arms, by the communist party were not allowed on fliers because even though it is free speech to be a communist it is not free speech to yell let us demolish the capitalist world through bringing up arms against our brethren.

So recognize that holocaust denial clearly does both.

First, it is often a call to violence against jews because they are seen as those people who unfairly put others in jail because they by faking the holocaust but and this leads to physical violence in and of itself.

So how many times have we seen videos in which neo-nazis assault jews by yelling that they faked the holocaust and use this as an avenue by which they can justify their future violence?

We also think that it causes deep psychological harm to those listening, especially those of jewish descent or survivors of the holocaust, because it invalidates their experiences and says you made this up, you didn't actually experience the pain that you did before.

Recognize that there is also no difference between psychological and physical harm other than the stigma that we have put in society upon it.

Because even when when even our like chemical connections in our brain fire the same way if you are to cut me then if you are to verbally assault me.

We think that at that point they become indistinguishable from each other.

There's also long term physical harm to jewish communities when they are invalidated and broken apart by this kind of speech.

So once we recognize that it is unprotected speech we can then criminalize it off that alone.

But second, let's talk about societal impacts.

Because we think that if you can show if we can show you that there is enough bad harms associated with holocaust denial, then we don't care if it's free speech that ought be protected, it ought be banned based on a utilitarian framework in which we see that the harms outweigh the like principled stance.

So let's talk about damage to jewish communities.

Because when you invalidate a community and cause others to see it is untrustworthy, it means you are taking away first, a lot of the infrastructure that comes in from other communities, but also and like public support, but also psychologically damaging the individuals that compose that community.

You're invalidating survivors' experiences, and it tells families that the losses they experienced are fake.

This is anger that never gets answered on their side of the house when when holocost holocaust deniers get to walk free after actively harming those who have to listen to them.

We think that as with any kind of crime that causes a harm it is only just if they also have to pay the price of a criminal offense.

So if one of these nazis was to come up and stab a member of the jewish community they would necessarily be placed in jail than have to pay like some sort of retributive price on this.

We think that it is no different when they tell someone that they're like that the holocaust is faked insofar as the same kind of harm is caused.

But next we want and finally we want to talk about children.

Because we think that holocaust denial is especially damaging when it is allowed into our schools and allowed to be spouted by teachers.

Very recently there was a scenario in which one a child was allowed to write an entire essay on how the holocaust was fake with sources brought up to verify it.

We think that children are often more impressionable than adults and that in these situations children very well do believe that the holocaust might have been faked.

This creates a long term unsafe and more hateful world in which children are essentially raised with anti-semitism.

Don't let them poison the minds of our youth, we think that it ought be a criminal offense.

For these reasons proud to propose.

"
"tim_881_holocaust-denial_pro_opening","881","PRO","tim","","Holocaust denial should be a criminal offense.

Now obviously in this debate we're not talking about holding beliefs about holocaust denial but rather about propagating or promulgating those beliefs throughout society.

Whether this is publicly saying these things, publishing things that preach these types of ideas etcetera.

We said we would ban and criminalize those types of things.

So first, we think we need to talk about when we restrict speech, because we think we do it all the time the status quo for justifiable reasons.

So firstly, we restrict speech when it is harmful to people's identity.

So this is distinct from speech that simply makes someone feel uncomfortable, or makes someone feel sad, but rather this is speech that directly targets individuals because of an irrevocable or unchangeable aspect of who they are.

So things like hate crimes, things like racist slurs against minority communities in the united states which are criminalize, things like taking action that specifically target minority and discriminated against communities, so we restrict these things in the status quo because we don't think you have a right to spread those types of hated words.

We think the freedom of speech exists in order to ensure that we can have an open marketplace of ideas that allows for increased discourse and increased self expression, but when you when you spread these types of ideas things, like holocaust denial, you raised the experiences of an entire group of people, of the jewish population, and an experience that shaped their identity as a culture that is something that was an attack on their existence and is something that is a turning point in human history and that needs to be recognized.

We think that spreading these types of ideas undermines their identity and and also serves to undermine the marketplace of ideas, the ability for people to express themselves which means that this is an instance in which you can criminalize and therefore restrict speech.

The second reason that we can restrict speech is when it encourages bad social behavior.

So recognized that holocaust denial doesn't exist in a vacuum.

Those that deny the holocaust are also often parts of things neo-nazi and fascist organizations and things that spread and preach anti-semitism.

We think that all of these ideas are unacceptable within our society.

To continue to demonized a group of people no matter what group of people, whether they be minority group or whether they be a jewish community we think is unacceptable within our society.

All these people have the equal right to live a peaceful and prosperous life as anyone else and to and to have holocaust denial and to continue from there to preach things like harm against the jewish people and to because of holocaust denial said that they're liars about these types of things, that there's a vast jewish conspiracy which is what comes along with things like this, we think that that is unacceptable and only breeds more violence against this group of people that has already suffered far too much violence over the course of their history.

So the second reason that we think that we should that in this particular instance we should make holocaust denial a criminal offense is because to deny the holocaust into a race history creates a slippery slope in which we begin to forget the lessons of the holocaust.

We think that the holocaust is a turning point in human history not because it was a genocide but because it was a nearly universally recognized and condemned genocide.

It set an idea of what is unacceptable within a society and we think that to undermine the holocaust by denying its existence undermines the prohibitions that we have as societies on that idea and while genocide has occurred since the holocaust and will likely occur again, we think that mass demonization of the holocaust gives us reason to interfere in and break sovereign states sovereignty and ensure that people are going to be protected and we think that that is of the utmost importance that we do not allow the holocaust or instances of genocide to occur in the future and as this undermines our ability to do that and also violates the entire reason we have freedom of speech by harming other individuals we think that holocaust denial should be a criminal offense.

"
"eitan_926_asean_con_opening_yaar","926","CON","eitan","yaar","Two things in this debate: one, on how blocks bring more power to the region, and two, on how economic dependence between nations is a good thing.

Particularly in an otherwise rather tense region of the world.

A few points of refutation to yaar: before we go to the arguments.

One, yaar starts out with the assumption that this has been tried for years and has failed.

We're not entirely sure where he gets the notion that it's failed.

He goes on to tell you that countries like singapore and malaysia are some of the richest countries in the world.

That's because their GDP has been rising for years that doesn't seem like failure.

Also, these countries haven't had a war between them in years.

Also probably a good thing.

Like, we're not sure what the mark of success yaar is trying to reach is, but it seems that these countries are at least partially doing well.

That may be a marker of success.

Two, yaar says: look, there's no unifying factor.

That's exactly the point.

See yaar never tells you why religion or a type of governance is the form of unifying factor.

What it tells you is in order for countries to care for each other, to cooperate they need a reason.

Something that unifies them.

Crucially, we see no reason why this unifying factor can't be invented.

We think the ASEAN is exactly that unifying factor.

By signing these agreements by signing these accords they are actively creating a unifying factor.

Something that if they win they all win and if they lose they all lose.

This is the way that countries unite together regardless of history.

We think that's a great unifying factor.

Thirdly yaar says there's imbalance in ASEAN.

Some of the countries are rich some of them are poor and that creates tensions.

He's sort of right.

You have to compare to the counter factual.

It's not like outside of ASEAN thailand would've been rich.

They would've been poor and probably would have been substantially poorer.

And it's not like that wouldn't have gone to singapore and malaysia for money and for assistance because they would have needed the assistance.

The only problem is it would have had to re-negotiate that assistance time and time again.

They would've been turned down half the time.

That's the kind of thing that creates uncomfort.

That's the kind of thing that creates tensions between two countries.

So they're right to an extent, the fact that some of the countries are richer and some of the countries are poorer creates tensions, but it's the kind of tensions you get between your older brother and younger brother, not the kind of tensions you get between a poor person and the bank.

And that's what we're trying to keep.

First argument: blocks bring more power.

By uniting in ASEAN they've created more than just an economic agreement.

They've also created a voting block.

This voting block is beneficial to them in more than just ASEAN but also outside of it in places like the UN or in places like WTO.

This is massively beneficial to each and every one of these countries because alone they are very weak in voting power but together they actually have some sort of influence on a global level.

Secondly, economic dependence between nations in a tense region is a very good thing.

If you look at what happens in a lot of the rest of asia there are tensions between countries.

The reason there are tensions between countries is because there's a battle between countries over resources, over land, over geographical areas.

At the point at which you're economically dependent on other nations within the region the likelihood of tensions between those nations drops significantly and that we think is one of the most crucial things that any accords do.

Please continue to support ASEAN.

"
"james_926_asean_con_opening_tim","926","CON","james","tim","We should not disband ASEAN.

So, ASEAN is the association of southeast asian states.

As the last speaker pointed out to you, it's made up of a group of states in southeast asia who are working together towards common goals of development.

Three reasons why we should not disband it.

First is about anti-colonialism.

Recognize that for developing countries like the ones in ASEAN like malaysia, like indonesia, they have a few alternatives for who they can turn to as trade partners.

You have major international trading countries like the states, like china, like EU countries, which historically have treated these countries in a very colonialist way.

Most of the countries in ASEAN except for thailand were once colonized by european countries or the united states, and if you look back before that, they had a semi colonial relationship with china in many instances, such the relationship between vietnam and china.

So we see that there's a history of abuse and mistreatment between these larger countries around the world the more powerful countries, and the ASEAN countries.

We think that by working together, the ASEAN countries can ensure that they are a large enough economic bloc to prevent these major international powers who have historically come in and pushed them around, from dominating the region, in other words, ASEAN makes all of these countries that together are strong and able to resist imperialist aggression or trade policy, and would all individually not be that powerful.

It allows them to work together towards a common goal of independence and it reassures the independence of every member state from international oppression and dependence on one country for trade.

Our second argument, is about why we think that fundamentally ASEAN increases development and that's the highest good in this round.

So first, why is development the most important good?

If you think about the quality of life in ASEAN countries, obviously it varies.

People in malaysia for instance have like a middle income quality of life, people in vietnam are much poorer, but we think that overall everyone in all of these countries could still benefit from more development.

We think that there is a moral imperative for states to seek out development for their citizens.

Why is this so?

So when we say a moral imperative we mean that states always have an obligation to seek this out.

We think that because, any person would always choose to live in the most developed country possible so that they have the highest quality of life, those with the ability to do so, those who reap the benefits of developed life, because they're elites, should try to provide it to everyone else.

To sort of do unto others as you would have them do unto you type of thinking.

We see that, development is more likely with ASEAN.

One, because countries have more access to trade partners and trade goods, so it's more like that they're able to specialize and develop industries that can then take advantage of other markets within ASEAN, and two, because of the access to economic development expertise.

Recognize that many countries in ASEAN, are at different levels of development.

Malaysia is pretty far along, some other countries are not as far along.

So we tell you that people in ASEAN countries can study in other countries and learn about development and industry, and how other countries have been successful in the past, and use this in order to help their own home country.

So at the end of the day, we help the people who are worse off in the world, some of them, some of these very poor people who live in ASEAN countries because we better access development so we shouldn't disband ASEAN.

Our last argument is about peace in the region.

Recognize that there are many potential sources of conflict within the southeast asia region.

Some countries are more closely aligned with china so they see an advantage in china becoming more hegemonic, some countries are more aligned with the united states.

Some countries are communists, some countries are capitalist.

There's been conflict in the past over east timor, and there are other ethnic tensions boiling beneath the surface in many southeast asian countries.

But one of the surest ways to prevent international conflict, is to tie everyone's interests together through trade.

If everyone stands to get richer through peace and poorer through conflict, then it's much less likely that a war will break out in the region.

So for that reason we think ASEAN is a tremendous tool for peace in southeast asia in the future.

So because it's an anti colonial institution, because it promotes development, and because it will lead to peace in the region, we should not disband ASEAN thank you.

"
"yaar_926_asean_pro_opening","926","PRO","yaar","","As much as the concept of creating a super national union for countries to promote the big goals and aims of trade and peace sounds appealing we must face reality and be able to admit when such an organization is failing and is no longer justifying the cost that's invested in it.

This union has been unsuccessful during the decades of its operation to bring about a significant rise either in growth or prosperity of the member countries.

There are several reasons for that: the first one is vast cultural differences.

If we look at the european union as an example for a super national organization that is a relatively successful then we could say that despite the obvious differences in culture there is still a common line between the countries that are like members of of the union.

They are all democratic countries with a capitalist economy, christianity is overwhelmingly the dominant religion in the union and so on.

But when we look at the ASEAN we can clearly see that we are talking about a union between countries with a completely different nature.

Democracies like the philippines alongside monarchies like thailand alongside like military regimes in myanmar, communist regimes in laos or autocratic regimes in singapore.

There is not even one dominant religion.

We have christianity, we have islam, we have buddhism.

So in short we say that it is very difficult to create a true mutual ground, mutual language, this way and like to establish real cooperation.

Second reason is very unstable economies.

If there is anything that we've learned from looking at the difficulties that the european union is facing is that the effect of weak countries on the verge of collapsing like weak member states that are on the verge of collapse or that actually do collapse means trouble for the entire union and it takes huge investments of huge sums of money in attempts to save these member states from bankruptcy.

And with all due respect for the hardship that the greek economy is facing we believe that there is no way to compare it to the economies of countries such as cambodia or thailand that are in much worse shape.

So creating a trade zone between rich countries like singapore and poor countries like thailand or cambodia brings to a complete dependency of the poorer countries upon the richer countries.

This dependency creates conflicts and much resentment even and it might have the opposite effect of what we actually want to achieve on trade on exporting and importing because the relations between the countries are getting tense and so this might have an an negative effect on trade and it might do more harm than good on that respect.

And so it seems that not only the history of this organization teaches us that it's not particularly successful but we also have a few structural reasons to believe that no significant change is seen in the near future.

Maintaining such an organization costs huge sums of money we have to like occupy buildings and pay salaries and conduct summits in signed treaties this is a lot of investment that goes out without achieving anything.

It is a shame basically and so we support the disbanding of the ASEAN

"
"tim_926_asean_pro_opening","926","PRO","tim","","We should disband asean.

In the status quo asean is a system of southeast asian nations organizing into a system that allows for economic progress, growth and trade for the whole region.

It allows for unification between the region in making economic and localized decisions.

We think that both the structure and the pragmatic outcomes of what we've seen from asean are not good, and that it should be disbanded because of that.

Firstly, the structural flaws that make even the concept of this type of union problematic in the way that it currently exists.

Firstly, it ties nations to the economic growth of others, which we think especially in developing countries like those in southeast asia is incredibly problematic, firstly, because these developing nations often have the most tumultruous economies, which means that if one nation goes down, it's likely going to drag down the development of other nations, and secondly, it means that you can't have as much specialization and diversity in in and what these countries are doing when they're all following similar labor standards.

But more importantly, the method of making decisions only through consensus in the asean, which means that any big differences and changes that need to be made to political or economic decisions which are likely to occur in an ever changing world that's based on a technological revolution that is changing what the markets look like on a day to day basis, we think that this type of oaky and saturated system in which every country needs to agree on what is best is only going to hold every country back.

It's going to make them less able to adapt to a changing environment, economic environment in the future, and we think that this only makes these countries more vulnerable to exploitation in the long run.

But the second problem is how asean actually behaves, because in the status quo, asean services a front that allows countries to protect themselves from the human rights and labor abuses that exist.

For example, in the status quo, there are massive human rights abuses in places like myanmar and in other countries in southeast asia, for example, a boat was being sent between two different countries in southeast asia that carried refugees from myanmar in recent in recent months, in which no country was willing to take these people, in which no country was willing to take these people in, and every country created this atmosphere and created an environment in which this type of practice was unacceptable.

Further, actual slaughters and human rights abuses, real murders, real harms are occurring to the people in these countries.

The governments of these of many of these countries are dictatorial in nature, and are impressing the people that exists in these regions.

When these countries close each other off from outsiders and allow for themselves to focus within their own economic sector, their own political sector through the asean, it makes these countries less susceptible to the influences of other voices, moderating force such as the united states and the european union, that may be that may help protect people from these human rights abuses in the status quo.

We think that the best way to protect these people is to disband this network that allows for the protection of abuses as they exist in the status quo, and we think that that is incredibly important, that that is the most important because it ensures that people on the ground, the real people that are impacted by the economic policies of asean, are not being harmed in the process.

And finally, on labor.

Labor practices in these countries are are also incredibly problematic, and it makes it, because these are all a regional area, makes it very difficult for labor to move from nation to nation when the labor standards in each country are so deplorable.

When people aren't able to move out of their country and find better labor standards across the across the border, aren't able to move to any reasonable place to find better labor standards, it allows every country to lower its labor standards, which not only harms the people that exist, but also it decreases the level of productivity in these economies, which has a second secondary negative effect on these countries.

Given that the system of asean itself is horribly bloated, and that the impacts only allow for abuses of the people, we think we should disband asean.

"
"james_986_polygamy_con_opening_tim","986","CON","james","tim","We should not legalize polygamy.

We're going to argue first, that it would be preferable to do away with the institution of marriage entirely rather than to expand it to include polygamy and polyamory, and secondly, that even if you want to maintain the institution of marriage that this doesn't make good legal sense.

So we tell you that ultimately it would simply be preferable to do away with marriage rather than to expand it in this way.

Why?

Marriage is an institution that is founded primarily on coercion.

The history of marriage is essentially that it's important for men to be able to control women in order to assert their own reproductive worth.

To be sure that their children are legitimate.

So marriage as an institution has this kind of sordid history which we think is a good reason to begin questioning it, but that's not enough to ban it in itself.

The reason why it ought be banned is that ultimately marriage preferences, certain lifestyles over others even if you expand it to include polygamy.

At the end of the day, marriage essentially is a government sanctioning for one particular lifestyle.

This may be expanded to include slightly more people as we've seen recently with the legalization of same sex marriage in the US and britain, but ultimately we tell you that it still prioritizes people having long term relationships over short term ones, living with their partner over not cohabitating, and otherwise makes normative judgments about how people ought to live their life.

Tim told you in the last speech that the state should not be in the business of telling people what is right and wrong and how to live their lives when they don't hurt other people.

But by giving legal privileges to people who are married, such as tax breaks, next of kin status, the ability to live together in some countries, etcetera, ultimately you are effectively prioritizing one lifestyle over another.

And we think that this should fundamentally be done away with rather than expanded.

Marriage doesn't become any less problematic just because you include gay people or polygamous people, you're just changing the group of people who are an out group.

At the end of the day, we think that in a world where you banned marriage, people would still be able to claim one another on their taxes, it would just work differently.

People would still be able to get married in the church if they want to, something that's unlikely to be expanded either way.

So if people want marriage for social reasons they can go out and have that without state recognition and we're fine with that.

We just don't think that it's good practice for the state to condone this behavior because implicitly when you do so, you condemn other harmless behavior.

Our second argument is that polygamous marriage doesn't really make sense from a legal perspective.

Realize that from the state's perspective marriage is a contract between two people.

At the end of the day, it's about being able to write someone off on your taxes, it's about being their next of kin, it's about being allowed to share credit cards and other financial vehicles.

The state doesn't really care if you love one another or how you spend your time all it does is allow you to act as a sort of joint person from a legal perspective in certain instances.

All of this kind of works when it's between two people, but at the end of the day this starts to break down when we have larger polygamous relationships.

If you have five people living together and you're allowed to claim them all on your taxes this could allow even very wealthy people to write off almost all of their income because of how the US tax code works.

And there are similar benefits to larger family size in other countries.

I'm not claiming that people are going to run out and have polygamous marriages in order to save money, only to say that existing laws would break down if you allow polygamous marriages.

The tax code and other laws relating to marriage simply weren't designed with this in mind.

The other team is going to say, oh well then change them.

But at that point if we're overhauling huge parts of the legal system, why not go one step further and get rid of this entirely and just allow people to decide if they want to let someone else claim them on their taxes without requiring this archaic institution with its sexist and ultimately problematic roots to continue.

For all these reasons we should not legalize polygamy.

Thank you.

"
"will_986_polygamy_con_opening_james","986","CON","will","james","I'm proud to oppose the motion that we should legalize polygamy.

Our first independent point is that we think that the nuclear family is not only preferable for society at large but also this traditional construct of a two parent nuclear family is better for kids.

So first on society or actually first on kids.

We think that largely the you know the structures that come from raising a child are largely based on one, having sort of like positive role models that you spend a significant portion of your time with but b, having clear delineations and who cares for children.

We think that both of these are significantly more complicated in a polygamous marriage because you believe that at the end of the day.

You know this is something that a, your kid is going to have less time with each individual parent when their time is essentially being spread out more, but also we believe that making those delineations on who spends time with the kid is going to be more complicated with a large set of parents.

That in turn creates the problem of you know essentially you know having your parents and you know have these arguments over who take care takes care of you when.

And of course this happens in two parent structures but we think it's inherently more problematic when there's like more people which enables more buck passing on responsibility.

So this really isn't like a good environment to raise a child in.

But we think that the societal norms stem from the fact that just generally its proliferation which will happen through legalization, we'll get to that moment.

But we think that that proliferation then sort of normalizes it in society in a way that exposes you know more kids to it and as such increases the magnitude of harm.

Our second independent point is that we think the polygamy decreases barriers to the abusive marriage as an institution.

So one hypothetical example of this is say like a group of mobsters who want to avoid testifying against one another, so as such they just like enter a polygamous marriage and as such don't have to testify because they have spousal privilege.

The reason this doesn't happen in the status quo is because you're only allowed to marry one person at a time, so if they're all in their own marriages then like you can't do that.

But if they you know if you have polygamous marriages people can essentially enter and leave marriages as they choose and as they feel free to.

So this creates then a significantly lower barrier to abusing the legal privileges associated with marriage, and as such means that people can you know essentially flop the law and do other you know problematic things like like say taxes for example by you know entering a marriage with one another.

Our third and final independent point is just the abuses that are associated with polygamy.

So we think that but obviously like the big highlighted example is sort of these like more conservative religious groups that often have a lot of like spousal abuse in polygamous relationships.

We think that the proliferation of polygamous relationships will outweigh the legal protections discussed by side government, so that is to say that even if it is easier to be report reviews in each individual polygamous relationship, the fact that there will be more polygamous relationships means that on net there will be more suffering.

We think that the reason why there will be an increase is you know a very simple essentially just that in the status quo even if this is something you're doing behind closed doors there is a risk of penalty that disincentivizes people from doing it.

There's also a social stigma associated with it that reduces the amount of marriages, but we think that both of these go away when you have that government stamp of approval.

But secondly we think that the abuse associated with polygamy is inherent sexism, that this is almost always going to be one man and several women and we think that the presence of this type of marriage and its proliferation in the public eye reifies the notion that women are here simply property of men and that itself as a societal norm is inherently problematic.

Proud to oppose.

"
"james_986_polygamy_pro_opening","986","PRO","james","","We should legalize polygamy.

So, just so everyone's clear what we're talking about in this debate.

We think that in countries where polygamy is currently illegal, such as the united states, britain, canada, that these countries should stop prosecuting people for polygamy, should add it to the books as something legal if they need to do so because of a civil code, or get rid of a law that prevents it if they have common law, all that.

But on top of that, by polygamy we mean the practice of someone taking more than one spouse.

We're okay with this being one husband with many wives, one wife with many husbands, or if that district would otherwise allow it, you could also have same sex polygamists marriages, we're fine with that if it would otherwise be legal in that country.

So yes in the united states, no in germany, for instance.

So, with that in mind, we have three arguments today.

The first is that banning polygamy is tantamount to religious discrimination.

Recognize that the reason why polygamy has been banned in countries like the united states or britain is because there's a strong norm against polygamy in certain christian denominations.

We see that the catholic church, for instance, has preached against polygamy for hundreds and hundreds of years, and that catholic countries overwhelmingly, perhaps all of them, ban polygamy.

We think that first of all, it's unfair for countries to make law based on religious norms.

We think that individuals should be free to choose to follow or not to follow these religious laws.

First of all, if people don't have a real choice about following a religious custom, then they're probably not actually doing anything to fulfill their spiritual obligations, but on top of that we think that, for instance, if you are a muslim living in a predominantly catholic country, you should still be able to practice polygamy because that's acceptable within the confines of your own faith.

A good example of this is why polygamy was banned in the united states.

Some of you may know that mormonism is a religion which originated in america and which encouraged, until very recently, its followers to practice polygamy.

So the united states banned polygamy, and used it as a way to prosecute mormons as a religious minority throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century.

Mormon leaders eventually changed their rules in order to end persecution by the american government.

But we think that this is completely unjust, and that if people wish to practice polygamy due to a certain religious obligation, that they should be free to do so, in the same way that people are free to practice anything else religious that doesn't harm others.

Our second argument is that polygamy is a victimless crime.

In general, we think that government should only intervene in people's personal freedom to limit it, when there are actually going to be third party harms.

We think that, for instance, it's okay to ban smoking because secondhand smoke puts other people at risk of lung cancer.

It's okay to ban theft because you don't have a right to take other people's things.

But we don't see any real harm to polygamy.

Why is this true?

So in order for people to get married they have to enter into a contract, which means that they can't be coerced because presumably they're going to have to go before a judge and say that they weren't coerced, in order to get this marriage contract.

Rules like the minimum age for getting married are still going to exist, so we're not worried about young women being pressured by older men into polygamous marriages, like some people might say would happen.

We think that everyone will have to follow all other existing laws.

So at that point, there's no real harm because people are consenting into this, and it ought be permitted to maximize personal freedom.

Our third argument is that bans on polygamy are unenforceable.

Why is this true?

So in a country like the US, where it has strict laws against polygamy and has had them for over a hundred years, we see that there's still no way to stop people from living in a polygamous fashion.

Lots of people never go down to city hall to get a marriage certificate or whatever you may do in other countries, they just choose to live as husband and wife, treat each other like such.

We see that marriage is predominantly a social and religious phenomenon, and not a government one.

At that point, you can't stop people from having polygamous marriages in a religious or social setting, so there's ultimately no reason to ban it from a legal perspective, because you can't prevent the actions in themselves, only the state recognition of those actions.

So at the end of the day, we think we should legalize polygamy in order to end religious discrimination, because it's a victimless crime, and because the law is unenforceable.

Thank you.

"
"tim_986_polygamy_pro_opening","986","PRO","tim","","We should legalize polygamy.

So, at the very beginning, we want to recognize that polygamy has a connotation associated with it, that is often has to do with the coercion of individuals, specifically women to marry one man, and like a cult situation, or things of this nature.

We just want to say that we believe that, in legalizing polygamy, there are still checks that can be put in place, to ensure that, for example, people that are under a certain age are not able to do this, to ensure that people that are being coerced are not forced into doing this, that you can ensure, as the state, that proper steps are taken to ensure that people are not coerced into doing this.

So, in that respect, we think that it is the fundamental right of people to freely choose to consent into a loving relationship, and that in denying the access to polygamous relationships, and the legitimacy of polygamous relationships, you deny the right to people, consenting adults, to love one another in the way the see fit.

Okay, so first we're gonna talk about laws broadly, and then we're going to talk about why polygamy itself is not problematic.

Okay, so, we think that criminalization should not be based on the enforcement of moral norms, and of particular attitudes.

We think that the reason that polygamy became legal, in the first place, is because there is an association of polygamy with certain bad moral actors, and that as such, individuals felt that they need to enforce their own moral systems onto individuals.

We don't think this is a proper justification for inhibiting someone's freedom.

We think that laws should only be constructed in order to maximize freedom, and what this means is that, laws should be constructed, insofar as if someone is taking action that violates another individual's freedom, that restricts their ability to freely do as they see fit in a meaningful way, we think that it is justified in making such an action illegal, in certain circumstances.

But in the case of polygamy, we see no such way in which a polygamous relationship, or polygamous marriage, in any way undermines the freedom of other individuals.

If I and two other people love each other, and agree that we love each other, and consent to being in that type of relationship, we see no way in which our love has any sort of impact on other individuals.

If there's some sort of emotional repercussions, that other individuals experience, it is not the job of government to ensure, that people are always comfortable with the actions of all other individuals, or otherwise, you would have to criminalize almost every action, that an individual could feasibly take, because someone is going to is going to find those actions repugnant.

We think that polygamy, that love cannot be quantified into a simple idea that one person loves another person, and that love is reciprocal in nature.

We don't think that love can be restrained to traditional marriage ideals, and to the idea that it could only be between two consenting individuals.

We think that love is much more broad than that, and that in criminalizing polygamy in the status quo, we deny that love as legitimate.

We tell people that their relationship is improper, we demonize people, because they have emotional attachments to more than one individual.

We don't think there's any justification for this, insofar as people, who are in these polygamous relationships, do not harm other individuals.

As such, we believe that it is essential that the state does not construct laws on the basis of emotional or moral repugnance, but simply on the basis of ensuring the maximal freedom of its citizenry.

And for these reasons, we believe we should legalize polygamy.

"
"tim_994_hydroelectric-dams_con_opening_yaar","994","CON","tim","yaar","-ot further exploit hydroelectric dams.

So we want to start off this debate by explaining to main principles that we're gonna guide our argumentation around.

The first is that it's important to recognize in this debate that there's a fungible amount of resources available for clean energy development and clean energy technology.

There are only so many investors willing to enter into the green tech market, there's only so many resources available, there's only so many people that are qualified to work in the engineering and in the development of these types of technology.

So when we're talking about whether or not we're going to further exploit hydroelectric dams, we don't think the main comparatives is between this and fossil fuels, but rather between this and other types of green tech such as solar and wind energy.

And the second thing that's important to recognize is that when we're talking about clean energy technology, what's important is not just the fact that we make the transition to green energy tech, but also that we quickly scale up.

Because it's not just a matter of converting, but doing so in a very fast manner, ensuring that the worst climate change impacts don't come to pass, and the only way to do that is by scaling up quickly so that the vast majority of people are on the green energy grid, are using green tech for their energy consumption and their energy needs.

And what's important is that in order to have this type of scale up you can only choose to develop and really invest in one, maybe two types of technology, because you need to put so many of your resources into the investigation, into the engineering, into the further development to make these types of technologies more efficient.

So what we're going to argue is that hydroelectric dams are a less useful form of green energy then specifically solar or wind.

So there are a few reasons why you think that's the case: so firstly, it's important to recognize that hydroelectric dams are nontransferable, and what this means is that while they're useful in some areas where they're possible, in which there's large rivers or other sources of immense amounts of running water, in areas where this isn't the case, areas that are very dry or mountainous or don't have these rivers nearby, this type of technology is not very useful in these areas.

And while you can use this technology for a fairly large grid to power a fairly large grid, it's not going to be enough to sustain many cities on the same grid from the same source.

And so we think that compared to things like solar energy in which you can put a solar panel on basically almost any house in america at this point and you'll be able to get almost enough energy to basically autonomously fuel that house, we think that this is just a much less efficient tool.

Secondly hydroelectric dams come with habitat destruction that other types of energy such a solar energy don't.

When you develop a hydroelectric dam you really interfere with eco systems that are involved and where the dam is being developed.

There's a lot of development that takes place not just for the dam but also in the area surrounding the dam because you need to build the infrastructure that will be able to transport the power, you need to be able to put things in place so that people can work in the area, all of these things harm the ecosystem in these areas whereas other types of green tech are less intrusive.

We think that's just better for the environment, better better goes with the philosophy of green tech.

And finally we would say that other technologies are further ahead.

There's been massive recent investment in solar cells.

There's already an immense amount of infrastructure and development existing in solar cells.

So we think that if we were to transition to solar energy rather than hydroelectric dams as our primary form of green technology, that we would have a much better chance of scaling up quickly and we think there'd be more political will for this scale up.

And what's important to remember is what we explained in the beginning: there are a fungible amount of resources and scale up requires using almost all the resources, if we're going to do it fast enough.

For these reasons we should not further exploit hydroelectric dams.

"
"will_994_hydroelectric-dams_con_opening_james","994","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should further exploit hydroelectric dams.

My first independent point is that hydroelectric dams disrupt the local ecosystem.

Ask of points out there is significant impact on the local environment particularly the river itself generated by the presence of a hydroelectric dam.

The guv example of this is migratory fish but we think it's actually much more profound than that.

We think that specifically the flow rate of an individual river can affect things like whether or not animals can bathe and drink from that whether river we think it shapes the actual landscape down river because river speed determines whether or not it washes up sand in a particular way or it carves out land in a particular way to form a deeper river basin and as such entire ecosystems not just within the river that rely on the river itself to move but also rivers surrounding ecosystem supported by the river such as say like bears or something that live nearby are heavily dependent on a precise flow rate at the river.

We think then that when one introduces a hydroelectric dam this has a profound impact on the ecosystem.

This is important for two reasons.

First we believe that in any damages sustained by wildlife in and of themselves are problematic because we believe that it's important to mitigate animal suffering.

We think that rights are derived largely from whether or not a being has preferences that is to say whether or not it can say that is painful I don't want it to happen to me.

At that point then we think it's important to preserve you know animal life and access to you know good water food that sort of thing to ensure it has a healthy and happy life.

But secondly we think that preserving ecosystems is important even from a human centric position because large amounts of things like that humans derive from the ecosystem are reliant on its stability.

Things like food.

Things like research.

These sorts of things are heavily disrupted when the ecosystem itself is disrupted because even minor changes can cause large chain reactions in food chains and in life support systems like rivers.

Our second independent point is that hydroelectric dams have comparatively lower employment rates than other forms of energy including renewable energy and at that point we think that contrary to government's model we should do you prioritize construction of them.

Energy infrastructures is an important employer largely because of how much staffing it often requires.

Things like say nuclear power plants require a large amount of people constantly staffing it to ensure that you know things don't go wrong.

And we think that's important because it provides people with jobs.

This is of course you know the life blood of any economy is insuring that people have the capital to buy things so that the wheels can keep turning.

Hydroelectric dams have low employment rates though precisely because of the benefits touted by side government that they run more or less automatically and really only need occasional maintenance from high skilled workers.

That's a problem because as compared to something like say nuclear power or like say solar power there isn't a lot of day to day maintenance there isn't a need for a large employment staff and as a result we think that even if energy costs are slightly higher without hydroelectric power there is a significantly higher impact on the broader economy by the lower employment rates generated by this form of technology.

Our third and final independent point is that this is simply an eyesore.

So we think that a lot of rivers particularly run through scenic areas that have both cultural and more tourism related reasons for maintaining their beauty.

Hydroelectric dams are often large unwieldy and not very pleasant to look at and because they're situated on rivers they're often creating an eyesore in the most beautiful part of the landscape we think then that because a there are preferences in the locals to keep these areas looking the way that they look and b there more fiscal reasons tied to things like the tourism industry it's problematic to create large eye sores like this.

Proud to oppose

"
"yaar_994_hydroelectric-dams_pro_opening","994","PRO","yaar","","We should further exploit hydroelectric dams.

It is a fact that using traditional non-renewable sources of energy production like fossil fuels is hugely contributing to climate change and it is a fact that climate change poses a great risk to our entire species.

I doubt that my opponent will try and deny these things because if they choose to do so they are going directly against the strongly held scientific consensus.

The only logical conclusion of both these facts is of course that we as a species must quickly endeavor to make a substantial transition from the way we are used to produce energy and aim to rely much more on renewable energy sources.

There's also the additional little problem with non-renewable energy sources being non-renewable.

Meaning they will eventually end.

This makes prices incredibly unstable in the short term and of course forces us to find alternative renewable solutions anyway in the long term.

So we might as well find them as soon as possible and not be caught with our pants down in the future.

Another reason we must develop alternative energy solutions to fossil fuels has to do with political and economic reasons.

Our great dependence on oil and gas and fuel has made us hugely dependent on countries and regions who were blessed with large reserves of these resources and those just happened to be countries in the persian gulf.

This creates a problem in the west as some of these countries are outright ideological enemies, like iran, and others are problematic non-natural allies, like saudi arabia or qatar, that have fanatic religious regimes and horrid human rights abuses.

Yet we are compelled to overlook those in favor of economic incentives.

Having said all of that, what are our options?

Well basically there's solar power solutions, there's wind power solutions, and there's water power solutions.

We on side government believe that all of all of the above are important directions to pursue and are in no way mutually exclusive.

The most dominant and effective among the water power solutions is of course hydroelectric dams.

Now opposition may talk about how these dams create some environmental harms.

And perhaps that's true but providing enough energy to sustain the modern way of life is a messy business no matter how we look at it.

And when it comes to protecting the environment we need to think in terms of how to minimize the harm since it's just not plausible to completely, entirely avoid it.

So in comparison with using non-renewable energy sources, of course that whatever environmental harms these dams create are almost negligible.

But it's also possible that hydroelectric dams create more harm than using wind turbines, even though I'm not sure that that's the case, or solar panels, again even though I'm not an expert and I don't really know, but it's possible.

And so opposition may want to talk tell you that's the true comparative here are these other renewable sources of energy and that we should further exploit them instead of hydroelectric dams.

But the truth of the matter is that there just isn't enough potential in wind or solar power harnessing to satisfy the massive energy consumption of the modern society.

Hydroelectric dams account for roughly eighty five percent of renewable energy production nowadays.

Which means that it's production capabilities and potential far outweigh the other renewable solutions and so we basically are left with no choice but to further exploit hydroelectric dams.

"
"james_994_hydroelectric-dams_pro_opening","994","PRO","james","","We should further exploit hydroelectric dams.

So, hydroelectric dams are just ordinary dams that produce electricity and by further exploit, we think that countries around the world should seek to build hydroelectric dams preferentially, relative to traditional sources of energy and at a greater rate than they're doing in the status quo.

So, three big arguments for you.

The first is about why we need to transition to renewable energy.

So, the first question there would be: is hydroelectric power renewable?

But we see that rivers will continue to run whether or not we dam them, so it seems very likely that this is a sustainable form of energy in the long term, and it's one that doesn't involve any sort of pollution.

It is true that hydroelectric dams may disrupt the flow of water.

It may be damaging, say, to migratory fish, but we see that there are ways to work around this.

We might disable a hydroelectric power plant during a migration by animals, or we might come up with a way for fish to bypass it.

There're there are these little steps that salmon can jump up they use at some hydroelectric dams up in alaska, for instance.

Scientists are clever.

I'm sure that they'll be able to come up with a workaround here.

We think that it's essential, though, that we transition to green energy to reduce our carbon emissions.

The population is only growing and, particularly, as regions like china and india develop and these people have a higher quality of life, they're going to demand more access to energy.

We need to ensure that that energy is provided in the cleanest way possible, which means building things like hydroelectric dams.

The other great advantage of hydroelectric dams is that you can build them on almost any river in the world.

Wind power only works where you have strong wind currents, so that might be good in massachusetts, but not so good in florida.

And solar power, of course, relies on getting lots of sun which means that as you move further north, it's less and less useful.

Hydroelectric power can be used almost anywhere in the world, so we think that it is the type of green energy that we ought most invest our efforts into.

Our second argument is about energy independence.

Many countries around the world rely on their neighbors for electricity production.

To use a benign example, germany recently closed down lots of nuclear power plants after the fukushima disaster in japan, and now they buy electricity from france, where it's produced by nuclear power plants.

I thought it was a bit funny, but what's important here is that countries can improve on their energy independence through further exploitation of hydroelectric dams.

A country like egypt, for instance, that's built massive dam projects in the past, has reduced their dependence on the international community for energy.

We think that by building hydroelectric dams, you therefore strengthen your own economy because you avoid imports, and you also create skilled jobs in the form of the engineers who would work at these plants and, in addition, you create work in terms of constructing these hydroelectric dams, etcetera.

We think that it would be a stimulus for the economy.

And our last argument is that we think that it is a wasted opportunity when rivers flow undammed.

Recognize that the energy that a river contains when it flows to the sea is being spent one way or the other.

If you build a hydroelectric dam, then that energy can go to powering hospitals and schools and houses.

And if you don't, then that energy goes to pushing some sand around at the bottom of an estuary.

We think that it's important that we don't waste energy.

It's a finite resource, however much of it that there may be in nature.

Given that our potential to spend energy in the future is going to grow exponentially it seems, it has certainly grown exponentially since the beginning of the nineteenth century, we think that we need to take every effort now to harness as much of the earth's energy as possible so that future people may have a higher quality of life and a better standard of living and that, ultimately, it would be a wasted opportunity not to further exploit these hydroelectric dams.

So because it's a good form of green energy, because it promotes energy independence, and because not to do so would be a wasted opportunity, we should further exploit hydroelectric dams.

Thank you.

"
"will_1103_anti-social_con_opening_james","1103","CON","will","james","I'm proud to oppose the motion that we should abolish the anti social behavioral disorders.

So broadly our you know concern here is that we decrease anti social behavior.

We think that anti social behavior is particularly problematic because unlike most other types of criminal offenses which are you know very clear cut you know like robbing a store for example is like it's pretty clear to define what constitutes robbing a store antisocial behavior is much harder to pin down and as such it's harder to crack down upon with the type of like legal constraints and protections that government is discussing.

None the less we still think it has profound impacts.

Something like for example being a nuisance in a public square has a pretty tangible impact on a lot of the people that are occupying that public space.

You know playing your music really loud has an effect on your neighbors both in terms of the irritation it generates but also in terms of their ability to sleep things like that.

So we think that criminal law should be concerned principally with mitigating damage upon innocent people and preventing them from experiencing harm even if the harm is somewhat minimal.

At that point then we think that anti social behavioral disorders are uniquely equipped to deal with that.

Three independent points pertaining to the mechanisms by which the anti social behavioral disorders mitigate the proliferation of anti social behavior.

First is that it acts as a deterrent so we think that oftentimes people who are going to engage in particular behaviors do so on a cost benefit analysis.

If I'm going to rob a store for example I'm less likely to do it if I you know fear that I'm going to be penalized for it.

I think that robbery would be much more common if it wasn't a crime.

Likewise with even you know smaller offenses that presumably bring even less benefit to the individual person there is a significant deterrent created by a potential looming penalty that is to say that you know I might really like sitting out on my porch and playing music off my gramophone loudly but I'm way less likely to do it if there's actually like a criminal penalty for doing so.

So we think that laws like this create a significant capacity for people to say oh I'm not going to do that because there's like this ridiculous fine or this ridiculous penalty that might be levied against me if I do so.

Secondly we think that the anti social behavioral disorders are more adaptable than typical criminal law.

So specifically government takes issue with the broadness of these laws but we think that that's good because of how difficult antisocial behavior is to pin down.

A lot of the time the specific action that creates a nuisance is different and as such it's hard to create a consistent law passed by the legislature in a timely fashion that appropriately responds to these public nuisances.

We think having a broadly applicable and sort of like adaptable flexible law is good to ensure that we actually have the capacity in the legal infrastructure to crackdown on these behaviors.

Absent that flexibility we think that law enforcement is just going to be inherently poor more poorly equipped to deal with anti social behavior.

And our third point is that these orders are you know just good at blocking people from doing these things.

A lot of the time antisocial behavior is often conducted by a specific group of people so the gramophones thing is often done by more elderly people like this is the typical example for when the anti social behavioral orders are like often implemented.

And because you have the capacity to in a criminal court basically put a restraining order on the activity prevent people from doing it we think that that then increases you know the ability to stop people from doing it because you could actually put you know a specific legal document down saying you can't do this anymore so that ensures that the harm generated by set action occurs less frequently.

Proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_1103_anti-social_con_opening_tim","1103","CON","yaar","tim","Two points in the speech: first, a principle justification for ASBO's and second, why these laws are necessary to protect citizens from actual harm.

Before that, a few points of refutation to the previous speaker.

So he starts by saying that the law is meant to protect freedoms and that ASBO's harm freedom.

Why?

Because in their mind there is no actual harm here, this is just behavior that bothers people.

So we don't understand on what grounds they separate here between something that bothers people and harm.

If we're talking, for instance, about a neighbor that insists on playing his music really really loud then this is harassment.

Plain and simple.

This is an actual harm for all we know.

Then they say that the law mustn't interfere with social behavior.

Antisocial behavior, in their minds, is a problem like it's a failure of society and therefore it's society's responsibility to intervene.

Well we have two answers here: first being like violent criminal offenses are often a result of failures of society as well.

So according to this logic we must also let society handle armed robbers that came from a poor background rather rather than legally intervene.

We think that this is crazy.

Secondly, we're going to explain in our positive point why we think that society simply cannot handle this issue well.

So the second point that comes in their speech is that these laws are very vague.

It's unclear to me when am I like breaking the law or not.

We would say that this is imprecise.

We would remind you that there are two stages to this process.

Firstly I get the ASBO after I demonstrated some antisocial behavior and only then if I break it I I break the law.

So it's true that there's a certain amount of vagueness as to when such an ASBO might be issued to me, but up until that point I haven't done anything illegal and therefore there's like no problem of the law being unclear here.

In the ASBO itself, things will be very clearly defined.

And so I could know exactly how I must behave in order not to break the law.

Let's move over to the positive.

So a principle justification.

So right in the end of the previous speaker's speech he says something about people needing to have a mens rea, an ill intention, in order to break the law.

But that is also not precisely the case.

We say that there are some laws that don't require a malign intent, namely negligence laws, and we think that this is very similar to this case.

We're going to justify ASBO's as something akin to negligence.

In cases of negligence you can be criminally liable for your actions because you failed to meet the standard that society, or the court for that matter, define as the standard of the reasonable person.

So in this case as well like in in our case as well we we think that there are there's a certain type of behavior that we can expect people to reasonably follow and whoever fails to do that, by the same logic, can be held liable.

Moreover we think that in many cases there is malign intent in the cases of ASBO's.

It's not hard to imagine people that are just simply jackasses and that they raise the volume up to spite their neighbors.

So there's mens rea, there's actus reus, and there's no problem of of like holding them liable.

Which brings me to my final point: these laws are necessary in order to protect citizens from harm.

Why?

Because we say that we can't just expect society to pass on manners to people successfully like the the previous speaker wants.

As long as there is no significant sanction then the bully has nothing to be afraid of.

If I'm antisocial and I don't care what people think about me which is the only sanction that society knows to to like give you, like that other people won't like you, but if I am antisocial I don't care what other people think about me so I have no incentive and nothing to stop me from bothering other people.

And therefore we need the law to give teeth to this ban and deter people from doing this.

For all these reasons please oppose.

"
"tim_1103_anti-social_pro_opening","1103","PRO","tim","","We should abolish antisocial behavior orders.

Antisocial behavior orders are orders that courts are able to pass upon individuals in torts in which individuals that express what are known as antisocial behaviors, are broadly behaviors that go outside of social norms.

That these individuals can be both publicly shamed and it ensures that these individuals in certain cases can be prohibited from behaving in these ways.

This can be anything from breaking local ordinances about sound, to how you behave in a public group and using vulgar language things like this.

Things that go outside norms of of society.

So we think there are two reasons why we should abolish ASBOs.

The first is that laws should exist to protect freedom and we think that this goes directly against that claim.

Firstly, we think that society is structured in such a way where individuals are not meaningfully able to opt into the society and the legal system they're born into.

Individuals are often born in the country where they'll spend their entire lives and never have a choice over where they were born.

They're bred within that society to live within that society's laws and the individual has very little control over the laws in which they're governed by.

So even if this the vast majority of individuals don't get to have a stand in how they make use laws outside of you know moderately through voting.

They don't have a stance over how these laws are enforced, and they don't a stance over who is making these laws.

So in this way we think that law law by the state is should only exist in order to protect freedom, because as individuals exist within the state it is already an immense burden upon their personal freedom.

It already prohibits them without their consent from expressing that freedom and therefore in order to make sure that that state is just and those laws are just, those laws should only reflect necessary restraints that ensure that freedom is maximized for the whole.

So we think that these things simply do not fall under that.

We think that individuals who express antisocial behaviors who are not doing things broadly that are going to prohibit other individuals from pursuing their freedom, they may be things that irk other individuals, they may be things that are bothersome to certain people.

But we think that teaching social behavior and social norms is not the job of laws.

It's the job of society.

It's the job of the community in which people are raised.

And even if someone is doing something that may be perceived as a nuisance one, this doesn't this doesn't mean that that is necessarily warranting some sort of punishment or public shaming, and two, it means that the society has failed in other steps.

It means that that society has failed in properly teaching these individuals these social norms.

So the second problem that we have with antisocial behaviors is even if you don't think that the law itself is necessarily bad, that it's banning things that are necessarily bad.

We think the way the law exists now is not acceptable.

So the way that the law exists now has very little clarity which we think is necessary in order for people to have a just law.

What we mean by this is that antisocial behaviors are understood very broadly so these don't have certain particular behaviors with tied punishments to them, which means that people can't be fully knowledgeable that they're breaking the law when they do it.

You can't know that you're violating an anti social behavior order because the laws that determine what these things are are largely discretionary and up to judgments of courts and groups like this because this is the case we don't think that this law can be fair.

If one does not have men's rare or the understanding that when they're committing an act it is one that is with ill intent and against the law, we don't think that it's fair that those people can be punished.

If you never knew that such an action could plausibly result in the punishment that you are facing, we don't think it's fair of society to push that punishment.

So even if you were to have these type of antisocial behavior orders we think it would be preferable to have a system of laws that reflect very specific behaviors and very specific prohibitions.

So either way even if you believe that these anti social behavior orders are good in theory that it restricts actions in a positive way they need to be done in an entirely different manner but further, we don't think that these justifications are true.

We don't think these prohibitions are fair and for this reason we should abolish antisocial behavior orders.

"
"james_1103_anti-social_pro_opening","1103","PRO","james","","We should abolish the antisocial behavior orders.

So these antisocial behavior orders are a facet of british law basically in which someone can be banned from doing a certain act that's causing trouble in the community.

So maybe if they're harassing somebody or if they're causing a lot of loud noise late at night things like that, one of these antisocial behavior orders can be issued by a civil court, which would then prevent the person from continuing that behavior and then if they breach that order it works a little bit like a restraining order in that there would be various penalties that would follow from that breach.

So with this in mind, we have two main arguments for why we should abolish these antisocial behavior orders.

The first is that criminal penalties ought not follow from civil court rulings.

What do we mean by this?

So britain is a common law country, which means that criminal law and civil law are conducted separately by separate courts.

So in a criminal court the balance of evidence is beyond the shadow of a doubt.

So you have to go completely beyond any reasonable doubt in order to convict someone in a criminal court, whereas in a civil court the balance of evidence is fifty percent.

So if you can prove that someone is fifty one percent likely to have been guilty then you can get them in a civil court.

So these antisocial behavior orders are issued by civil courts which means that the balance of evidence is fifty one percent for the whoever is bringing the charge, but these antisocial behavior orders also can carry criminal penalties.

People can run the risk of very serious financial penalties or long periods of public service etcetera if they violate these orders.

So what that means is that punishments which normally would have a very high standard of evidence to actually be carried out against somebody are now being carried out with a much lower standard of evidence.

We think that that is fundamentally unjust.

That when the court system was set up with this very high standard of evidence for criminal punishments, it's because these are very severe punishments and we need to be sure that people are actually guilty before we carry them out against them.

But these antisocial behavior orders essentially allow people to convict anybody that they think is probably guilty and then carry out the harshest punishments possible in british society.

At that point we think that it's very likely that many innocent people are going to suffer from these harsher penalties because the standard for proof is so low.

We think that this is fundamentally unjust, that it blurs the lines between criminal law and civil law and that therefore it ought to be abolished.

Our second argument is an argument against vagueness in the law.

We think that fundamentally these antisocial behavior orders can be construed to ban almost any sort of behavior and we don't think that you should have a law be this broad.

It's certainly true that we don't want people to harass one another but we already have laws against that in every country in the world including britain.

In the same way we see that it's probably not good for people to make lots of noise at certain times of day, but again lots of cities have municipal codes that prevent that.

We think that there are better ways to deal with the problems that these antisocial behavior orders address which are much clearer.

We think it's important that people understand what the law is before they can be charged with breaking the law.

It's very likely the case that everyone knows that what they're doing is wrong if they're going to run up against an antisocial behavior order, but whether something is right or wrong is a distinct issue from whether or not it's legal.

We think that it should be crystal clear to every citizen exactly what is permitted, what is forbidden, and what the penalties are for forbidden behavior otherwise we run the risk of holding different people to different standards such as punishing perhaps people of color at a harsher rate than white people, for instance.

We think that any time you allow vagueness into the law you allow more bias on behalf of judges and ultimately that this will undermine the justice system as a fair way to deliver punishment.

So for these two reasons we should abolish the antisocial behavior orders.

Thank you.

"
"yaar_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_opening_daniel","1161","CON","yaar","daniel","We believe that banning cosmetic surgeries harm both the principle of autonomy over one's body and people's identities.

But first of all we think that we should distinguish cases of true deformities or, for instance, procedures that are meant to restore one's previous looks after he suffered an injury that resulted in some deformities.

Side government doesn't say anything to that effect.

All they talk about is botox and like breast enhancement surgeries.

Obviously we think that that is a huge impact in the debate and a huge harm that they do not address at all.

Moving on.

They talk about how cosmetic surgery enhances the model of beauty in all of its harms to society.

We wonder therefore are they also in favor of banning make up, high heels?

What about liposuction surgeries?

What about going to the dentist to make your teeth whiter?

What about tattoos?

We say that all of these examples are also like following from the logic of the analysis of side government.

Moreover they talk about the financial costs and how not everyone can afford it and those who do who are able to afford it need to spend a fortune on it.

Obviously this is true to so many things that it would be impossible to even count.

People spend a fortune on designer clothes, on fancy cars, in ways that don't make any sense, other like but for the fact that this is some sort some sort of like a status that gives them like social capital.

Now that too is is based on social norms that aren't necessarily rational but we do not think that the government can even imagine saying that because this is expensive and some people can't afford this this is a good enough reason in order to ban access to all of these things all together.

Onto the constructive: we say that even if there is truth to the ideal of the government, they have to explain, they have the burden to explain why they think that it's legitimate to force a lot of people to suffer through a miserable life in which they feel very much uncomfortable in their own skins in order to serve this ideal.

Say that I was born with the disfigurement of some sort, that makes me ashamed or insecure, now even if in a perfect world this shouldn't have bothered me.

The fact is that we don't live in a perfect world and the government doesn't really give us any type of convincing mechanism to believe that in a world without cosmetic surgeries this thing is going to change drastically and that people would stop judging each other according like based on how they look.

So why should I pay the price for that?

It's not my fault.

We say that a person's look is a and like a very basic element in his identity.

It's out in the open, it's the first thing that people notice about you.

Whether we like it or not, our appearance deeply affects our life.

The options that we're going to have, the type of connections that we're going to make with other people, now it can be argued that this has become too extreme because of the model of beauty but that's a reality that is unlikely going to change because people are just programmed by nature to be attracted to or to be like not attracted to people based on their appearance.

For all of these reasons we say that most people are concerned about how they look and they want to look as good as they can.

So we say that when a person is unhappy with a certain feature of his appearance this can massively harm his his like feeling of self worth and self confidence.

You feel trapped in your own body and there's no escape.

This is a feeling of shame that escorts you everywhere you go even when you are alone.

Every mirror becomes your enemy.

In fact we say that it's kind of like people that that feel that they were born to the wrong sex and the government wants to force them to continue on living this way even though a solution is available.

Is the solution perfect?

Are there no problems with it?

Obviously no.

It's a debate.

But deciding for these people that are interested in it that the cost is too high for them is just incredibly patronizing and not something that side government can simply decide.

For all these reasons we beg you to oppose.

"
"rachel_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_opening_will","1161","CON","rachel","will","When will argues against cosmetic surgery, what he doesn't seem to understand is that societal standards are going to exist on both sides of the house and will get met either way.

If I'm not spending that money on changing my waist cosmetically I am wearing a binder or a corset that is a lot more physically damaging to me, oftentimes cost just as much, and I am still meeting the same beauty stereotypes.

Women who have too much money for their own good and hate their bodies are going to find a way to satisfy those standards regardless.

What this round is about is whether or not they ought be able to choose the method by which they do so and whether paternalism is justified.

We tell you that we prefer a safer way but more than that that it is still a woman's right to model herself in the male gaze even if it is something that is bad for society writ large.

We think this is about the individual woman's choice and what empowers her not about societal reaction.

Two main areas of clash.

The first on the standards of a ban.

It is generally accepted that a democratic government can ban something if there is either a large personal harm that requires paternalism or if large third party harm that allows you to paternalize an individual's choices.

Will says but society and the reinforcement of stereotypes.

The problem with this is that as we told you, these beauty standards are already there.

At most, there is a marginal reinforcement when the top one percent meets them with cosmetic surgery.

We think the vast majority of people are still not doing it in order to look the way the men want or they like if only because they simply do not have the money to do so.

On a personal level, will did not address any problems and we tell you that this is because there aren't any.

Complications are rare but the esteem boost that women who make these decisions get is very real.

It's not a harm but rather a benefit to take a feature that you have disliked your entire life and turn it into something that is pleasurable and that empowers you.

But then will says it's such a useless expenditure.

All we say to this is that you ought allow an individual to decide what is a useless expenditure.

This is honestly a very dumb argument given that even in the example of a handbag, most of that money still goes to a corporation.

Moreover, who cares?

We recognize that money is the property of an individual and do not paternalize the way in which it is spent because the standards for what is a useful expenditure versus not differs depending on who is looking at the expenditure.

For some, paying for a pet is a useless expenditure given that that pet is not utile to them but for others, it is a very good expenditure because they gain a lot from having that pet.

Cosmetic surgery is no different.

Are second area of clash has to do with cosmetic surgery as a form of empowerment.

We think it is difficult to feel powerful if you're not feeling physically empowered and so it is good to allow women and men to empower themselves in a way that is safe and legal and within their own like power right?

Like we think that it is good that if they hate a future for the majority of their lives they can do something that will fix it and then not hate hate themselves as much or feel more confident in the bedroom.

We think that even if it is like marginally problematic that women get get get like adjustments to their labia because they're told that long labias are bad, we think you still net positive that they then feel more confident in the bedroom and more confident with their own bodies so that they can actually be intimate with another person.

More than this, we tell you it's not always beauty standard based.

Sometimes it has to do with the way that someone feels their face is asymmetrical or in situations of trans-individuals, where they want to appear more like the gender with which they identify.

We think at the point that cosmetic surgery represents very real ways by which individuals can make themselves feel better and empower themselves to be more productive and happier individuals in the long term you ought not ban it.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"daniel_1161_cosmetic-surgery_pro_opening","1161","PRO","daniel","","We should ban cosmetic surgery because of the impact that it has on people's emotional health and the financial costs that it imposes on people as well.

So in order to show why we think that these harms are likely to be realized, we're going to first talk to you about how legalized cosmetic surgery leads to an culture in which cosmetic surgery is glorified, and it creates false ideals of beauty, and that ultimately this is what leads to those harms.

So how do we so how does cosmetic surgery do this.

So we would say that cosmetic surgery oftentimes leads to people changing their body in ways that they otherwise shouldn't.

Whether it's models that are like are plastered around on advertisements to look in a certain way, or advertisements that say that you can look better if you get something like a botox or a breast or a breast augmentation surgery.

We believe that these kinds of procedures are what leads to an entire culture where ultimately this is the expectation for how you should look.

And we believe it is when the a when a culture creates this kind of an expectation for beauty, it means that cosmetic surgery oftentimes is something that people feel pressured into getting, something that they feel that they must get in order to feel wanted, attracted or lovable.

So why do we think that this is harmful for people's emotional health.

Because first and foremost quite simply, this means that most people are not going to be able to meet a societal ideal of beauty without engaging in these cosmetic surgery.

This means that in order for people to feel comfortable in their own skin, they have to go and pay for a procedure.

That's obviously something that is not good and something that we shouldn't encourage within a society.

But additionally we think that since oftentimes a whole lot of people aren't going to be able to access cosmetic surgery, whether it's for economic reasons, or parental consent reasons, or simply not knowing how to do it, or being afraid of the procedure altogether, this means that a whole lot of people are going to have a low sense of self esteem and a lower sense of self worth, because they're not going to feel like they look the same as people in advertisements, or look like the prettiest people at school, or the most attractive people who are going to look these kinds of ways.

So why do we think that this is incredibly problematic.

Given that there is honestly a higher prevalence then in a lot of cases for things like depression or other forms of mental illness, we would say that it's incredibly important to make sure that we encourage people to have a healthier outlook on their body and a higher sense of self worth.

But this is something that is directly discouraged by a world in which cosmetic surgery is legalized.

And the next thing that I want to talk about under this, finally is about the financial cost that this is often going to impose on people.

What do we mean by this?

So I already talked about how cosmetic surgery leads to a culture in which you're likely going to see people want to pursue this for in order to look better.

This is problematic because we think that in a lot of ways these procedures can be quite expensive, they can run up margined cost margins of thousands of dollars.

So when people are coerced into spending thousands of dollars on frivolous nonsense, they obviously have less money for other things as well, things that be could be quite important for them like food, support, or other things that can make them happy overall, like vacation time.

But we also think that this is quite bad in general, because what this is essentially amounting to is society coercing people in a way so they would'nt spend this money otherwise.

Something I think is a real problem.

So the final thing that I want to talk about is about how this uniquely harms poor people.

Because we think that oftentimes there's a lot of negative stereotypes that fall around poor people, like in america for example poor people are often seen if there in a racialized sense, poor people who are minorities are often seen as more hyper sexualized or more unattractive in certain ways, while poor white people are often made fun of for things like missing teeth or likes like that.

We would say that oftentimes this is in many ways contributing to a buyer culture in which cosmetic surgery exists, and the expectations that you're going to look a certain way.

And we think that in a lot of ways this creates a distain for certain groups of people in society, a distain which can also ultimately drive policies that we see of far greater importance.

So it is for all of those reasons we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery.

"
"will_1161_cosmetic-surgery_pro_opening","1161","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban cosmetic surgery.

So first the model.

We wouldn't ban things that are medically necessary or like reconstructive surgery.

So for example, if you were to get into a car crash, we're not and half of your faces is sheared off, we're not going to say that you can't get reconstructive surgery to fix that issue.

Likewise, if you need skin grafts to deal with some sort of life threatening injury, again, we are not going to say that you are not allowed to get that.

When we say cosmetic surgery we mean strictly for non medical purposes.

That is someone is like I think my nose is too big I want it to be smaller.

Things like that.

The implementation method for the government is maybe not totally clear here, but I think generally we're willing to just let the government have a bit of a sniff test on what does and does not constitute cosmetic.

So two independent points under this then: first, is that societal beauty standards are generally enforced through cosmetic surgery, and we deem these standards to be problematic.

And the second is that the expenditures that are made in the cosmetic surgery industry are wasteful spending and damage the economy as a result of it.

On the first point, that societal beauty standards are a problem.

So I think generally speaking it is an uncontroversial point to say that it is bad when there is like this socially defined idea of what does and does not constitute beauty.

There's a good episode of the twilight zone that talks about this.

How basically all of these things are inherently arbitrary.

That our notion of what constitutes being attractive, is in and of itself ridiculous and not actually based on any sort of objectivity.

I think a good example of this is actually just the fact that these standards were totally different a couple of decades ago.

The problem then is that cosmetic surgery enforces these things.

So on the arbitrariness that alone is a reason why this is bad.

But additionally we would say that these are things that are enforced through sexist structures, that generally speaking it is men decide what they find to be attractive and then women modeling themselves in that image.

So we think that the existence of cosmetic surgery is a multi-billion dollar industry designed to enforce patriarchal structures.

That if you were to ban it, it would be tougher to enforce the societal beauty standards and it would be more difficult for men to have this world where they simply model women to their liking.

On the second point, that the industry itself represents large amounts of wasted money.

I think it's pretty fair to say that this is a useless expenditure.

That generally speaking the things that we get out of spending this money are very like short term gains that even the best surgeons in the world can generally not do much that would combat like the ravages of age and in the long term these things probably aren't going to hold too much water.

So the alternatives though, to this sort of like luxury spending, are things that generate growth to a much larger extent than this does, right?

Like if I decide I want like a nose job and I'm gonna spend a couple like a million dollars on that or whatever, all that money just goes into the pocket of like this one doctor.

If I decide I want to spend a billion dollars on some other absurd thing, like a handbag or whatever, or like a really nice handbag I guess, at least that money is in some capacity going to like workers that were in the factory where this thing was made.

Like multiple people involved in this industry.

There is some amount of wealth being spread around through that industry that doesn't happen with plastic surgery.

Because you're spending so much money on a thing that only benefits people who are already very wealthy.

We prefer then the world where you ban this and then that luxury spending goes to things that at least have some sort of multiplier effect.

Proud to oppose.

"
"will_1187_cannabis_con_opening_daniel","1187","CON","will","daniel","I'm proud to stand in opposition of today's motion, that we should legalize cannabis for recreational purposes.

So, I think two independent arguments, sorry.

First is that there are medical harms intrinsic to usage of recreational marijuana, and that there's a significant government interest in combating the proliferation of those medical arms, and secondly, that it distorts the medical industry from a financial perspective, that means that, people who need this medically, that is the people who for which you usage is most legitimate, are the ones who disproportionately suffer under this policy.

So on the first argument, that there are medical harms intrinsic to recreational use.

I think this there's a couple of ways this plays out.

So, cognitive harms, for example, like there are tons of studies out there, that demonstrate that there's very damage in terms of long term memory, short term memory, brain cell generation, all sorts of issues, that are intrinsic to to repeated use.

But secondly, that these harms are disproportionately internalized by children, that when you have a developing brain, this is something that is, you know, more likely to happen.

So, and also beyond this, there is like very little access to information regarding these harms, but I'll get into that in a moment.

So, why is the government justified, then, in restricting on this basis?

Five reasons.

First, you just decrease net suffering, right?

Like, if there is a medical harm, that is intrinsic to the usage of the item, that less people suffer when less people use it.

I think it is intuitively true, that the recreational market means more usage happens, because illegality is actually a barrier to purchasing, like when someone makes that calculus in deciding, am I going to smoke this or not, am I going to go out and buy this or not, generally speaking, it it's more likely that person will decide no, if there is a risk of like arrest, or a fine, or something, if they do so.

Secondly, consent is not always meaningful into doing this.

This is because there is like less imperfect access to information regarding the harms of the item.

Even under a legal structure, I think tobacco is a good example of this, where there is usually this like meaningful distortion of facts by the industry producing the good.

Third is that there are sometimes externalities to this usage, that are not just medical.

So I think a good example of this is stoned driving, where people who didn't consent into the consumption of the item, people that are just innocent bystanders, have to internalize the harms that are intrinsic to the consumption of the item.

Forth is public health costs.

So, insurance is a good example of something that happens, right?

When this is a legal item, insurance companies, under you know, things like pre existing condition laws, and like right to choose laws, and things like that, cannot deny people coverage on the basis that they smoke pot.

That's important, because it means that premiums go up, because there are more things that insurance companies have to solve for, when you have to internalize the harms that are created on the public health network, by the people who are smoking pot, and disproportionately likely to have medical complications.

Society at large has to bear those burdens, because of the increased premiums, you have to get the money from somewhere.

And fifth, is that it is a gateway drug.

I think gov tries to preempt this, by being like: the black market has more gateway opportunities, because of the nature of the transaction.

I think you can just weigh this out with the scope of consumption, that more people smoke on their side of the house, as a result, you get more gateway activity on their side of the house.

My second independent argument is that it distorts the medical industry, because there's now a financial incentive to pump money into researching recreational strains of marijuana, because the payoff is bigger.

I think is intuitively true, like there are generally going to be people that like, generally, the market of people that would consume on a recreational basis is larger than the medical industry, so there's a financial incentive to prioritize the recreational industry.

That's a problem, because that research is zero sum.

So, it's always going to come at the expense of the people that need it for medical purposes, and we should always prioritize the people that need access to this substance the most, at the highest rate.

Proud to oppose.

"
"sam_1187_cannabis_con_opening_will","1187","CON","sam","will","I stand in firm opposition to the motion cannabis should be legalized.

I have two arguments for why cannabis should not be legalized, but first I have a few overviews to address some of will's arguments.

First off on crime and dessert.

When individuals commit a crime they are taking an action against society.

We've elected politicians, we have voted in favor of laws which say that the consumption of cannabis ought to be illegal.

Because the good and rights are idiosyncratic and determined by the society in which actions are taking place, when individuals take actions in opposition to the rules of law they are essentially saying that your interpretation of the good is fundamentally incorrect.

That they ought be outside the law when it is best for them.

We think that individuals who have harms against them after breaking the law do not deserve additional protections from government.

We would say that if illegal guns were on average more dangerous than legal guns, there'd be no reason that the government should expand gun access to individuals who would otherwise be prevented from buying a legal gun.

We think that once individuals have consented to the harms of a legal action by ignoring the rule of law they ought get what is coming to them.

Secondly, I want to say about the idea of oppression and racism.

Cops will always find a reason to oppress black bodies, oppressed black individuals, just look to philando castile.

He literally followed the instructions of the cop to the letter.

He said exactly what he needed to, he admitted he had a gun in the car, as gun rights activists say you ought to do when dealing with a cop, and he was shot until he was dead.

What this means is that the problem of racism is not a problem of any individual policy.

It must be solved through overall broad societal change and a fundamental restructuring of the police system.

Allowing cannabis will not solve this.

We see this in states like oregon, washington, and alaska.

They these states have already had investigations by the department of justice but continue to be racist as it is essentially a symptom of the police system.

Legalizing pot, legalizing cannabis, will not solve this.

Two arguments for why legalizing cannabis is a bad idea.

First off, on international implications.

The united states has pushed its ideas and pushed its policy on the world at large.

States have adopted strong anti-drug policies as a result of the united states influence.

And now it has been pushed into the rule of law in those states and been determined to be the societal good as I discussed in my overview.

What this means is that if the united states abandons this policy, abandons the states which itself has pushed to adopt certain policies, then these states will be massively harmed.

These states depend on united states support, both philosophically and in a lot of cases financially, to stop the usage of drugs and the united states abanding them abandoning them now would be fundamentally unjust.

On cartels, I would like to discuss the idea that cartels will shift to another option, another product, if we legalize coke er excuse me not cocaine cannabis.

They could they could start to sell hard drugs more often, move to things like human trafficking, both of these are terrible options that are far more likely if the cartel has no other option.

The cartel has huge infrastructure put in place to smuggle goods into the united states and will continue these paths even if cannabis is legalized.

As such we should allow them to continue selling cannabis rather than shifting to a more problematic product.

The second argument is about efficiency and happiness.

Autonomy is threatened by cannabis.

When individual smoke their motivation goes down, typically their memory is harmed, this is huge externalities as it can harm the people around you.

Driving under the influence can make it more likely that you'll kill someone, but additionally we believe we can regulate or individual action.

When individuals are told they must wear a helmet or face fines, that is us saying that profoundly illogical individual actions ought be regulated by government.

We think it is both philosophically consistent and essential that government legislate this sort of action and as such cannabis should not be legalized.

"
"will_1187_cannabis_pro_opening","1187","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition for today's motion that cannabis should be legalized.

Three independent points: first, that it is a paternalistic policy to ban people from engaging in consensual actions, second, that legalization will decrease the power and the harms of black markets, and third, that implementation in the status quo has racist undertones.

First on paternalism.

It's important to recognize that, autonomy is a good in and of itself, that it is the fundamental right that we derive all others from.

The reason that we care about, for example, our right to life, is because we have the ability to do things with that life, so, going off of that, them, it's important that the baseline, that we attribute all policies by, is: does this allow people to do things, right?

The reason we don't like murder, or stealing, or things like that, is because it limits other people's ability to act within a way that actually makes their individual lives better.

So, it's important then that, when there's not externalities, we allow people to just make decisions for themselves, that they can consent into harm at so.

So it's important to recognize then, that if op gets up here and it says that this is a harmful drug, or it is something that creates harm to the individual, that's not enough of a reason for you to vote for op.

It's important to recognize that, the person has the right to engage in that action.

My second independent point is that block markets, in the status quo, are extremely harmful.

So, these exist already, right?

Things like cartels in mexico, things like even just street dealers in some suburb, exist already, and we crowd those out by legalization, because people prefer to buy in a market that has less risk.

You're less likely to be caught up in gang violence, you are less likely to be cheated out of your product, because there's no regulatory body to oversee the person engaging in a transaction with you.

People prefer to operate in the legal market, if it's an option.

So, what are the harms then, of the black market, that we get rid of by legalization?

Three independent: first, cartels, in and of themselves, create lots of violence.

When you have a black market, it is easy for powerful actors to grab up large shares of market, creating effective monopolies, that they protect those monopolies by use of violence.

This leads to huge amounts of death, it leads to mass amount of suffering.

Second is safety regulations.

It's important to note that like, when you have a black market, there's no one able to come into a production plant, and say you're not up to code, you're selling a product that is going to be harmful to people.

We should always prefer a world, where you have that regulatory capacity to step in, and say: this is an unsafe product, you are creating harm onto people by giving that product to them.

Third is access to children.

It's a lot easier for people that are probably not developmentally ready to consume this item, like the people that are most likely to be harmed by it, and the people that have the least information available then to meaningfully consent into it, are most likely going to be reached by the black market.

The reason why this is true is that, it's easy to crack down on the individual sellers, that are going around age age of sale laws like, for example, with alcohol, when you actually have a legal system, that can be regulated.

When this is not the case with a black market, it' this is why it's, like, easier for kids to get pot than it is for them to get alcohol.

So, the people, that are most vulnerable then, are more likely to be subjected to harm, in a world where the black market rules.

My third independent point is racism, and how specifically the implementation of the current law uses a tool of oppression primarily against african american communities.

Is important to recognize that, this isn't a law that's applied equally.

This is a law that is generally used to put large amounts of black men into prison, and largely used as an excuse for other things.

Things, like possession of small amounts of marijuana, can become a front for engaging in a as a means of arresting someone for something fairly unrelated, something like a traffic stop.

People cops will, like, search cars for drugs, in order to justify the arrest, things like that.

So, it's important to get rid of this tool that is used to put down black males in the status quo, and open up, like, our laws in a way that is much more reasonable.

Proud to propose.

"
"daniel_1187_cannabis_pro_opening","1187","PRO","daniel","","We should legalize cannabis for many many reasons.

So, first let's talk about how we're going to legalize it.

This isn't going to be just medical, this is going to be everything - medical and recreational.

In addition to it being fully legalized, anyone who was imprisoned, is currently serving a prison sentence, for any kind of marijuana related offense should immediately be released.

Further, anyone, regardless of if they're currently in prison, or one served, should have their record entirely expunged, and all of their rights restored, if that is their only offense.

Additionally, the state should also pay restitution for all the damages and lives that they took away, because of the the war on drugs they precipitated.

So, why are all these things necessary and just?

So, first let's talk about rights that people have.

I think that at its core, the state doesn't have the right to say that people can't smoke cannabis, I don't or do whatever they want with weed.

So, why do I think this is true?

Keep in mind that, there's a lot of different ways that individuals can choose to live their lives, and if somebody wants to get high, because they enjoy the benefits of it, because they think that it maybe it makes food taste a little bit better, maybe it makes sex a little bit better, maybe it relaxes them a little bit more, their stress if they're like stressed, maybe it can it can do anything, like things like that.

Those are incredibly reasonable decisions that people can make, if they choose to do so.

In the same way that people use alcohol for social lubrications, or you can have a glass of wine after dinner to de-stress or things like that, or smoke a cigarette, these are all things that we accept, because we accept that people have a right to make these choices with their body, but more specifically, they have the choice to make this body things that affect their own internal mental processes, especially when they don't affect other people in any kind of harmful way, because all of the effects of marijuana are limited to the individual self.

So, additionally, I also think it is important, because there's been absolutely no efficacy to the war on drugs whatsoever.

It has accomplished nothing .

It has not led to less people using drugs, in fact it has lead to more people using cannabis.

There's a reason why over fifty percent of people in the united states, which is not exactly known for being progressive on a lot of issues, supports this.

Because, people recognize that it's not working, because people have been using the drugs, and the only thing is that, the drug is getting cheaper, and it's getting stronger and more people are using it, and that's obviously - when you're spending billions of dollars on something - a failure.

But, let's talk about those billions of dollars.

Because the enforcement of these laws, that aren't working, is costing us billions of dollars each and every year, and all of that money could be used on anything, if you could burn those billions of dollars, and it would be more useful than what's happening in the status quo.

But in addition to the fact you're spending billions of dollars, there's a compounding lost, in that you're losing billions of dollars in potential tax revenue, because you can't tax you can't tax people in the marijuana industry who make income out of this, you can't tax the corporations who do these kinds of businesses, you can't tax all the employers and things like that.

So, all of that is additional lost revenue.

But, additionally, it's also bad because if you're worried about things like gateway drugs, or safe use, and things like that, it's only better if you're going to legalize it, and worse if you keep the status quo.

And the reason for that is because, if you're worried about gateway drugs, if you legalize marijuana and you go into a marijuana store, you're not going to find heroin there.

But, if you go to enough marijuana dealers, they'll probably have shrooms, they'll probably have LSD or cocaine, maybe even heroin.

I think that, it's a whole lot more likely that you're going to have these problems.

Additionally, if you're worried about underage use, it's not like a drug dealer, under the table, is going to care about if you're fifty dollars came from someone who's sixteen or twenty five, but obviously, in an institutionalized established store, that has to worry about losing its license to sell, and all of its profits, they're not going to be as willing to give weed away to minors.

So, if your problems are safe access and things like that, then it's clearly just better.

But additionally, you're also not going to have to worry about like the possibilities of there being harmful substances, because you actually know what you're going to get.

So for all those reasons, and honestly many many more, we should legalize marijuana.

"
"james_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_will","1243","CON","james","will","We should not abolish three-strikes laws.

So we're going to say that in places like california that currently use three strikes laws, this policy should continue to be implemented in the future.

Our first point, no surprises here, is about deterrence.

So, we would tell you that when people choose to commit a crime, maybe they're not acting perfectly rationally, but they still have some decision-making process about whether or not it seems like a good idea to go out and commit this crime.

Presumably, if every crime carried no penalty other than a five hundred dollar fine and a little bit of community service, people would be much more likely to commit crimes.

On the other hand, if every crime had the death penalty, I imagine many fewer people will be willing to commit a crime.

We have to find a balancing act, though, between a cruel and unusual punishment and one that deters people from committing crimes.

The reason why I think that three-strikes policies are a happy middle ground is that people really know what they're getting into.

People can understand that if you commit two crimes, then those are your first two strikes, and you're being punished according to the crime you committed.

And if you commit a third crime, then you're being punished for having become a sort of career criminal and a perpetual menace to your community.

More on that in just a moment.

But I think it's clear that people can think about this and internalize that risk of relying on crime as a way of life and that this discourages them from relying on crime in the long term as a way to support themselves.

Therefore, because it likely does deter people, we think that the policy should continue.

And will tells you about some study at one of the UCs that claims that actually decreased alcohol consumption may have played a larger role in declining crime rates.

Crime rates are down all across the united states in almost every appreciable way and there are many reasons for that, but it seems like you wouldn't be able to see the crimes that aren't being committed because people don't want to go to jail because of the three-strikes laws.

So it seems difficult to say that this hasn't had any effect when, in fact, crime has gone down since it was introduced.

Our second argument is about the good of the community.

The criminal justice system isn't really about individuals, at least in the united states.

Maybe it is more so in other countries.

But here if you commit a crime, then the state is the one who prosecutes you.

So it's the people versus will smith or whoever you want to pick, not the person who was harmed, drew latimer versus will smith.

So, at that point, we tell you that we see that the state should be concerned about what's good for everyone, not what's concerned for one particular victim or one particular person.

Communities are deeply harmed by having a strong criminal element.

If young men, in particular, in your community think that they can do better for themselves by turning to crime than by participating in society in a more social way, then ultimately that's going to harm the ability of people in your community to live normal, happy lives.

So we think this is a huge harm and that the three-strikes law goes a long way to helping these communities by ensuring that people don't turn to a life of crime.

And my last argument is about organized crime and why we think this is especially effective in that case.

A lot of organized crime relies on the idea that you have a group of people who will commit crimes for your organization, and then they go to jail, and then they get back out and go right back to working for you.

It's a lot harder to run a business like that if your people are going away for twenty-five years.

Basically, you would have to invest capital into training lots of new little criminals every year, because your more experienced people getting locked up for twenty-five years.

We don't think it would be sustainable to run a major crime ring by doing this.

And the other side might say, "" oh, well there's still organized crime in california. ""

But we've seen that the era of the crips and the bloods destroying los angeles is more or less over and that organized crime is on the decline, except for international organized crime, which is another issue.

So we think that actually this policy, at the very least, has coincided with a decline in street gangs and that this may be a major factor therein.

For all these reasons, we should not abolish three-strikes laws.

Thank you.

"
"daniel_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_yaar","1243","CON","daniel","yaar","We should keep three strikes laws for a few big reasons.

First, because these crimes are incredibly bad crimes even if they're perceived as minor felonies, and they're ones that we need to deter.

And I think that in addition to the fact these are bad and we need to deter people from doing them, I think that when people commit crimes over and over again, there is no reason to believe why they won't keep doing it, so you need to protect the population from these people.

So, let's talk about these kinds of things.

I think that it's important to first start with an overview, that the reason why we punish people when we we give people prison sentences isn't just to punish people.

If you murder someone, we're not putting you in prison just because you deserve a punishment for doing a bad thing.

We're also doing we also have laws in place because we don't want people to do these things in the first place, and because we want people who are willing to do these kind of things to stay away from the rest of society, to not be able to murder or hurt more people.

So, that's what this is going to be about, about deterrence and about isolation of people for protection.

So, let's first start by talking about deterrence.

I think that it's important to note that these crimes are oftentimes bad harms, and that there's never really a victimless crime.

Even if it's seen as like a minor felony, and you're just getting a long prison sentence for in accumulation of minor felonies, minor felony can be things like minor theft of things, so like someone's computer or like robbing a store.

It could mean minor it could be like minor instances of assault, where you like you like abuse several women, or like your girlfriend a couple of like at various points in time.

These are things that are still severe in my opinion, and these are things that are worthy of being punished.

I think that therefore you want to stop people from doing these things, and I think that the best way to do that is by a greater deterrence threat, because when there's a perceived lack of importance given to like the severity of these crimes, that is because of the fact that they're associated with only small minor prison sentences, possibly for felony it could just be probation or things like that, or parole or whatever.

And I think that therefore, when you say if you keep doing something you're going to be punished for twenty five years to life in prison, it says that the accumulation of keep doing these felonies over and over again does not suggest that it could be tolerated, and I think that people are going to be less likely to commit these crimes, because they're going to have greater punishment associated with them.

People are going to recognize and internalize the consequences of these so called minor felonies that they're committing.

But I also think that this is important as far as isolating people and protecting the population.

It's important to note that if someone commits the same crime or a similar crime or a similar felony three times, there's no reason to really believe why they're not just going to keep doing this crime over and over again.

Like if you get caught doing a bad thing three times, I don't understand why they wouldn't do it a fourth time or a fifth time, and this is bad because this because every additional time is another person that's getting assaulted, another person that's getting stolen from.

These are things that the government has an obligation to stop and an obligation to protect people from.

And I think that that's therefore a very logical grounds to put someone in prison longer, if you can't trust that person to not keep stealing, to not keep hurting people, then they should be imprisoned for a longer amount of time.

And you're by isolating this person from the rest of the population, it means that they can't steal from someone a fourth time or a fifth time.

So, three strikes laws help people doing that, and they make sure that the people are actually protected better.

And for all those reasons, we should definitely keep three strikes laws.

"
"will_1243_three-strikes_pro_opening","1243","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish three-strikes laws.

Three independent points.

The first being that these laws are fundamentally unfair.

The reason that we have protections for against cruel and unusual punishment in the united states is simple.

Inmates despite having you know committed crimes still actually have rights that they are you know people who experience suffering and that when we can mitigate that suffering we obviously should.

This you know fundamentally the reason that like we don't penalize like minor offenses with the death penalty that to some extent we want punishment to actually be proportionate to the crime.

We don't think then and that just because something is broadly classified as a felony that committing it three times justifies a life sentence.

You know something like robbery being classified as a felony for example doesn't mean that if I rob a convenience store three times I just go to jail for the rest of my life.

Like I think at some fundamental level we just have to recognize that even if this does have a deterrent effect, which I will address later as to why it most likely doesn't, there just isn't a reasonable basis upon which we can say that this is a fair punishment.

And fairness is quite important in our criminal justice system.

We want a system that actually responds properly to the nature of the crime.

A, because those inmates do have rights but b, because we want the perception that the state actually acts within the interests of its citizens.

At the end of the day, these inmates are still citizens of the united states or the state that they operate within.

As such it seems fundamentally to be a breach of the social contract then to enforce draconian rules upon them.

Our second independent point is that this is an expensive system.

So when you increase penalties to such an incredible degree, you inevitably result in prison overcrowding.

This is already a problem in california before the three-strike laws but the three-strike laws certainly have not helped that.

In fact they have made it exceptionally exceptionally easier to incarcerate individuals for prolonged amounts of time and then that generates significant expense to the state.

We think that this is a problem, not just because prison overcrowding in its own right as a right violation which it is because that results in frequently resource deprivation and a lack of personal space, but also because it puts a onerous burden on the taxpayer.

I think really the only defensible line that is often you know touted by proponents of the three-strikes laws is that it you know cleans up the streets, it makes it safer for non-offenders.

The problem is that that in and of itself is just like a benefit to non-offenders.

So if the trade-off then is absurd absurd wastes of public money and taxpayer money, I don't think that the impact calculus actually favors the three-strike laws, even when only analyzed from the perspective of non-offenders.

This is just a burden that you're putting on people for what is an unclear return.

And that unclear return part leads me into my third and final point that the deterrence factor of three-strikes laws is unclear at best.

A recent study in twenty twelve conducted at UC riverside found that there's actually very little reason to believe that the statistical decrease in crime in california had anything to do with the three-strikes laws, but actually rather with decreased alcohol consumption.

The reality is that we tend to look at the three-strikes laws is a driving factor in you know decreases in crime but the reality is that there are just significant other factors that can easily explain this and from a logical perspective most felonies are committed in the heat of the moment, which is why it's unreasonable then to assume that stricter penalties and punishments are a meaningful deterrent against committing those crimes.

Even absent all the rights violations arguments put forward then it's just unclear what the benefits of this policy are if it doesn't do anything to mitigate crime.

"yaar_1243_three-strikes_pro_opening","1243","PRO","yaar","","Fool me once shame on you.

Fool me twice shame on me.

For me three times double shame on me.

We say that if the state was unsuccessful in rehabilitating someone after giving it two shots already, then his third offense is just as much the state's fault as it is his own, and it's unfair and unreasonable to have him suffer all the consequences and all the blame.

Two arguments in this speech: first, why this proposition disproportionately targets and harms disenfranchised groups and b, why this would prove ineffective an ineffective tool in creating deterrence rendering the three strike system both unjustified and unsuccessful at what it's trying to achieve.

So first argument, all over the world prisons are disproportionately filled with minority population.

This correlation gets even stronger when it comes to re-offenders.

So it's immediately clear to us that these groups are going to be affected from this proposition most of all.

But why is that?

We say that there are three reasons.

Firstly, necessity.

When I literally have no other option, when all else fails and I need to bring food to the table somehow, then I'll resort to stealing money or stealing food.

Secondly, neglect from the government and society.

If I grew up in a poor neighborhood where all the buildings are ugly and all the schools are shitty and I look around and see neighboring areas that have it way better than me, I can't help but feel left behind.

And I start asking myself, why should I abide by the rules?

They don't have my back, why should I answer to them?

And thirdly, and most unfortunate reason, is profiling and biased treatment of the law authorities.

Minority populations suffer from more suspicion in the court systems or police officers patrolling their streets performing random arrests and so on.

This obviously leads directly to more arrests, but also indirectly tips into this distrust in the system that we've mentioned and creates more crime in an indirect way.

So this is a cycle that feeds itself.

These are all things that don't change after you get locked up.

Notice, when you return to your neighborhood, if anything, they get changed for the worse.

Your financial situation might be worse than before, your resentment for society might be bigger, so we see that crime in general, and recurring crime specifically, isn't a consequence of sociopaths as it's so convenient for us to believe, but of ongoing institutional failures that we all have a part in.

Therefore we say that society has a contributory guilt in this and as such it is impossible to offer a solution of giving up on these people, declaring them a lost cause and locking them up forever.

The only fair solution would require understanding that these are people with true hardships that the system overlooked and we really need to pay attention to.

We can attach parole officers, we can send more social workers, etcetera.

It is so convenient for the well off majority to simply tag criminals as monsters and lock them up lock them away from us and feel more secure.

But these are real people whose lives are being destroyed here.

They're they're somebody's son.

It's unfair and unjust.

Let's move on to talk about why deterrence doesn't work.

Let's clarify something: this debate is not about murder or rape, but rather theft and robbery.

Why?

Because if you're caught raping or murdering, then the punishment is usually very long, so a third offense is less likely.

So opposition might say, you know what?

We're more obligated to innocent people than people who committed crimes time and again and this helps deter crime and keeps people safe so we should do it.

This entire idea assumes that these crimes are a consequence of pure rational judgment.

Is if people calculate the probabilities and weigh pros and cons.

But we say that this doesn't work in cases of crimes that are due to lack of options, and as we saw specifically for re offenders, robbery theft are exactly such crime.

Moreover we think that the clear message to these communities, if this law passes, is that the state finally gave up on them for good.

The state that always like we always knew that the state doesn't really give a damn about us, now it doesn't even see us as human beings anymore.

This only enhances the hatred that they feel and the chances for more crime.

Kids have to see their father getting locked up for life for trying to get them a new pair of bikes.

How can they ever be expected to show respect for the police?

So maybe we put one dangerous person off the street, but at that very moment we created three more potentially dangerous people.

So for all of these reasons please propose.

"
"yaar_1250_transfat_con_opening_daniel","1250","CON","yaar","daniel","So we hear at the beginning of their speech quite a lot from side government on how much trans fat are a risk and unhealthy and leading to heart diseases and so on.

Now we're not going to argue, obviously, this is off-clash, of course, that trans fat isn't healthy, but we should pay it like we should keep in mind that sugar is also horrible for health.

So we might as well ban this is well, right?

And what about carbs and white flour?

It has also become quite apparent recently that dairy products are also terrible for one's health, so we need to cut them out as well.

And what about what tobacco does to your lungs, or what alcohol does to your liver?

And it doesn't even stop there.

We say also that it's very risky and dangerous to one's health not to indulge in any sports activity.

So, how about we force everyone to exercise?

We think we've made our point quite clear.

If we would want to force people to to lead healthy lives, then we will never see the end of it.

The question is, therefore, not whether something is healthy or dangerous, but whether it is legitimate that we make the decision for our citizens.

And we say that to that effect, we almost hadn't heard anything coming from the previous speaker.

So then we do hear about how hard it is for the consumer to know exactly when he consumes trans fat, because there's a lot of different types of of, you know, fats, so here's a couple of ideas that can solve this problem.

A: educate the public.

Go out with a with a public campaign that explains exactly how dangerous trans fat is and teaches exactly how to avoid it.

Here's a second idea: we are okay with passing a law that forces a special, like, mark for each product that contains trans fat.

Maybe we can even put warning labels, like we put on cigarette packs.

This is not a good enough reason to ban all of these products altogether.

And eventually, we hear on how hard it is to opt out, because all of the corporations want to use it because it's cheap, so here's a few answers.

Well first of all, yeah, it's true, but it's true that it's harder, but it's far from impossible.

Spoken from a vegan, I know that that I like I know a thing or two about how hard it is to avoid ingredients that are very dominant in many foods that people buy.

But you could always build your diet more like to to be based more on greens, like fruits or vegetables and and cereals and legumes, things like rice and barley and lentils and and beans and chickpeas and so on.

These are not things that are expensive in any way, and everyone can afford them.

B: we think that once we educate the public to as to the dangerous of trans fats, then there will be a market for alternative products that don't have trans fats.

Of course, such a market already exists but the more that we educate the public, the larger this market will grow.

And like any market, if it's important enough for consumers, then they will buy more of it, and this option will become more available and and and cheaper for everyone and if not, then not.

This just means that people don't care enough.

So, eventually we say that we have to treat our citizens like grownups, like big boys that are responsible for the consequences of their own decisions.

We don't have a right to force anyone to lead a healthy life or to have a healthy lifestyle.

People are allowed to hurt themselves if they so choose.

We believe that, in general, the country, the state and the law can can only intervene in actions that harm a certain third party according to the harm principle.

So all in all, very proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_1250_transfat_con_opening_yaar","1250","CON","rachel","yaar","The alternatives to banning trans fat are exactly the kinds of education that yaar says don't work.

Things like ad campaigns and targeted grants that allow schools to have better health classes and more recess times.

Things like that unlike what yaar posits are incredibly useful and we see that they've been very effective in things like decreasing the use of cigarettes where something like eighty percent less people smoke cigarettes now than even five years ago did.

It's incredibly important to notice that these kinds of that think that simple information can easily allow people to be more educated about the decisions that they're making and allow them to make better decisions without banning their options through the government.

Two main areas of clash.

First on why the standards for intervention aren't met.

Unless government is also going to ban sugar, caffeine, or any other addictive food additive then they cannot ban then they cannot rightfully been trans fat.

It is agreed by both sides of the house that you could intervene when something is distinctly harmful but government never proved somehow that trans fat was distinct because it's not more harmful than those examples I just listed.

We think that in order to preserve democracy, the government needs to be as least restrictive as possible and provide as much autonomy over their decisions to the individual as they can.

This means giving the right for people to make harmful decisions sometimes and unlike hard drugs, trans fat is less addictive and less immediately damaging than things like heroin.

Like it is much easier for someone to be fully informed about the harms and change their diet than it is to tell a drug addict this drug is bad for you because those kind of chemicals in the brain information just can't fight.

So basically at the point that we've proven to you that this is not more distinct than any other kind of mildly addicting food additive and that we and that it is and that it is not nearly as harmful as things that we currently have banned, we don't think that government has met the necessary standards in order to ban this in the first place.

But in case you don't buy that, let's talk about the harms.

Our second are of clash has to do with exactly how much banning trans fat would change the lives of specific individuals in a bad way because recognize that the kind of food that uses trans fat is oftentimes things that are cheaper.

Fast food restaurants are heavy users of trans fat any sort of like frozen good, TV dinners.

These are the like kind of groups that use trans fat because it is so cheap and is so easily mass produced and so easily used as a preservative.

What this means is that the people who rely on this kind of food are those who usually don't have the economic means to eat better, because you sure as hell aren't going to see a rich person chomping on mcdonald's all day because they know that it's bad for their bodies and they have the money to choose an alternative.

So all that government is doing is targeting people who already don't have the means and saying that because we decided this is so bad for you we prefer for you do not have enough food at all.

While opposition prefers that you eat something less healthy as opposed to just not having enough to eat in first place because we think that it's much worse for children to not have a meal than it is for them to have something that is less healthy but at least they can still function that day, they can still learn normally.

Recognize that being hungry detracts from a lot of productive abilities.

So if I didn't eat dinner that night, I'm not going to be able to focus in school the next day.

More than this though, we think this is a band aid on the obesity epidemic because people can still get fat off of unhealthy foods without trans fat being included but if you're using all of your political will to change the laws around banning trans fat, you're necessarily not targeting these kinds of problems at the core.

You need to encourage people to be able to make healthy decisions regardless of what the options before them are.

You can't just take away their options because in the end you're not going to be able to ban all kinds of unhealthy food.

You need to be able to teach people to choose between something healthy and unhealthy and choose the healthy one even though the unhealthy one tastes better.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"daniel_1250_transfat_pro_opening","1250","PRO","daniel","","We should absolutely ba?

Trans fat usage in any food, and the first reason for this is because it is incredibly unsafe.

There is no known safe amount of a bit to just ingest, and that's the reason why so many places have banned it.

Secondarily, because it's incredibly difficult to consent or know exactly what you're eating when it comes to trans fat and the consequences associated with it.

And third, because like we don't need trans fat, you can just replace it with something else that isn't as bad.

So, let's first start by talking about this like incredibly important safety concerns that are associated with trans fats specifically.

So, let's start by saying that like heart disease is like the number one cause of death in developed countries around the world, in the entire western world.

And in addition to it being the number one cause of death, we spend like billions of dollars probably tens of billions of dollars, maybe even more than that, on combatting things like health disease, and on fighting a lot of the consequences that are associated with heart disease.

But it's not even limited to that, like trans fat can also lead to things like obesity, diabetes, some people even think it could lead to like it could help us like alzheimer's, there's like a whole long list of things in which trans fat could lead these harms.

And it has a very direct way of doing that.

Like research shows that like trans fat like it's like like one of the primary things for like a heart attack or a stroke as like a clogged artery, the like worst of food that you're intaking is like trans fat leads to the clogging of these arteries, there's just like a direct link there.

So it's not like there's a some mystery about whether or not trans fat is healthy or or trans fat is actually all that bad.

Science is in, science says trans fat does cause all of these problems.

So, this is very very bad.

This is especially bad given how much it's abused and the degree to which it's used in foods, and it was prevalent in foods because it was so safe.

But all of these safety concerns are compounded by the fact that people don't understand the risks of eating it.

Keep in mind that like there's a whole lot of fats that you can see on the back of a package.

Like how can you know the difference between like a trans fat or a polyunsaturated fat or a polymonosaturated fat or like unsaturated versus saturated fats, like these things get incredibly complicated and these things have widely differing health consequences on people, and it's very like you should not have a degree to know you like a degree in chemistry or biology to know whether or not the food you're eating is healthy or the food that you're eating is safe, and this is why the regulation of these kinds of things specifically is important.

But furthermore, like like corporations are oftentimes like like like like very evil about these things.

They want you they want to use these cheaper options that are oftentimes less safe, so they try to hide the like bad consequences from from you, so that way you keep eating it.

And this is like very very bad.

And this is further compounded by the fact that when all the corporations that are profit seeking are making the same decision, it's very difficult to opt out of this, you like have to eat trans fat because all the food supply they are using is like all the food that you eat is using it and you may not even know it, and you don't even know how harmful it is for you, so all that's bad.

But, finally, all of these points to a reason why we should ban trans fat, because like we don't need it.

The unique benefit of a trans fat is that like it's semi-solid at room temperature, so it's a lot like hard like butter or soft like an oil or things like that.

But like, whoopty freeking doo, you can just like soften your butter in the oven for like thirty seconds and it's going to be roughly the same consistency or things like that.

Like this is a nonsense excuse.

Or you can just try to come up with like safer alternatives, like like palm oil isn't perfect, like you can use that too instead of like like crisco larder things like a crisco like shortening is the big culprit, things like that.

Like, the only consequence that forcing substitution of trans fat has is it's going to mean that less people are going to die, which is a good thing, and it means that corporations have to spend more money figuring it out.

Like oh no, multi billion dollar corporations have to spend money to like figure out an alternative that isn't going to kill people in their food.

I think this is a pretty reasonable restriction to put on people.

So for all those reasons, we should ban trans fat usage in food.

"
"yaar_1250_transfat_pro_opening","1250","PRO","yaar","","We should ban trans fat usage in food.

For the sake of this debate, we're willing to acknowledge that trans fat is delicious, but the core question of this debate is whether it's legitimate to make a choice for the citizens and narrow down the amount of their options.

We believe that in the specific case of trans fat, the answer is yes.

Two arguments: one, when is it possible to intervene in individual's choice, and two, harm to society, and not only to the user.

So, first argument.

In general, we support the rule according to which the state can't take decisions for the individual just to prevent them from doing like from harming themselves.

But this rule has its exceptions.

For instance, we ban many times substances that there are addictive, like heroin or cocaine, because they are deadly, like they are a deadly combination of both a serious physical harm to the person using them and they're physically addictive.

In that particular situation, the ability to treat the user as an individual with a free choice disappears.

Once a certain substance makes you physically dependent on it, then there's not much point in discussing choice.

Another exception is, for instance, when we force people to wear seat belts, even if they are driving alone.

In this case, we can simply see that the level of intervention is very small.

It's not aggressive or intrusive, just something that needs a bit of getting used to, and that's it.

But the benefits that arise from this action are huge.

And so, even though we're principally against intervening, we're not going to be dogmatic, and we don't mind doing doing so in this particular case.

When discussing trans fat, we think both these exceptions are relevant.

Firstly, trans fat is physically addictive and extremely dangerous to one's health.

This is why, by the way, it's not enough to just try and educate the public about the risks of unhealthy eating.

Informing the public isn't good enough when it comes to addictive substances.

Secondly, there are very good and healthy and cheap alternatives, so all it would take is just to get used to eating less fatty fast food.

The level of intervention here isn't serious, but the harm that's being prevented is huge.

Bottom line: the principle of individual liberty is great, but it must have its limits.

We can't cling onto it while completely ignoring the benefits.

Second argument: harm to society.

So, even if I fail in convincing you that sometimes we must intervene just to prevent people from harming themselves, clearly you'd agreed that we can intervene to protect to prevent harm from others.

Trans fats are not only harming whoever consumes them, but they're also a huge threat to the entire society.

We've obesity on the rise and heart diseases as the main source of mortality in the western world.

More and more people are becoming too ill to work and are required to undergo treatments that form a huge burden on the entire economy.

Society has a collective interest in safekeeping its citizens' health.

So, even if it's a free choice, when a man chooses to harm his his own health, he harms his productivity as well, and the entire society is built upon reciprocating productivity.

Therefore, he's harming his entire surroundings.

Now, of course, that on an individual level, every trans fat eater is neglectable but on the aggregate level, we already reach a serious problem.

This surely gives us all the legitimacy we need to intervene.

So, for all of these reasons, please propose.

"
"will_1264_human-cloning_con_opening_james","1264","CON","will","james","I'm proud to oppose the motion that we should ban human cloning.

Our first independent point is the spillover technology associated with human cloning.

So we think that when you're talking about you know creating a new human in a test tube or whatever lab environment you're looking at there's a lot associated with that process that's important to understanding the human body at a very fundamental level much in the way that research for things like say going to the moon don't necessarily have to have a you know intrinsic end point gain or value because the research that's conducted along the way often leads to benefits.

We think that human cloning would have profound impacts on our medical understanding of the human body.

We think that the ability to generate an entire human being would also yield technology relating to you know generation of limbs or other body parts that people might be missing.

This could solve for the organ donation shortage that many countries experience.

This could solve you know the need for prosthetics which are often unwieldy and comparatively less valuable than just having a limb in the first place.

We think then that even if you buy all of government's arguments about the suffering endured by clones we think that there are massive impacts on the medical community and medical research in a way that greatly outweighs it.

This is true for two reasons.

First we think that the rights of clones are questionable.

At the point where we derive human rights you know from a specifically human centric perspective we often for example don't extend the same rights to animals as we do to humans.

We think there is something innate about membership in humanity that gives you rights.

At that point then we think it is unlikely that people will value kit clones as like having individual rights - but secondly we think this was more a more significant issue.

Because we believe that there are just going to be like more regular people than there will be clones especially in the early days we imagine the clones will be incredibly expensive to develop so given that we think then that the the medical benefits associated with it will benefit billions of people whereas on the rights infringements upon clones will be relatively minimal due to the small number of clones.

Our second independent point is that we think that this can literally just make for better people.

So gov has like a lot of hand wringing over whether or not you know companies or firms or whatever are going to self select for traits that they find desirable.

I think that this is probably a good thing though because a lot of the times the traits that would be selected for are traits that are generally pretty widely accepted as good things by society.

Like for all the hand wringing about like eugenics or whatever I think the comparative here is that we're not going to eradicate the people that have traits were trying to root out we'll obviously still continue to provide for people that for example have heart conditions at birth.

But we also think that it's nice to have a system wherein we can genetically select for genes that make you less likely to have heart conditions.

At that point then we think that the select a the research associate with cloning can make this an easier process but b that by creating clones that are biologically comparable to humans we can literally just have clones enter the gene pool and like create a gene pool that you know reduces the number of people with you know medical complications at birth and that sort of thing.

Our third and final independent point is that we think that clones have utility in and of themselves.

So I think a lot of what I've discussed already kind of demonstrates this at a very big scale level but we think even at an individual level clones can just make for a better society.

I think much like say in like brave new world there's like a world where you can just make clones that aren't necessarily self aware that are almost like animals to an extent and at that point then we think a lot of the labor benefits that you incur from having clones at a cheap level are fairly acceptable because they would have a right structure that's relatively comparable to animals.

But we also think that that utility derives from the fact that you're essentially telling a few clones superhumans that they have to sort of sacrifice their rights for the good of for the greater good and we think that infringement of rights upon a select group of clones is makes it worth the up vast benefits that would be brought to humanity.

Proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_1264_human-cloning_con_opening_tim","1264","CON","yaar","tim","So side governments case in this debate basically says the following thing, there are no clear advantages to the cloning of specifically human beings that we cannot achieve by cloning human organs or cloning animals or bringing babies to the world.

But there are a few potential ethical problems that might arise with regard to how society treats the cloned people.

We are going to win this case by first pointing to some great advantages in specifically human cloning, and secondly by showing you why all of the concerns that were brought up by side government are technical and solvable and not inherent.

But before that we think that we need to discuss the mental state or the mental situation of these clones, because this can help bring a little bit order to this discussion and make it a little less blurry.

I think that we need to ask whether my clone also includes all of my personal traits and my memories or is it like a totally new born baby that comes to the world tabula rasa.

The other side chose not to address this question but I think that it is implied from their logic that we are talking about the former.

That a clone like we're talking about clones that are that are created as exact replicas of the person there they were cloned from.

And this includes also mental state and whatever stems from this.

Because you know they talk to us about the clones being human agents and about property claims to the like of the original person.

So from now on we are simply going to assume that this is the situation we're going to go with that.

Okay so side government don't see any advantages to cloning.

Here are some meaningful ones: a, if god forbid, I lost my kid or my partner in a car accident or something, cloning might help me bring him back to life.

That's right, I'm talking about overcoming death.

If this is not a meaningful benefit, I truly don't know what is.

B, it is possible to clone great thinkers.

Now think about how much could be achieved if there were two or three more einstein's that could join forces in research of the universe.

Now there's a lot more to say, but I think that we'll settle for these two advantages for now.

And note that these are advantages that could in no way be achieved by simply cloning sheep and are unique to human cloning.

Oh but what about the ethical problems that tim talks about?

Well let's see.

First he talks to us about there being property rights issues to the clone.

This is a very weird point.

This will be a person, not a property.

No one has property rights to it.

Like, problem solved.

Next he talks about cloned organ reaping farms or something.

Now never mind the fact that a minute before that, he tells us himself that we are already developing technologies for cloning organs that are going to solve this shortage problem therefore there's no sense in such farms.

But hey here's an idea, let's outlaw such farms if they do if they will exist.

Human cloning will probably be easy enough to supervise.

It's expensive as team says, it's not something that you could simply do with great ease and speed at some back alley, so it will be pretty easy for us to make sure that this doesn't happen.

Problem solved.

And then tim tells us that society is going to treat these clones with great cruelty.

Now perhaps that's true, society is in fact not very patient towards whoever is considered different.

But it's it's no different from problems of prejudice and discrimination that minority populations have to deal with every day.

This is simply a matter that takes some time and an adjustment period and and eventually this will be solved as well.

It might take a few generations for sure, but that by itself is not a good enough reason to curtail the scientific progress and to prevent all of the great advantages of human cloning.

Please oppose the motion.

"
"tim_1264_human-cloning_pro_opening","1264","PRO","tim","","We should ban human cloning.

So we think it's simply the case that there are a massive amount of risks that come with allowing human cloning that come with allowing people to clone themselves or for corporations to clone other people with very little gains that can come from this.

Recognize that the process of cloning can still be tested under this model through other animals, that you can still produce organs in a number of ways.

In fact, organ production, human organ production is already being done in a number of different ways through a number of different methods that don't involve human cloning.

We simply think that is the case that there's no real game.

So why do we think that's the case?

If you create human agents you should treat that human agent as such.

What that means is that if you were to create a clone than that clone should be given the full rights of any other human agent simply by the nature of their humanity.

Just because they are a the same genetic makeup of another human being doesn't mean that they can't internalize the harms that will be placed upon them such as that other human being.

It doesn't mean that they don't have the right to their own autonomy, their own agency.

It doesn't mean that because they're derived from a method other than natural birth that they aren't still a human and deserve the rights that come with that.

What this means is that any if you were to create a human clone that human should be created as a new free individual but this is an incredibly costly process and given that the outcome of that costly process would be essentially the same outcome of giving birth we simply don't see any massive benefit to doing this.

Maybe there are scientific advancements you can gain but we don't see what scientific advancements you gain particular specifically through human cloning that you wouldn't be able to gain through learning about how cloning works in other organisms and other animals.

There's nothing about human biology that is so unique that we couldn't learn or get scientific breakthroughs through other methods of cloning but what you do get is you don't create a new human agent when you do cloning through other species.

We think other scientific knowledge knowledge can be gained from cloning animals but we simply don't think the massive cost of cloning a human is worth the outcome of creating a new agent but what we do think is likely to be the case is that if you were to put this cost in people would have some some sort of expectation of that cloned person.

We think there are a number of ethical qualms that come with cloning.

The first is a property right to a clone.

The question of who has property to a cloned individual is something that we think is likely to arise and along with identity problems that come with that clone.

The identity problems of the original person and of his clone knowing who they are and being able to relate to the world.

We think that that kind of psychological burden is unfair, not to mention the fact that there is now a property claim being contested between the original individual who has been cloned and probably the corporation or the lab that was to clone them.

We think there's a potential for organ farms which we think is incredibly problematic because if you were to create this high cost business of cloning human beings, we think it's likely that you'd want some sort of economic return on that and we can a very easy economic return is given the massive shortage in in the need for organ donations, we think organ farms are likely and again this would lead to human agents being stripped of their organs and used as a means to an end.

Something that we can see huge ethical problem and something that shouldn't potentially be allowed.

We also think there's a potential for human for for humans to have their rights stripped.

We think there's a massive potential that no matter what type of economic end you want to retreat from this, that whatever clone is the result of this process is likely going to face massive stigmatization, massive harms to their identity, and ultimately are likely to have their rights stripped to the point in which they are no longer human, but that doesn't mean that these harms wouldn't gather on that person.

It doesn't mean that this person this this clone wouldn't internalize the harms of such practices and given that these practices are likely to arise from such a process of human clothing cloning, we think we should cut it off at the head.

We think we should ban human cloning to to prevent these things from ever arising and for these reasons, we should ban human cloning.

"
"james_1264_human-cloning_pro_opening","1264","PRO","james","","We should ban human cloning.

So by this we mean that all nations around the world should forbid human cloning for any purpose.

We're not going to make a distinction between so-called therapeutic and reproductive cloning in this debate.

We think that any cloning of a human being ought be illegal in every country around the world.

So, two arguments for why we think this is the case.

The first is that we think that it would be deeply unethical to clone another human being because of the effect it would have on the clone once produced.

Imagine the person that you create when you clone a human being.

You create a person who has no mother, no father.

Someone who has no family, no place where they belong in society, presumably they're going to be raised by the state or by these scientists who have treated them.

So we think it's very very improbable that this person will ever have a happy, fulfilling, normal life.

Ordinarily, society goes to great lengths to facilitate children having happy, normal lives so that they can go on to become productive citizens.

We see that the state spends a great deal of money facilitating adoptions to loving homes for instance, and a great deal of money removing children from unhappy homes.

So what happens when you have this cloned child who belongs to say, I don't know, the university of michigan who is being raised by a team of scientists, who presumably does not receive the same kind of nurturing and love that a child being raised elsewhere would.

You're creating someone who, in the best case, lives in some version of foster care and in the worst case is treated like a lab rat.

We think that this is deeply troubling and completely unfair.

This clone child is no less deserving of an ordinary, happy life than any other human being.

They're a human, they have a soul like anyone else, but we think it's improbable that they will ever be provided with these opportunities.

We also tell you that it's deeply troubling that you give private corporations or universities the ability to effectively create people for their own ends.

We think that once you allow cloning, it's likely that companies are going to clone people with certain traits in order to examine their genome.

Say, you'll have people created for a very specific research purpose.

We think that this is likely to lead those people to have severe psychological issues once they're old enough to understand that they were effectively created like a lab rat who's bread to have brown fur.

We don't think that it's acceptable to put anyone, particularly an innocent child, into this situation.

So we ought ban cloning because it is clearly not in the interest of these hypothetical, cloned children.

Our second argument is about the legal difficulties behind permitting human cloning.

Ordinarily, a child's next of kin have a certain legal obligation to that child.

In some countries it might only be the parents, in other countries this obligation might extend past the parents to other close relatives, but we see that no one has a legal obligation to the clone.

At least that's what it seems to me since they don't have a mother or father the way that another person would.

So does, to use my earlier example, the university of michigan have an obligation to feed and clothe this child?

We think that it's very impersonal to assert that that's the case, and we think that it's very like that you would end up with cloned children who don't have clear legal guardians that they would follow in the guardianship of the state, which is obviously something that we want to avoid because of both the expense to the public and also the way that it affects the child.

But I also think it's troubling in terms of the relationship of the cloned child to the cell donor because recognize, you know if someone was making clone of a person, maybe they would take one of my skin cells and grow it into a new clone.

What is the clone's relationship to me at that point?

We think that this is very unclear and that there's no satisfactory resolution to this.

Do I have the same obligation as a father or do I have no obligation?

Because it is unfair to the clone first of all and secondarily because of legal difficulties, we should ban human cloning.

Thank you.

"james_1322_beauty-pageants_con_opening_tim","1322","CON","james","tim","We should not ban beauty pageants.

And just to be clear, what we're defending on our side, we would be fine with having a minimum age to enter beauty pageants, but we think that it would be wrong to categorically ban them completely in society.

Our first argument is about personal freedom.

We think that at its root, it would be very patronizing to ban beauty pageants, because it assumes that the people who participate in them do not understand the benefits and harms that beauty pageants may have in their own life.

The other side tells you that beauty pageants subject women to the male gaze and encourage them to participate in patriarchal norms.

But we think that it's quite possible that the women who participate in them are fully aware of the fact that they're being judged on their appearance, how could they not be, and choose to participate in this because they see some potential for personal gain.

Why should it be that if someone is extraordinarily beautiful, the government should intervene to prevent them from making money off of their appearance?

How is participating in a beauty pageant different than being a model or an actress in some cases?

The other side might say, "" oh, this doesn't require talent like those things do "", but we think that some models require more talent than others.

Should we ban people from being porn stars as well because it might be degrading?

Whether or not we ought to, we don't, so we don't think we should single out people who participate in beauty pageants.

We think that the women who participate, especially if they're adults, are able to make their own decisions.

And if we're okay with letting people participate in other activities that could potentially demean them in the eyes of men, we don't think that you should ban this one thing uniquely.

But what's more, implicit in many of the arguments of the other side is that it is anti-feminist to have beauty pageants.

But we would advance a conception of feminism in which by making their own choices about how to live their lives, even if women choose to participate in patriarchal power structures, they're empowering themselves and that this should be the end goal of feminism.

In other words, we should want men and women to be equally capable of making their own choices, even if we don't like the choices that they make in some instances.

You and I may think that people shouldn't participate in beauty pageants, but we ought empower people to make that choice rather than take the choice away from them.

It seems difficult to argue that by removing women's ability to make a choice, in this case to participate in beauty pageants, that you somehow increase their personal freedom, which we think should be the end goal of a feminist movement that claims to empower women.

Our second argument is that banning beauty pageants doesn't actually solve any problem in society, so we ought not to do it.

We think that governments, in general, should only intervene to ban something or require something if it would make a meaningful difference in people's lives.

If the net outcome of a policy is going to be the status quo, it would be better for government to just do nothing.

So what problems might beauty pageants cause?

They might cause people to view women as objects, they might cause people to respect women less.

But we see that both of these are problems already, even without beauty pageants.

I don't think that the miss america pageant is the reason that people are sexist towards women or objectify them.

There are many other reasons in our culture that this might be the case.

I mentioned modeling earlier, and I think it's quite likely that as long as you continue the trend of marketing products by having beautiful women appear in their commercials that people will objectify women.

So I just don't think that beauty pageants are the underlying root of this problem.

At that point, by banning beauty pageants, you don't actually do anything to make the world a better place.

So what's the comparative here?

In a world in which you allow beauty pageants, some people are able to benefit from participating in them.

Yes, that's a world in which sexism and patriarchy exist, but the alternative world is one in which people can't choose to participate in beauty pageants, but in which the world remains patriarchal and sexist.

We would prefer the one with more freedom to the one to less when the patriarchy remains on either side.

Thank you.

"
"yaar_1322_beauty-pageants_con_opening_eitan","1322","CON","yaar","eitan","Ladies and gentlemen, we have an interesting opposition line for you today.

Let's see how this goes.

We fully accept that there is a problem with beauty pageants in the status quo, but unlike proposition, we do not think that the root of the problem lies with objectification itself, but rather with the inequality or the disproportionality of that objectification and that is what we aim to fix.

That's right, rather than less female beauty pageants, we offer more dominance to male beauty pageants and male objectification in general.

We believe that true liberation for women means having them treated equally.

For decades, we have tried to achieve that goal by changing our approach or the way that we treat women.

This has worked partially and very slowly and unlike we would have wanted.

Perhaps it's time to change our approach and change the way that we treat men.

Specifically, we advocate in this debate that the already existing and rapidly growing phenomenon of things like chippendales, backstreet boys, one direction and justin bieber.

Now, here's something that I never thought that I would say.

Truly, our line is simple.

We simply say that people are naturally attracted to beauty.

We are programmed to rate the other sex based on appearance.

This is true to both men and women.

The problem is that for centuries, male dominance has led our society to a situation in which it is no longer socially acceptable for women to publicly rate men on their appearance, whereas to men, this is still considered okay.

In this point, we are required to choose between waging war against human nature, one that we that would be basically impossible for us to win because it's a war against our nature, or harnessing our nature to obtain our our purpose.

Why do we think that the second option is better?

Because the true problem today is that many men feel that they can appreciate women solely based on their appearance, but in a world where men and women are being objectified left and right, we say that men no longer have the privilege of their like, genders that of their gender being considered superior.

There is this perceived equality that trickles down to the minds of men and women alike.

This is obviously a gradual situation, but we believe that in within a few generations, we will most definitely be there.

As a result, we think that society would have no choice but to change in such a way that no one is rated no one is rating no one solely based on appearance, but based on also appearance alongside smarts and capabilities and every other thing that we would would like people to be valued by.

Why?

Why is this true?

Because society needs those metrics and it will never allow a situation where everyone are being rated and ranked solely based on appearance.

So, at the point in which there is no longer one sex that we can objectify and another sex that's being that's being valued by other parameters, we say that everyone is gonna be judged by all of the parameters.

So, if you guys ever want to truly achieve real equality for women, you have to oppose this motion.

"
"eitan_1322_beauty-pageants_pro_opening","1322","PRO","eitan","","One crucial thing to keep in mind throughout this debate.

Oppositions are going to tell you that the harms from beauty pageants aren't so greater, that they're not unique to beauty pageants.

Just remember while they're telling you this, that the benefit you get from beauty pageants is nonexistent.

The benefit is the entertainment of men sitting at home, enjoying seeing women paraded in front of them.

That's not a big enough benefit to excuse almost anything, and we think the harms of beauty pageants are massive.

Two such harms: one, the perpetuation of negative north, and two, on the self esteem in impressionable young women.

Let's start talking about perpetuation of negative norms.

Three such norms: one, objectification.

At the point at which women are paraded across the state dressed up differently, performing different acts, always less-clothed, always just for their beauty, judged by a panel of women and men giving them literal number values based on how they look, you're pushing women ever more into the box of an object, of something that's to be appreciated for what it looks like, as opposed to what it who it is or what they say or how they think.

Secondly, you perpetuate rape culture.

Not because women are scantily clad, we think that's fine, but because of the way you objectify women, you perpetuate the notion that they exist for the appreciation and enjoyment of men.

Once you perpetuate that notion, you perpetuate the idea that it is within a man's rights to take what is his, that he can use a woman for his enjoyment, because that's what they're doing up on stage in front of everyone.

Lastly, it perpetuatea gender norms.

It's not just that they're scantily clad, it's not just that they're parading around, but they always get voted on their ideals and supposedly what they perform in their acts and their speeches.

And you'd note that consistently over years, the winners are people who talk about things like happiness and joyfulness and world peace, and perform things like art and happy thinking.

You've never seen a woman go up there and perform a chemist experiment, because that's just not ladylike.

So we say it perpetuates gender norms.

Crucially, we're not saying that women up there didn't choose to be up there.

We're saying that them being up there is harmful to women all over the world, and doing this harm to other people should be discontinued.

Secondly, let's talk about self esteem in impressionable young women.

Two things we say we think this does.

One, it ties self esteem to beauty.

How does it do that?

Using childhood tropes of value.

Things like the word queen thrown around in beauty queen or princess, things like a crown given to the winner and a sash given to everyone who participates.

The ball that these people enter into, all of this terminology, all of these tropes, throw women back to the stories they were told us children and to the equations they create of what is valuable in this world.

Using that, they portray value as external good looks.

A second thing that they do is they set an unachievably high bar to this value, so they tell women you are to be valued based on how you look, they do this literally by value in women based on how their looks that they look in, setting it to tropes of what should be important to women all around the world.

And then they make that goal way too high to achieve, way too difficult.

What does all this do?

It sets in depression, it sets in eating disorder, it sets in unhappiness.

All of this for what?

So that a few people can enjoy watching a few pretty girls scamper around on stage.

We don't think it's worth it.

Please cancel beauty pageants.

"
"tim_1322_beauty-pageants_pro_opening","1322","PRO","tim","","We should ban beauty contests.

We think that, in the status quo, beauty contests are largely used to allow women to be viewed through a male gaze, in which largely male panels and patriarchal ideas of beauty are enforced upon women, and awards are given to them for how well they can ascribe to those patriarchal ideas.

We think that this is a vastly outdated notion, and that beauty contests only exist to perpetuate these notions, with very little gain for the pageant entry individuals themselves.

So, that's what we're going to talk about in this speech, about how beauty contests set bad norms, and about why this is a a justification for a ban.

So, why does it set that norms?

We think in practice, people are rewarded largely for traditional beauty standards.

When you view something like the miss america pageant or the miss universe pageant, they have sections in which people are supposed to give speeches about things they're passionate about, or the things that show off talents that they have.

But when you see these things, you recognize that these women are largely not judged based on all of those possibilities.

Look at president donald trump who had a stake in miss america	 and miss universe, as an individual who enforced those ideas of those patriarchal notions of beauty in a woman, and views those things as largely credible as a means of judging women, and did so in these pageants.

We think that given that this is the case, it's overtly clear that the vast majority of judgment that takes place in this is almost solely on the looks of women.

We think this reinforces the idea of women being objectified, that women can be distilled into the idea of an object that you view as beautiful or not beautiful, and which you can award as you would award any other painting or art work.

We think that this dehumanizes the women and we actually think it creates immense amounts of trauma for the people that participate in these things, and additionally increases social pressure.

We recognize that beauty standards aren't created by beauty contests, but they do serve as a major force for enforcing those things with very little gain for the women that compete in these things, maybe they earn so maybe one or two women are able to earn enough money to survive for a long period of time, but this does not weigh the fact that little girls and people that are growing up, impressionable young women are learning about what they need to look like, what they need to do, how their bodies need to look, when they view these beauty contests.

And we think that these enforce incredibly unhealthy standards, both physically unhealthy and mentally unhealthy, for these girls, and we simply don't think it is worth the risk.

We think when you it also reproduces the practice of women being judged through the male gaze.

A practice that has been perpetuated throughout all of human history.

We think that as an enlightened and modern society, we should move past into a society in which women don't need to go to men for their type of for they don't have to go to men for approval, but rather can get that approval internally, can justify their existence based on things other than their appearance.

So why do we think that these arguments are enough to justify a ban?

Well, we think that bans are acceptable when there are large social externalities, and what we mean by this is that the government is justified in intervening to ban any sort of products or practice or these types of things, when the practices of that type of thing that is being banned extend beyond those that are able to consent into the impacts.

And what we mean by this is that women, young girls, are not able to consent to the harms, the psychological harms that come from beauty contests.

Well, contestants themselves may be able to consent to any of these things.

The fact that these things inevitably influence people on a subconscious and unconscious level is something that the that these people cannot consent into, that goes against the idea of the basic worth of women as human beings and not as objects.

When it undermines the basic humanity of these people, without the consent of individuals who are subconsciously being impacted in this way, we think it is a sufficient enough sufficient enough reason to ban beauty contests, and we think that there is clear harm that derives from them.

Given all of these things, we believe we should ban beauty contests.

"
"sam_1346_biofuels_con_opening_daniel","1346","CON","sam","daniel","I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should subsidize biofuels.

Although they have the name bio in the name and although many individuals like to pretend as though biofuels are more efficient or better for the environment, most biofuels are actually worse than fossil fuels.

Ethanol in particular which is made from corn leads to massive over use of the corn population and generally leads to many of the same harms as fossil fuels.

When government decides to step in and subsidize it, it disrupts the market and harms the environment as well.

I have two arguments in today's debate.

First, that biofuels are inefficient and secondly, that they are bad for the environment.

On the inefficiency of biofuels, I'm gonna discuss why the market is the best way in which to determine the price of certain goods and why stepping is generally bad.

That the market can capture the vast majority of information prices determine the harms in which certain individuals take to produce a good and the benefits which the consumer gets from consuming that good.

The only time in which we ought to subsidize a particular technology is when there are externalities which cannot be captured.

Recognize that biofuels are are an alternative primarily to fossil fuels but biofuels do not produce generally less CO two or other problematic things than fossil fuels.

What this means is that the government is deciding to subsidize the particular usage of biofuels even though it is really not any better than fossil fuel.

We are paying out of our pocket in order to allow certain people to buy fuel cheaper.

Additionally, convincing individuals to bio this buy this fuel because it's decrease in price will also be bad.

Ethanol is incredibly inefficient.

It's less productive per gallon than your average thing of oil.

Using this sort of biofuel will do little more than harm the environment, disrupt the market, and decrease our quality of life.

Markets are incredibly effective at determining the best good for society writ large and changing that price also harms society.

It will lead to overproduction and over consumption based on what the optimal usage is and the taxpayer will pay for it.

As such, we ought not subsidize biofuel because it is incredibly inefficient in this regard.

Now my second argument is that biofuel is bad for the environment for two main reasons.

First, it is incredibly difficult to make.

When you take into account the environmental costs of growing corn, growing any other kind of fuel, and then changing it into a usable form such that it can be used in cars or in industry, the ultimate cost is incredibly high.

It causes much more CO two, causes much more greenhouse gas emissions, and causes much more environmental degradation than your average production of oil.

Even in cases of fracking, what these biofuels do is leach into the environment and leach in to the environment through the pesticides used to grow them and then cost massive amounts to make in the first place.

The current subsidies of biofuel are incredibly inefficient and have generally been opposed.

The only reason they haven't been absolutely removed is the lobbying power of the agricultural industry and the oil industry which honestly do not have the best interest of the people at heart.

The second reason it's bad for the environment is it removes alternatives.

We think it's incredibly problematic that we remove alternative forms of fuel then biofuel and regular gasoline.

What I mean by this is that the reason we have pushes toward things like tesla or electric cars in general is because of increasing prices of fuel.

Subsidizing biofuel, trying to make it a hip and cheaper alternative to all other forms of transportation will ultimately make it so things like electric cars or hybrid cars will fall in popularity.

This is incredibly problematic because this is the only way that we can decrease our footstep in terms of transportation.

As such, we should not subsidize biofuels.

"
"james_1346_biofuels_con_opening_rachel","1346","CON","james","rachel","This house would not subsidize biofuels.

So in this debate we're arguing that the american government should not subsidize biofuels.

We have four points in this debate.

First, we think that the subsidy of biofuels undermines better alternative sources of energy.

Governments are uniquely poorly suited to pick winners and losers in industry.

We think philosophically this is important to keep in mind, that governments are always going to be made up of individuals who have their own interests at heart.

So people who stand to make money on this are likely to support it and any implementation of this policy is likely to be done in such a way that individual congressmen make money.

But aside from that we tell you that it's very unlikely that government will correctly identify the best technologies to invest in.

When you introduce all of these subsidies everyone wants to invest their research into getting those subsidies.

This means that people are going to turn away from other technologies that might be more effective, like better battery technology at actually reducing our dependence on biofuels.

And this also creates a lock in effect.

Where once a lot of people use biofuels it's very difficult to transition to other sources of energy instead.

So ultimately we might be left with a less efficient form of alternative energy than if we wait and let the market decide what we should adopt.

Our second argument is that government money is fungible.

What we mean by this is that giving money to corporations is not preferable to giving money to the american people.

Recognize that this is basically corporate welfare.

You say if you do the kind of production that we want, we will subsidize you, we'll give you some money back.

But that's money that isn't going to other programs like snap or wic which are important american social welfare programs.

We think that ultimately even if you want to keep this money focused on climate change, things like providing for people who are displaced by climate change or cleaning up the damage of coal power plants et cetera, would all be better uses of this money that have more immediate tangible impacts for people on the ground than giving handouts to large corporations that make cars with bio fuel.

Our third argument is that this won't actually do anything to change the incentives of large oil companies.

BP, exxon, whatever large oil companies the other side thinks are going to be harmed by this policy to reduce oil production actually won't change.

International growth is the driver of increasing oil consumption.

As people in places like india and china have a higher standard of living, they're going to want cars, they're going to want things that rely on oil.

The other team might say, oh, but they'll adopt biofuels as well.

Guess what?

India is already the leading user of alternative fuels like liquid natural gas, but that doesn't mean that they're oil demand isn't also increasing because of development.

So what that means is that exxon and BP will keep drilling the same amount of oil no matter what.

And there's actually no solvency here to reduce carbon emissions because the oil is coming out of the ground either way.

Our last point in this debate is about what we just heard from rachel about international instability.

So rachel tells us that ultimately it's good if we move to biofuels because it means that we're less dependent on middle eastern dictators.

But I want to push back on this idea that saddam hussein or muammar qaddafi or whatever boogie man you prefer controls international oil.

It's true that europe imports lots of oil, but most of it comes from russia rather than the middle east.

And in the united states essentially all of our oil comes from latin america or domestic production or canada.

So what that means is the people you actually put pressure on, our putin in particular, the russians in general, we saw that in the past the invasion of crimea was partly driven because putin needed to shore up his position as a leader because oil prices had fallen so the economy wasn't doing well.

So we think that ultimately strong men like putin or like middle eastern sheiks who rely on oil are forced to be more aggressive when you undermine their oil revenue and that this will lead to international instability which is a tremendous harm of this policy.

So for these four reasons we would not subsidize biofuels.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_1346_biofuels_pro_opening","1346","PRO","rachel","","The motion for today's debate is: this house would subsidize biofuels.

This house, being the united states government.

Two many areas of clash, the first on the importance of government subsidization.

We tell you that new technology is incredibly expensive, and on both an individual and corporate level.

What this means is that, in order to make a system change, especially a system as ingrained in oil and gas running cars, as the american economy, there needs to be an outside impetus that shows corporations that there is an investment, and shows individuals that they can still save money in the long term.

Let's explore these two layers separately.

Recognize that on a corporate level, corporations are generally risk averse.

What this means is that, they do not pour money into things that they do not feel will bring back money to the corporation.

We tell you that, corporations recognize america's dependency on oil, recognize that they themselves cannot permeate the market, and thus do not put money into innovating new kinds of biofuels, or new kinds of biofuel running cars.

Subsidizing subsidizing biofuels would also create a market for them.

What this means is now, on an individual level, people will feel like biofuel running cars are worth the long term investment, because recognize that, with new technology, it's likely that that car is going to be more expensive than the car they currently drive.

In order to justify giving in money for this new item, they also have to justify that, in the long term, it will be cheaper.

This is the same rationale we use when people buy a car that is more expensive, but they expect to last for longer.

They know that, even though they're showing more money out in the short term, in the long term, they will end up paying less.

We tell you that, the development of a market, by means of the consumer, signals to corporations that they can invest more freely, and pump out new ideas, and new innovations.

This brings us to our second area of clash, which has to do with the harms of the oil and gas industry.

Because besides the obvious environmental impacts of upping the amount of greenhouse gases, that cause global warming, and pollute our environment, there's also an economic dependency cost.

Recognize that, the majority of powers, that holds the monopoly over oil and gas, are middle eastern and non western.

What this means is that a country such as the united states have massive dependencies on middle eastern countries, that cause their economies to be dependent on how those function.

What this means is that, if in a given year, the middle eastern country cannot produce enough oil, or decides to raise the price in order to manipulate the market, the american economy goes with it.

This is very problematic, insofar as the whim of one of the leaders of these gas or oil industries can stop the stop up america's highways for days.

But there's a second layer to this.

We tell you one of the massive reasons that america doesn't sanction saudi arabia, but is willing to sanction other countries, such as israel, is because they are not they're more afraid of saudi arabia, and the control they have over the american economy, in the form of oil.

We tell you that, if america is able to produce its own fuels, and is unafraid of the manipulation of its economy, that saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries can cause, they are more likely to step up in situations of human rights abuses.

More than in this though, we tell you that subsidizing biofuels encourages innovation.

This is good on two levels: first, we can get benefits to the domestic economy, but it also helps in the global economy.

First, on the domestic economy.

We tell you that, showing that a market exists and investing in that market signals to corporations that it's time to innovate in this sphere, in order to make more money.

What this means is that, more different kinds of biofuels, different kinds of biofuel running cars, are more likely to be developed on our side of the house, insofar as they know that they can actually sell their products.

But recognize what this does on a global market as well.

If america is able to become one of the main global players in developing their own bio fuel, and bio fuel technology, they're able to sell this to other global powers.

Given that this is a newly developing market, and a few other countries have gotten very far, we tell you that becoming one of the first allows america to build their own niche market in the global economy.

For these reasons, proud to propose.

"
"daniel_1346_biofuels_pro_opening","1346","PRO","daniel","","Biofuels are great, and we should absolutely subsidize them, because the subsidies are ultimately going to drive greater support, and investment, and innovation, and creation in this field, which is going to be absolutely crucial for making sure that you get cheaper fuel sources, more available and accessible fuel sources sources, and greener fuel sources.

So, let's break all of this down.

First, why do I think that government subsidies and investment in biofuels is crucial to its survival?

And I think that the reason for this is because, right now these are still growing technologies, growing sources of alternative energy, that can be used to replace the currently ingrained like more standard sources of fuel, that we use.

So, I think that when the government subsidizes these things, it makes it much more economically feasible for people to try to make innovations in biofuels.

That means trying to find ways to make biofuels cheaper, trying to find ways to make biofuels more efficient.

These are all things that I think are incredibly important for moving biofuels as a viable option forward, but additionally I think that, when you when you subsidize biofuels, and just the process of bringing more people into it also creates more of an economies of scale, for it creates more of an economies of scale for biofuels.

So, that, sense more people are going to now be working on it, and it's going to be more production of it, and more like cost decreases it, and things like that, from the competition, all of these are going to mean that, like at the next level, manufacturers are gonna be more incentivized to create things that accommodate biofuels, and these set off like chain reaction in ways that, really ingrain biofuels as actual part of the economy.

So, I think that, that's going to be great, because first, biofuels are just simply a lot more sustainable, and they're going to be a lot better for the climate.

And, this is, by itself, the most important thing that you can possibly consider in this debate, because, making sure that you have a cleaner source of energy, given how many like billions of billions of people around the world like drive, or give off some kind, or use some kind of non biofuel for like heating or anything else.

This is a drastic way that you can decrease dependence on oftentimes like dirty pollutants, like coal, or having to like extract oil at a great environmental risk, or not having to release as much heat, or CO two emissions into the atmosphere, which leads to global warming, and all those bad things associated with it, all of that could be benefited.

But, additionally I think that biofuel is going to be , when it's further developed, a lot more accessible, because anyone can use animal manure, or food scraps, or any other kinds of things, like plants, any other kinds of things as fuel.

These are things that are just wildly widely available, just about everywhere around the world.

So, it also means that fuel is going to be a lot more accessible, it's not going to cost as much, so if you're like a poor community, or if you're a poor country maybe, it's going to be a lot cheaper for you to industrialize, and to gain access to a lot of resources, because cost of basic energy are going to go down.

And finally, I think that it's important to look at the bigger picture, about biofuel subsidies.

Because, at the end of the day, even if we're talking about like tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for biofuels, the possible economic payoffs that we're talking about are essentially like invaluable, we're talking about the like saving of the world, in terms of climate change, or billions of dollars in saving in energy costs being slashed entirely in the long run.

And, at the end of the day, these kinds of investments just aren't that much money for a government to make.

They're incredibly reasonable, and they have very likely a good payout.

So, for all those reasons, we should subsidize biofuels.

"
"rachel_1401_vegetarianism_con_opening_will","1401","CON","rachel","will","Three main arguments as to why we should not necessarily adopted vegetarianism.

First let's talk about cultural validity.

So first, it's unclear why we have to respect animal rights, infinitely.

There have been multiple differences that have been pointing pointed out by philosophers that necessarily mean that even if animals qualify for some rights they definitely don't qualify to all of the rights that a human being might have.

First, they oftentimes don't carry the same level of sentience and those that do we do not eat.

But second, animals don't really have a conception of the future versus the past and of their existence in that timeline.

Rather, they have a sense of their current self and of current existence and of current biological drives but they can't actually imagine themselves in the future and they can't contextualize themselves there.

Which means when you kill an animal it's not the same as killing a human, you're not removing that animals like infinitely long life before their eyes because they couldn't conceptualize that life in the first place.

What this means is that there isn't a good reason not to kill an animal, you're not taking anything away from it and as long as you're doing so in a humane manner there isn't actually an ethical dilemma.

So, yeah, right now we have a problem with factory farming.

I'll tell you later why this problem exists on both sides of the house, but we think that this is something that we can work towards fixing and something that we can like adjust to over time, like sustainable and ethical farming.

At that point we think that people's cultures and their happiness becomes infinitely more important than this animal's life.

If this is part of your identity it can be really impact how you relate your culture and yourself to lose it.

Because recognize that for a lot of people growing up eating meat as part of cultural celebrations, as part of celebrations of yourself, or maybe it's just the meal that your mother made every night when you guys couldn't really afford anything else, all of these are valid modes of self expression and self identity.

And we think that when you like create a world in which it becomes preferable to adopt vegetarianism, you make it preferable to stop believing in these, to stop adopting to yourself.

So we think that like people should be able to have their preferences and should be able to eat meat if they so desire.

Our second area of clash has to do with ease of access and expenses, because even though it might be reasonable for someone to go vegetarian it is still incredibly difficult to make that lifestyle shift.

When you grow up with one specific diet where you know that you'll be healthy eating it and suddenly you have to switch to something completely different, we think that a lot of the times you actually run into a lot of problems with being healthy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, once you switch, because your body is very unused to the way that you are now consuming these nutrients and sometimes you're so unused to it that you don't necessarily know how to consume the same number of necessary nutrients the same way.

So we think that meat is something that most people understand how to cook, it has the same health composition that they've been living with their whole life so they can live off of diets that have meat in them without becoming unhealthy and they also exist in like most supermarkets regardless of what demographic you're living in.

And it's like very convenient for you to make, people know how to cook it and it's usually pretty cheap.

And honestly it's usually cheaper than getting enough vegetables that will keep you full in the same way.

And so we prefer that people be able to have this ease of access.

Our third area of clash has to do with the possibility of sustainability.

Because factory farming is going to exist on both sides of the house, the question is just are we factory farming animals or are we doing the same thing with vegetables, but in both worlds you're going to have real people and real animals who being harmed in the process because you don't actually change the market incentives.

In fact you're just saying, hey look now we're going to buy a crapload of this other product, you better switch to focusing on mass producing that.

So basically what they're side is creating is a world in which we can jump from trend to trend without actually solving the underlying issue.

It means that we only changed the facade without discussing more ethical ways of farming or sustainability or hydroponics.

And so we think that our side of the house is actually going to provide you a world in which we can face the actual problem.

For these reasons proud to oppose.

"tim_1401_vegetarianism_con_opening_james","1401","CON","tim","james","We should not adopt vegetarianism.

So, firstly what's important to recognize is that government defines this debate as one in which people have an obligation to adopt this type of lifestyle, to be a vegetarian, so we're going to explain firstly, why animals simply do not deserve rights, and secondly we're going to respond to some of the arguments that they make about how meat production is simply a human harm and we have to respect the rights of humans, we're going to explain why adopting vegetarianism is not the only way that this can be done, and why that means you don't have an obligation to do this.

Okay.

So firstly on animal rights.

We want to say that rights are inherently a social construct, and what we mean by this is that rights don't just come objectively out of the universe around us, they aren't just these things that ethereally exist and are applied to humanity, but rather they are constructed by societies for the purpose of utility.

Societies create these rights for the purpose of making human lives more meaningful, more valuable, and giving protections onto humans that are more fair.

So why do we think that animals should not be included in this conversation?

Well firstly, we think the whole purpose of rights is to only include those that are part of that dialogue, and even if that doesn't mean that and this doesn't mean that every single human being needs to be involved in the legislation of rights etcetera, but people themselves are ethical actors, they can pose ethical queries, and they can make ethical choices, but this simply isn't the case for animals.

For example, largely rights are based on a reciprocal nature, and what this means is that people respect my rights because I consent and I choose to protect their rights, and this is where punishment comes in, and basically every legal system in the world insofar as when I stop choosing to respect your rights, when I stop reciprocating those rights to you, then my rights become void and that is why I can be punished.

But this isn't the case for animals.

Animals have no cognitive ability to respect the rights of other people and therefore we can't hold them to the same standard, and they fall out of the frame of discussion.

Furthermore, they can't internalize rights.

So even if we were to give animals rights, we were to say we're going to ensure that all animals have these ten rights, there's no way for them to understand that rights have been placed upon them and therefore they can't internalize the value of those rights, and they can't act upon those rights.

So, given that this is the case, and furthermore that animals are just not a part of our society, they aren't a part of our social constructs.

Yes, we may have pets and then we give certain rights to those pets, but this isn't what this debate is about.

This is about whether or not farm animals deserve the same level of rights as humans, or even any sort of rights at all.

Given that animals are not part of that construct, and given that animals can't reciprocate or respond to rights in any way, we don't think that they have these types of rights.

If we think that suffering is bad and that we should prevent suffering, there's way to to do that without adopting vegetarianism, but we don't think that that is something that is meaningful about animals, it's about how we internalize and respond to animal harm, it's not about applying rights to animals themselves, and therefore we don't think you need to adopt vegetarianism because animals themselves have rights.

So finally, on meat production, responding to the government side a little bit.

We think that these harms can be alleviated in a number of other ways.

First, you can cut consumption.

So even if you want to be ethical in how you grow these meat and and what not how the amount of input that goes into meat.

You could just cut your consumption, instead of eating meat five days a week you can eat it one day a week, and that's a way to kind of help the burden that meat creates without becoming a vegetarian.

You can also increase prices as a farmer.

And finally, you can limit land allocation for the production of meat.

So if land allocation and the use of land is so inefficient and so harmful that it is harming humanity, you can create regulations to allocate only a certain amount of land for that, but none of this involves becoming a vegetarian, none of this requires vegetarianism of people, and therefore people do not have this obligation.

Because of these reasons, we should not adopt vegetarianism.

"
"james_1401_vegetarianism_pro_opening","1401","PRO","james","","We should adopt to vegetarianism.

So, this is a debate saying that individual people have an obligation to become vegetarians, to swear off eating meat, and other animal products.

So with that in mind, we have two main arguments for you: the first is about the rights of animals.

We're going to tell you that, animals are worthy of moral consideration, and that it is unethical to eat them for this reason.

Recognize that, any moral distinction between animals and humans will always be arbitrary.

Many people might say that humans deserve more consideration than animals, because they're more intelligent, but this clearly isn't always true.

We see that, an adult dolphin, for instance, is much more able than a baby human to make certain decisions.

The other side might retort that, no one eats dolphins, but the point is that we do eat animals that are very intelligent, like octopus, and that on top of that, all animals clearly would prefer not to be in pain, rather than to be in pain.

We think that, this is indicative of some level of intelligence, and that we ought to respect these wishes.

In the same way that we don't force people to do things, that make them uncomfortable whenever possible, we view those as moral harms, we ought not force animals to do these things.

And recognize that, it's not just the act of eating the animal that causes so much suffering.

We think that, you know oftentimes it's possible to kill an animal painlessly, so they don't understand what's going on.

But the industry that supports the creation of meat, for our consumption, is deeply unethical.

We see that, you have chickens who were born into tiny cages, that are barely larger than they are, and then kept in dark buildings for their entire lives.

They grow so fat, that they can't walk around, and that are pumped full of chemicals, which prevent them from developing in a normal way.

We think that, it's extremely troubling that society is completely willing to overlook the horrifying, frankly, treatment of animals in the meat industry, in order to continue to satisfy a basic human instinct to eat meat.

We think that, people have an obligation to overcome these baser instincts, in order to respect the moral considerations of others, even if those others have hooves or feathers.

So because animals are deserving of moral consideration, because they're living things with preferences, we should become vegetarians, rather than continue to exploit them.

Our second argument, even if you don't care about animals, is about the environment, and I think it's clear that if you care about human beings as moral actors, that you'll care about this.

Realize that, the production of meat is tremendously resource intensive.

If you imagine a big pyramid, and let's say that there's a million calories worth of corn at the bottom of the pyramid, so, corn plants produce a million calories worth of food.

Every time you go up a level of the food chain, ninety percent of those calories are lost.

So, we go from a million levels at the bottom, to a hundred thousand calories, at the next level, at the cow level, to ten thousand calories at the human level.

That's all humans are receiving is ten thousand, because ninety percent of the calories are lost at every level, because digestion is inefficient, and because animals and plants consume a certain amount of calories as you move up the food chain.

So what we see is that, whereas you could feed ten times as many people, with an acre of land producing corn for human consumption, you feed only one tenth as many, if an acre of land is devoted to corn for cattle's consumption.

So ultimately, we think that in a world where people are starving, in a world where too much land is devoted to agriculture, and it's destroying our environment, that it is deeply unethical for posterity, and for people starving right now, to eat meat.

But, we also see that the environmental degradation, caused by the monoculture of corn and crops used to feed the livestock, is deeply devastating for the environment, and is causing irreversible damage, which means that future people, who we think deserve equal consideration with current people, are going to live in a worse environment, so that we can eat chicken nuggets.

For these reasons, we should adopt vegetarianism.

Thank you.

"
"will_1401_vegetarianism_pro_opening","1401","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt vegetarianism.

As a model we want to establish that this is a debate about whether or not it would be preferable for society to voluntarily accept this diet change.

We're not going to implement policies that would force people to become vegetarians, rather we just think that this is a preferable lifestyle choice for people to make on an individual level, but especially on a societal level in aggregation.

Our first independent point is animal rights.

So we think that animal rights stem from just sort of like a pain like a like a suffering slash like happiness perspective that if there is suffering in the world it is bad regardless of where that suffering comes from and we think that intelligence-based you know frameworks of whether or not something has rights are inherently elitist.

At that point then if it is important to respect animal rights, there is obviously a need to become vegetarian, insofar as vegetarianism one reduce eliminates the moral complicity in the suffering of animals of factory farming.

These are obviously pretty extreme forms of suffering.

Chickens that are kept in tight coops for example or cows that are given or really any livestock that isn't given sufficient space, but also the way in which they are systemically executed.

If you think life has any intrinsic value this is bad but also the ways in which the animals are killed are often brutal and gruesome.

At that point then we think that there is a moral imperative to reduce your complicity in it.

But secondly when you have a society of vegetarians you obviously eliminate the demand for this product in the first place and as a result there is a tangible change in whether or not it happens because nobody actually is buying the products that facilitate the suffering in the first place.

Our second independent point is environmental impacts.

We think first that livestock is an inefficient use of land and water that just growing produce is just a better way to use this because it you know demands less from the system.

That in turn means that there are less things contributing to droughts and other resource shortages but other that there is less also that there is less over farming of land that you you know don't deplete soil in the way that you do when you have it you know actually like just absolutely mutilated by livestock.

In that sense then you have a infrastructure for food that is more capable of sustaining large populations at affordable rates.

That's important for things like global hunger but it's also important at a local level for insuring that people's you know expenditures on foods food is lower.

Beyond this though, in terms of the local environment, we also think that there's a significant impact on global warming created by the agricultural industry.

Methane for example that's like common in just like general biological waste generated by livestock is a significant contributing factor to emission that drive global warming.

As such then we think it is important to mitigate the extent to which livestock are actually bred and born in which in turn then contributes to global warming.

Our third independent point is health of the individual.

So we think that just being a vegetarian is a healthier lifestyle.

Red meat in particular is you know there are plethora of studies demonstrating that red meat is carcinogenic.

We also think that you know this meat is often laden with fat and other you know harmful ingredients that just aren't particularly healthy.

And beyond just the individual benefits of being healthy, you know longer lifespan, happier lifestyle, you know the mental impacts of just being healthy there's also larger societal impacts for example decreased healthcare costs which actually have a ripple effect across all of society because no longer do you have a system that requires healthy individuals to subsidize comparatively less healthy individuals.

That in turn means a society that spends less on healthcare costs and more on other things that are presumably you know good uses of your money when you don't have to spend it on healthcare.

Also there's just less suffering now because less people are unhealthy and have to get healthcare in the first place for things like heart conditions.

Proud to propose.

"
"will_1542_libertarian_con_opening_daniel","1542","CON","will","daniel","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion, that we should adopt libertarianism.

I think generally speaking, the way the gov approached this was to say: here is a high level reason why tyranny of the majority is bad.

I don't think though, that that justifies abolition of a lot of important public resources, that are important to minimizing suffering in the world.

Given this, I think that you can basically say: okay, here's some really bad things, that happened in the status quo, but generally speaking, democracy should solve for that.

Generally speaking, the government does more good than harm, and what I want to talk to you about is the ways in which the government reduces suffering, by having the sort of infrastructure that gov would get rid of.

First, we would say that redistributive taxation, and redistributive policies in general, are good.

Secondly, we would say that regulations are good, and third, we would say that public resources, that are accessible to all, are good.

First on redistributive policies.

We think, in the world, there are haves and have-nots.

This is true, because it's probably, honestly, exacerbated on their side of the house, but there are people who are poor, there are people who are not poor, and when you are born to someone who is poor, you are also poor.

This is the lottery of birth.

It's not that people who are poor are intrinsically worth less, but they suffer more, because of a lack of resources.

We think then, that it is justified for the government to engage in policies, that take from the rich, the haves, and give to the poor, the have-nots.

This is for, really, two reasons.

The first is that equity decreases that suffering.

Suffering doesn't exist on a linear scale, that is, if you pump a bunch of money into a rich person's pocket, they don't suddenly do that much better.

That's because they'll generally spend it on things that aren't really important to quality of life, in the way that things like healthcare, or other basic things, are.

They'll spend it on things, like a nice car a nice house.

But secondly, we think that diminishing marginal returns, an important concept of economics, also apply to income.

So, when I have lots of disposable money, it's not worth as much to me, because the diminishing marginal returns, on the individual dollars that I have, are less and less, the more I have.

We think equalizing the playing field means the most utility, because people get the most bang for their buck, they value it the most.

Our second independent point is that regulations are good, because it protects the weak from the powerful.

On side government, you get rid of the regulations that prevent really bad things, like pollution, and price gouging, things like that, things where a third party is harmed, but the person engaging in the bad action doesn't have an incentive to just not do it on their own act.

This makes for an inherently worse world.

You create things that increase net suffering, because the individual people engaging in these problematic actions don't have a force pushing against them, to say: don't do this thing, that makes the world significantly worse.

Our third independent point is that public resources are good, that there are things that we should all have equal access to, because they're facilitative to basic quality of life.

I think a good example of this is roads, or sidewalks, things that are important for us getting from point a to point b.

But, if the government relinquishes control of these types of things, it they privatize roads, and things like that, just like a lot of really really like very libertarian people would like to see, then you have a lot of harms for the people that need that, to get from point a to point b.

I think you wind up putting a lot of money into the pockets of people that already have money, and siphoning it off of the people that need these public resources, in order to do things like get to their work, or get to a hospital, or all these other things.

When you privatize out these services, you make life very very difficult for people, that don't have the means to deal with the private sector.

I think that's a significant problem, and I think that it leads to a lot of suffering.

Look, I understand the sort of philosophical justifications that are given by government.

I don't think though, that they reconcile with the intense suffering that is created, by the realization of these high level philosophical ideas.

Proud to oppose.

"
"sam_1542_libertarian_con_opening_will","1542","CON","sam","will","I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should adopt libertarianism.

There are few political ideologies as fundamentally misconstrued and as fundamentally mischampioned as libertarianism.

It is a system which favors the rich and the powerful.

Although the adoption of libertarianism in many ways seems like the adoption of natural forms of power, natural ways of thinking, we would say that all that it does is create a vacuum, where the presently rich and powerful can decide literally every rule that they want for themselves with incredibly little government oversight.

One overview before three reasons why we should not adopt libertarianism.

My overview is very simply that in any western liberal democracy where this kind of debate would ever be possible, the alternatives are liberty and democracy.

Without adopting libertarianism, we can easily adopt a system where every individual gets a say in the government.

Where there's not profound amounts of gerrymandering or abuse, and where there is ample amounts of government intervention and regulation.

In this speech I'm going to show why it is essential that we have the social benefits of government regulation and control, that we need to solve profoundly problematic collective action problems, and thirdly, how the powerful can never regulate themselves.

First off, on social benefits.

The most obvious way in which libertarianism can exert itself in the united states, or a variety of other western liberal governments, is by the immediate removal of social benefits and taxes.

We would say things like welfare, unemployment, social security, are essential in the status quo for helping people survive.

Many people who have already retired could not buy food, housing, any of the necessities, if not for social security.

But even if we only have this debate in the abstract rather than having a debate about the specific people who would literally starve as a result of this policy, we would say that every government has people at the lowest end of society who due to genetic factors, due to historical factors, have been pushed to the bottom and cannot afford the basic necessities.

If the government refuses to provide them, no one else will.

We see that in the status quo, there's already incredible difficulty getting private industry to actually invest in the poorest people in society.

They typically do it because the capitalist incentive of having a tax benefit is also there, and because it's good for PR.

In a system where the government has signaled that social benefits and social welfare are not a key interest and that there is no benefits to corporations, we think that this would also fall.

And at that point, the poorest individuals would have no ability to essentially feed themselves, which is the greatest harm that can be actualized upon them due to government action.

Now, the second argument is that this creates profound collective action problems.

We think things like roads, we think essential emergency services must be solved through collective action.

The alternative is private individuals creating toll roads, decreasing the efficiency of entire societies, creating police forces and fire services, first, making it so they have total power to control individuals by literally refusing them lifesaving services, and secondly, by refusing the poor these services, making their lives even more difficult.

Even in the status quo, it is incredibly expensive to be poor.

And at the point where powerful individuals can charge even more to poor families, we think that the system is fundamentally unjust.

My third argument is the idea of regulation.

You cannot trust individuals to police themselves.

This has been seen throughout history, most recently in the financial sector with two two thousand eight financial crisis, and we think that adopting libertarianism is just giving the power to the individuals who must be policed overall.

We think this leads to inevitable economic destruction such as in two thousand eight, level of abuses by the powerful, and a system which is essentially a vacuum where other powerful actors can take the reins to the harm of all society.

For this reason, we should not adopt libertarianism.

"
"will_1542_libertarian_pro_opening","1542","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt libertarianism.

Three independent points, but first a quick model.

We would say that this is, you know, something we are adopting in terms of a governmental structure, so specifically a governmental structure that necessitates less involvement of the state into personal affairs.

This means, you know, everything from lower taxes and less regulations all the way down to, you know, less involvement in shaping social policy, like what constitutes marriage.

We'd endure, say, wide array of policies underneath this framework, but broadly we're going to defend the notion that government should just do less essentially, and a private citizen should be making more decisions about what happens to them rather than the government making those decisions for them.

The first independent point that I really just broadly want to establish is why these principles matter, that autonomy, on an individual level, is something that's really, really important.

So, the majority of our constructs of what constitute our rights is derived from autonomy being the principal thing that we care about.

Even something as fundamental as our right to life is only based on the fact that we, you know, have a life where we can make decisions about what happens to us and, you know, what freedoms we have.

That autonomy and that liberty is really fundamental to our entire perception of what constitutes a right.

So this is something that we should always take with, you know, to the the highest extreme essentially, that we always want to establish as much autonomy for the individual as is reasonably possible.

There will always be constraints on that, for example, we shouldn't give them autonomy to murder.

But even then, we would only say that the, you know, the reason that you don't want people to be allowed to murder is so because doing so actually restricts other people's autonomy.

In another sense, what we really want to do is maximize autonomy, on net, for as many people as possible.

I think that, broadly speaking, libertarianism accomplishes that by ensuring that the government has as little a role in people's lives as is possible.

The second point that I want to bring up, though, is that the government is a bad proxy for making these decisions for people.

So I think a lot of the defense that will come out of side opposition in favor of big government will be that, you know, regulations, like food safety regulations and things like that, are effective at ensuring that people are protected from predatory practices and things like that that limit their autonomy by establishing harms upon them.

The problem is that individuals are really the best actors for these things.

They know best.

And when you try to proxy their preferences through bureaucracy, essentially, there's always going to be inefficiencies intrinsic to that, that the bureaucracy just isn't good at figuring out what that individual person wants and isn't in a position to make those decisions intelligently for them.

So this ranges from everything to, you know, regulations being bad, something like, you know, a regulation on a auto producer not being able to put a certain feature in a car or having to wear seat belts, when in reality that's just something that an individual person can decide if they want to buy something with seat belts or not based on their personal preferences.

But also social policy, where the government intervenes into things like gay marriage or trans rights, simply on the basis of the the social mores of the society around them, but in reality, this isn't something that society should be deciding.

This is something that the individual should be deciding insofar as it most directly affects them.

So we would say that when these regulations come down from the upper level at the government, that's necessarily problematic.

The third and final point I want to make very briefly is just that people really, at a principled level, should be responsible for themselves.

I don't think that there's a positive obligation for an individual to support another through redistributive economics, for example.

And the reason for this is that, you know, we derive our, you know, our humanity and our and our sense of worth from the autonomy over our property or things, and because those those that property is facilitative to us being able to, you know, exert our own preferences, I if I want a car, if I want to drive around a lot because that makes me happy, I need the, you know, the money to buy a car.

And I think if we do the work to get that money and if we earn that capital, that property has to belong to us.

It's unjust then when the government takes it away.

Proud to propose.

"
"daniel_1542_libertarian_pro_opening","1542","PRO","daniel","","We should adopt libertarianism because it is both morally and practically the correct thing to do.

So, let's start by talking about what we mean by adopting libertarianism.

So, we're going to get rid of everything that is possible to get rid of as far as government services are concerned.

So what does this mean?

We're going to have only basic safety services, so things like fire and the police.

The police should be smaller than it is now as should the military.

You shouldn't get involved in international conflicts or things like that.

Basic health and safety services.

So, obviously you're gonna have to have some degree of public health to make sure that people can stay healthy and third, laws and basic legal structures to make sure that there's a way to mediate disputes between people through like a public system.

So you wanna have a public body of laws.

All of these basic things are going to be done is minimally as possible and that's how it's going to happen.

Everything else - gone.

All regulations - gone.

Everything gone.

So, let's talk about why this is just the way that we should that that things have to be.

So first I think that this is the only way to ensure that people are able to maximize their individual conceptions about the best way to live their lives.

So here's the problem: pretty much everyone in society disagrees on a lot of things.

Some people agree but by and large most people don't agree on just about everything, and the problem is is that one of the things that it's intrinsic to government interference is that it controls the way in which people can live their lives.

So every time the government passes a regulation, every time the government passes a ban or every time the government gives out a subsidy, it's directing some kind of, it's doing some kind of preference and this is going to be at the expense of some other kind of person.

So I think that this is deeply unjust because you can't just simply say that a majority of people is enough to justify the government depriving someone in some way.

For example, if the majority wants to take away someone's right to have a like gay marriage with somebody or if the or if the majority wants to spend its money on, or if the majority wants to like spend his money on something stupid, like subsidizing like like a mission to mars or whatever.

Some some like random thing like if the government wants to spend like a billion dollars on something.

These are things in which it has an impact on people.

And this is a problem because the counterbalancing solution is that you can just not spend in all these things.

People can have their own money and they can spend it on what they want to do.

And I think this is also going to be much better because this means you're going to minimize rights violations.

I think that when you take away people's property or you prevent them from exercising their autonomy in ways in which they choose, this is akin to theft.

Its theft in that you steal someone's money and you are doing what you want with it because you think that it's going to be better.

Here's the problem: just because you think that this money is going to go towards better use or just because you think a band or a regulation is going to be good for society, doesn't mean that you have a right to do that.

Because how it's best the live a life is ultimately up to the individual.

Some people may think that it's better to be free than to be like health you're safe.

That's why some people may choose to do drugs or eat unhealthy even if there's consequences about that.

People are autonomous rational beings with like free will, they can make their own choices.

That's the best way in which people can be happiest and live the lives that want to.

But finally, I think that this is going to be most efficient and effective.

And the reason for that is because I think that individual people know how to spend our money better than the government.

They know how to spend their money better than the government because if they want something then they can pay for it.

If they don't want something they don't have to pay for it.

, if they value something then they can support it.

And what this does is ultimately it makes sure that things that exist exist because individuals value them.

So for all those reasons we should adopt libertarianism.

We say that if we show you that by canceling school uniform, we're going to create a situation that will make it a lot harder for certain students to fit in and to feel welcome, then with all due respect to the feeling of individuality of the children, it can wait until after hour after school hours.

The second thing that we're being told is that school uniforms aren't comfortable enough.

I'm sorry but this is not a serious argument.

I mean, come on.

If this is the problem, we can easily solve it by allowing a few possible versions of the uniform, you know, short sleeve, long sleeve, etcetera, and each student can simply choose the version that's most comfortable for him.

Again, with all due respect, this is not so important.

Lastly, we hear that there is no positive impact that comes out of school uniform and that it's all just assertions.

But seeing as this was basically said as an assertion itself, without any analysis, I find it a little funny.

So, let's move on to explain the positive impact of uniform.

We say that children can be pretty cruel sometimes, especially to whoever is different from them.

There are a few ways in which you can be different.

It can be on the basis of appearance: if I am overweight, if the color of my skin is different, it can be in my religion or my sexual orientation and, obviously, it can be in socioeconomic status.

If my parents don't have enough money to send me to school in fancy clothing like the rest of the children then, in the worst case scenario, I might actually be subjected to social preclusion.

But even if not, I start to develop a sense of inferiority.

I feel uncomfortable in my own skin.

This is a feeling that accompanies me everywhere, including into the classroom, and I just simply cannot run away from.

We say that if it is possible to at least allow these children the chance of, you know, getting free from all of this, from this feeling of inferiority, at least while they're in the school where they are supposed to be able to sit in the classroom and study and to focus and concentrate without feeling unwelcome, without having to worry about their social status.

We say that if we could do something about it, then this is something that we must do, and by implementing the school uniform, we say that at least we are giving them the chance of being released from all of this.

Therefore, we call you to oppose the motion.

"
"will_1661_school-uniforms_con_opening_james","1661","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should abandon school uniforms.

Our first independent point is that school uniforms create a sense of unity and community.

We think that particularly for younger children this is, but children in general, that this sense of community and the sense of structure is important.

Children early in their lives need structure not just for the social benefits associated with it, like being able to develop more wholly in a scenario in which you you know feel secure and feel stable, but also because it's facilitative to your learning.

That is that when you feel that there is a sense of structure in your life then you feel that you are more capable of learning, your more capable of focusing on your academics.

We think furthermore that the sense of community created by that shared uniform creates an environment that is more facilitative to learning, but also brings the social benefits associated with being in a community.

That is closeness with individuals who have shared experiences with you.

We think that this is particularly important because people are naturally inclined to form communities anyway, so we think that when school uniforms create a sense of community that naturally draws people from the same school together, it prevents them from forming communities based on more arbitrary and problematic lines, like say race or socioeconomic status.

At that point then we think that that we create communities that are in a sense more arbitrary, less likely to be based on biases and more likely to be based on something that's relatively unimportant like the fact that you go to school together.

Our second independent point is that it signals school as a unique environment.

What we mean by this is that we want school to be seen by people who go to school as a place would you go to learn and probably not much else.

We think that most socialization and things like that will often happen outside of the classroom.

In the classroom, we want people to be focused on learning because learning is so important.

It's a facilitative right in the sense that you are often incapable of performing your roles in a democracy without proper information, and you're often incapable of getting things like gainful employment, and by extension the other rights that are afforded by monetary income, unless you have a proper education.

And of course a proper education is contingent upon you, you know, being present in the classroom mentally and actually learning things.

We think that if we have a uniform that actually associates you know what you're wearing essentially with where you are, it creates the signal to children that school is not a place where you know you wear your casual clothes and you do the things that you do when you're wearing your casual clothes.

We think that what someone's wearing has a very strong effect on one state of mind.

That we for example behave more professionally when were wearing professional clothing, regardless of whether or not we're in a professional environment.

Given that we think that uniforms are uniquely beneficial to ensuring that people associate school with a time of focusing on learning.

Our third and final independent point is that this mitigates particular types of outfits that can be disruptive to that learning environment.

So even if I myself am wearing clothing that's relatively appropriate for school, we think it's quite likely that others might not be.

I don't want to lean into sort of like the arguments that gov talks about in terms of sexism.

We're obviously not going to say that school uniforms should like enforce like these strict sexual codes.

What we think instead is like, for example, like graphic tee shirts that like depict acts of violence are like radical political positions, we want to ensure that those sorts of things don't work their way into school hallways.

Not just because these can have particular harms such as like hate speech, but also because we think that they're generally disruptive to the learning environment.

That this clothing is both visually distracting and it separates the sense of being in school from the sense of being in a more social environment, and a such we think it mitigates the ability of an individual to focus on their learning when they're in school.

Proud to oppose.

"
"james_1661_school-uniforms_pro_opening","1661","PRO","james","","We should ban school uniforms.

So, by ban school uniforms what we're really talking about, is we think that in places like britain, where right now school children are required to all dress in the same outfit everyday, we should do away with that practice and let children dress themselves within reason.

We're okay with things like dress codes, you know, requiring skirts to come to the knee, or requiring that everyone tuck their shirt in, things like that, but we don't think that a school should tell children exactly how to dress.

So, two arguments: first we're going to explain to you why we think this policy is bad for children, and second we're going to talk about potential benefits of uniforms, but why we don't think they're the most important thing.

So why are uniforms bad for children?

First of all we think that they stifle creativity.

Recognize that young people can experiment with their identity and how they want to act in a relatively low cost way while they're in secondary school.

So if they want to try dressing up like people from different subcultures or experimenting with different looks, they can do that and it won't affect their ability to get a job later in life.

We think that everyone is pretty sympathetic to the idea that teenagers in particular don't really know what kind of people they want to be yet and want to try out lots of different ways of acting.

So when you have uniforms you stifle the ability for children to experiment in this low cost setting what type of person they want to be.

We think that this will lead to them having to figure these things out later in life, determine if they want to be part of a certain subculture or how they want to dress, and ultimately that they will have higher cost then in terms of their ability to gain employment.

But we also think that young people don't learn how to dress if you give them a uniform.

There's nothing more frustrating than being told to show up to an event business casual if you don't know what that means.

We think that when young people have to dress themselves for school, they learn skills like this, how to dress professionally, how to dress for certain events, but they don't learn that as well if they have to wear uniforms because they dress the same every day and to have to put any thought into it.

So we think that uniforms, by removing the requirement to think about clothes, actually create an unrealistic expectation for young people about what the world is like because how you dress absolutely does matter socially and professionally and young people aren't learning to think about it if they wear school uniforms.

Next, although this next issue might sound marginal we think the harms to the people it affects are very great.

Recognize that school uniforms really enforce the gender binary, so if you have people who don't identify with the sex that they were assigned at birth, we think it's going to be very difficult for those people to have to wear school uniforms.

If you give people some freedom about how to dress they can choose to subvert the sex they were signed at birth and experiment with their gender identity and things like that, but you can't do that if you have to wear a school uniform.

If your school tells you that boys have to wear trousers and girls have to wear skirts and you're transgender, you have no way to get around this policy.

And we think that that's likely to be very stifling for these people, and while there may be relatively few transgender people, we think that the harms of gender dysphoria are so great and the costs of letting children dress themselves are so little, that clearly we should defer to this concern.

And lastly in terms of a financial burden, I'm sure that the other team is going to get up here and say that schools can pay for the uniforms of children who can't afford them, but there's no such thing as a free lunch.

Somebody is ultimately paying for these school uniforms.

And recognize that young people can't wear these uniforms outside of school, they're normally not really fit for playing in, or working, and things like that.

So this basically requires low income students have extra sets of clothes.

And even if their parents don't have to pay for them directly, which they probably do in some areas, but even if they don't, this is just another big cost for the state to take on in providing education and we'd rather spend that money on other things instead.

So our second part of the speech is how we think that the alleged benefits are outweighed.

Even if uniforms offer some discipline in classrooms, we don't think that this is unique to schools with uniforms.

There are plenty of american or german schools where people don't wear uniforms and still have good classroom discipline.

So we think that it's more important to instill discipline than to teach people that they have to wear a uniform.

Next, even if uniforms remove some bullying they don't remove it all.

We think that children are always going to be unkind to one another and requiring them to wear uniforms won't uniquely stop this or get rid of the problem.

And even if uniforms create some sense of unity within a school, we think that there are still going to be lots of ways young people are excluded.

We think that you're likely to see some people are popular and others aren't, we think you're likely see racism and bias and things like that remain, so ultimately you're not going to create this strong sense of unity through using uniforms.

So while certainly there are some benefits: you probably do get a little more discipline, you probably do limit some bullying, we think that the harms that we expressed earlier are more important than these concerns, so we should ban school uniforms.

"
"daniel_1661_school-uniforms_pro_opening","1661","PRO","daniel","","We should ban school uniforms, because they ultimately have a good amount of good for the students, they create good in the fact that it gives students an outlet to express their creativity, their individuality and their preferences, and it creates good in that it allows students to just wear clothing that is more comfortable for them, more fitting for them, like better for them, which I also which I think makes them like better students even in a lot of ways actually.

So let's start by talking about the first thing, the creativity.

Because I think that it's important that when we look at students, especially given that schools aren't purely academic atmosphere, that they have social elements to them as well.

Students want to be able to express themselves, they want to express their individuality, they want to express what they like, what they don't like, things like that.

These are, for what it's worth and worth noting, constitutional protections that a lot of students have in places like america to express their speech in that way.

And I think that there's like a true value to that, when everyone just wearing the same, when everyone just looks the same and is wearing the same things, you don't really feel like you're able to express yourselves, you feel like one of just like a mob, and that's just not something that people like, and that's a harm already.

The next thing I'm going to talk about, though, is about comfort.

So, I think that just oftentimes school uniforms aren't particularly comfortable, they're not the kind of clothes that maybe people are comfortable in different kinds of clothing, and I think that that's actually important to note, because a lot of people just work better or more able to focus when they're wearing things that are comfortable, like I'm much better able to work when I'm wearing pajamas than I'm wearing a suit, which I think is uncomfortable, I'm better able to focus.

There's plenty of people who feel like that, a lot of students, especially when you're younger, are very likely to have focus in this way.

Being comfortable is also better, you don't want to be wearing like like a thick thing if it's like bothering, shorter shorts if it's sweating if it's like hot out or you're sweating and things like that, like these are basic things and but they are nevertheless important things.

So, the next thing is I want to just like weigh all of that against the fact, compare it all to the fact that there is no real positive impact for uniforms.

Like first and foremost, recognize that this is about uniforms, not dress code, so obviously a lot of the more extreme harms that people could talk about on the other side are not actually all that important, it's just like hyperbole.

But the final thing that I want to talk about, is about like a lot of the lies that are associated with other things, like wearing certain types of clothes is not a distraction, there's no real evidence of that, wearing certain kind of clothing doesn't make you like focus any better, or you get things like that.

These are ultimately just unfounded assertions, and it shouldn't be valued very heavily.

So, for all of those reasons, very proud to propose.

"
"tim_1902_ivory-trade_con_opening_will","1902","CON","tim","will","We should not legalize ivory trade.

In this debate we're going to make two broad arguments that are strongly connected.

The first is about animal rights and why we think that animal rights do exist and why they ought to exist.

And the second second argument is about why legalizing the ivory trade would violate those rights would be an immoral act and it would expand harm to animals that should be protected.

Right so on animal rights we think that rights need to be based on some sort of objective standard in order to be prescriptive.

What we mean by this is that if rights are something that you can just change based on your perspective or change based on your subjective preference than these rights don't have any strong binding power.

In order for these rights to be binding they need to be based on something that's objective something that isn't based on person from one person to the next but something that remains constant throughout all actors that the rights apply to.

The way that we do this in reality is by weighing pain versus pleasure.

The way that we ascribe rights is we find something that provides an immense amount of pain to an individual or immense amount of pain to something and we make it so that there's a right that prevents that pain from being ascribed in that pain and because that pain would so totally outweigh any sort of pleasure that could come from it and so we should ascribe rights based on those who experienced pain and pleasure.

This means that animals specifically elephants that the ivory is coming from should be covered under our system of rights.

Why is this the case.

Because if we choose a different standard then we're doing so arbitrarily so that we can exclude animals.

When the fact of how we ascribe rights is based on this principle.

This principle that we should minimize pain and maximize pleasure.

Those rights should be ascribed and prescribed onto all sentient beings that can feel pain and pleasure.

Ivory requires the hunting and maiming of elephants causing an immense amount of pain.

We think the right to life is a basic right something that even if you don't believe that animals should have full rights this is a right that they should have and any distinction to work around this would be arbitrary.

So let's talk about how this law expands harm to animals.

Legalizing the ivory trade inevitably leads to increased desire for it.

Ivory already has a precious reputation.

There's already an immense black market that exists in regard to ivory.

We think that if you make it legal you could you make it easier for people to sell it to put it out on the open market and to make a profit off of it they're also much more likely to go and become poachers or to hire poachers to get higher ivory for them or poachers are just going to spring up on their own.

Regardless we think that when you when you make it easier to sell when you make it much easier to find a market for consumers but make it much easier to distribute to the market when you make it much easier to have possession of ivory in the first place all things that are made it very difficult because of the ivory laws that exist in the status quo you make the market larger.

More hunters and poachers go after these animals because business is just more lucrative.

This is likely to lead to extinction of elephants.

In the status quo elephants are already a breed that is in the endangered species list and elephants don't bear enough children every year they have long gestation periods and only bear one or two children at any given time this means that if you increase the hunting numbers of elephants you're very likely to get to a point where they become extinct because you simply cannot replace them in the environment quickly enough.

We think this is clearly immoral.

This law only considers human short term utility over the long term utility of elephants and because those elephants can feel pain and feel pleasure they deserve to have their rights respected.

For these reasons we should not legalize ivory trade.

"
"tim_1902_ivory-trade_con_opening_yaar","1902","CON","tim","yaar","We should not legalize ivory trade.

In the status quo there is an issue, a major issue that faces rhinos and elephants of different species in that many elephant and rhino species are going extinct.

The reason for this is that ivory is an incredibly valuable asset and an incredibly valuable resource in many countries seen for both communal uses, for medical uses of different types in different sort of homeopathic remedies, but also just for the value of the material itself for jewelry and things like this.

So ivory's incredibly valuable on the world market and it has led to a dramatic decline in elephant and rhino populations.

Which is actually very important for those species in particular because the breeding periods I know of elephants is a very long time, and for rhinos it's similarly long, the gestation it takes a long time for populations of these types of species to grow back.

So when these species are endangered, it makes it even more likely that they could go extinct in the future.

So firstly we're going to talk about animal rights and why yet animals deserve rights and why and why this is so crucial about legalizing ivory trade.

Why it would be bad for those respects.

So why do animals deserve rights?

We think in order for rights to be effective, they need to be objective.

That is in order for a system of rights to be coherent and to protect in a way that is unbiased and isn't perspectival, which means it protects broadly no matter what the perspective is that you're taking, it allows that we can make objective judgments about right and wrong.

In order for this to be to be the case, there needs to be some sort of foundation on which these rights exist.

And it can't simply be humanity unless we give good reasons why humanity is the line that needs to be drawn for giving rights.

But we think that this is rather rather subjective in that we're only giving it to humans because we are humans.

There isn't on any other basis besides that.

We think that a much better reason to give rights is on the basis of pain and pleasure.

The reason for this is that rights ultimately come down to trying to minimize pain and enact more pleasure.

When we talk about rights to life, rights to speech, rights to bodily autonomy, all these are for reasons of trying to minimize pain when you get to the very bottom of it, when you ask why is it important to protect these rights?

You enter into an infinite regress of answers until it comes to that simple point.

In given that that's what we're trying to do with rights, we should give it on the basis of whether or not these things can feel pain and pleasure.

And in the instance of animals that produce ivory, the answer is resoundingly yes.

These animals can not only experience pain or pleasure, but also have human like emotions.

They can experience sadness, they can know that a threat is coming and respond to it, they can experience fear, all of these types of things that we would say are human are experiences and emotions that these animals can have.

So even if you think that pain and pleasure isn't the basis, if you think it's consciousness, or things like this, the ability to have human like interactions, these animals often form human like communities with hierarchies and different types of social understandings between groups, even if they're not advanced.

So we clearly think that animals, especially elephants and rhinos, advanced intelligent animals, deserve rights.

The problem with this is that if you legalize the ivory trade, you are almost certainly going to ensure that there's an expansion in hunting.

When it's legalized to hunt these animals, when it's legalize to trade these types of things, even if you don't legalize the hunting itself, it means that sport is going to become far more common and it's already very difficult to look at these to observe and protect these animals from these things because of the wide areas in which these animals may roam and the ability for hunters to go undetected.

It's difficult to regulate these things and when the black market can operate in the open, it means that it's easier to get these types of these types of goods, but it also means that there's a greater demand for these goods.

So even if it can be better observed and better monitored if you bring it into a legal market, it means that the demands for these goods is going to go up so dramatically that you're almost certainly going to see hunters and poachers attack these the these animals in new numbers.

Given that these animals deserve the right to life based on the principles of pain and pleasure, we don't think that you should legalize the ivory trade, because it would ultimately lead almost certainly to their extinction.

And given all this we should not legalize the ivory trade.

"
"will_1902_ivory-trade_pro_opening","1902","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize the ivory trade.

The model is simple.

We will allow stockpiles only to be sold that is confiscated ivory by countries in which the ivory trade is obviously you know fairly prevalent.

So for example kenya, in the central african republic, have large stockpiles of ivory we will allow them to sell those stockpiles but we are not going to legalize a, sale by non-government actors or b, the actual process of getting ivory from animals in the first place.

Three independent points.

First, this generates income for poor nations.

Most of the nations that are on the front lines of battling the ivory trade are disproportionately poor african nations.

These are weak states that often have difficulty collecting reliable tax revenue and as such have a very small apparatus for actually responding to the front lines of the ivory trade.

The problem we have with the ivory trade is that animals are harmed in the process and as such the most important link to sever is the link where in animal poachers actually extract ivory from rhinos and elephants.

Lacking the infrastructure to enforce anti-poaching laws means that these poor states are often left unequipped to do the most important job of stopping this problematic trade.

If you allow them however to sell off this ivory and generate income that way, then they're able to redirect those funds into actually like stamping down on the poaching itself.

That is the most problematic aspect of the trade.

Our second independent point is that this policy undercuts the black market.

Countries can sell at a low selling point that is significantly lower than the market already solves for.

So if a certain amount of ivory is worth a hundred dollars on the black market, a state actor can undercut them for a lower amount of money say, ninety dollars for that same amount and as such get a larger amount of interested buyers and cut out the black market from a significant portion of their sales.

This in turn means that those who actually do the poaching are crowded out of the market.

Smugglers are likely to leave the profession as are poachers once they have no smugglers to sell to.

This in turn ensures that as you engage in this policy you can essentially crowd out the market from its own industry and in essence kill the demand for actually hunting down these animals in the first place.

Our third independent point and probably most fundamental, is that it reduces the demand for ivory.

The reason why this is true is that you can target sales to lower class individuals.

Most of the demand for ivory right now is driven by a burgeoning chinese middle class that sees ivory as a status symbol.

This in turn drives the incredible amount that is brought into china.

I think like forty percent or possibly even sixty percent of the global ivory trade ends in china.

So at that point then, if you are able to target sales of ivory to lower income individuals and proliferate ownership of ivory among the lower class, you kill the status of ivory as a status symbol.

In essence, what this does is ensure that there isn't as much demand for ivory in the first place because if the middle class doesn't want it then the trend dies and over time the lower class is less interested in it as well.

That intern ensures that there's nobody buying it from the smugglers, who in turn will not buy it from the poachers, who in turn will move to other industries in order to ensure that they are you know making money because ivory doesn't have that money anymore.

As such, a government actor is uniquely positioned to restructure the market to collapse the market.

Proud to propose.

"
"yaar_1902_ivory-trade_pro_opening","1902","PRO","yaar","","We should legalize ivory trade.

So on the one side of the scales in this debate, we have the possible extinction of endangered elephants in africa and on the other, we have massive financial benefits to some of the poorest countries in the world.

In this speech, we're going to argue the following: a, the latter is simply more important than the former, and b: even if not, banning ivory trade does very little to help protect the elephants, even the opposite and so we might as well, at the very least, try and make the most out of it and guarantee that the money is reaching the right place.

First argument: so we were all taught how important it is to protect endangered species, but we would actually challenge this notion and dare ask, why is it so important?

What's the intrinsic value of african elephants being able to walk around safely?

Surely, it can't be about animal rights since we generally don't mind slaughtering billions of animals each passing day, just so we can enjoy eating meat or dairy or wearing fur or leather.

What's so different about wanting to enjoy the use of ivory?

So, we think that apart from vague sentimental values, there's just not a lot to say for the importance of protecting africa's elephants.

On the other hand, however, the potential benefit that can come out of ivory trade is huge.

The main countries that stand to gain a lot from this are countries like zimbabwe or botswana and the like.

These are incredibly poor countries that can't possibly create a competitive advantage for themselves in the industry or agriculture sectors because this would require knowledge and technology that they simply don't possess.

So, the one thing that these countries are uniquely rich in is wildlife.

And so, relying on hunting is one of the only opportunities for them to generate growth.

This is being heavily hindered today by the ban on ivory.

This is a ban that other powerful countries have decided upon without considering for a moment the weak countries that are going to be most affected.

We think that the people of africa are more important than its elephants, and our obligation should rest with them first and foremost.

At the point at which we need to prioritize the lives of one over the other, we think that the choice should be easy.

But let's move on and say that you remained unconvinced and that you still believe that it's wrong to allow elephants to go extinct.

We have some bad news.

The ban on the ivory trade does very little to help on that regard.

Ivory is still a very desired commodity and the demand for it remains high.

Thus, like any other thing that's being banned, a black market is created.

All this ban does is make sure that instead of the countries themselves enjoying the benefits of ivory trade, all of the money goes into the pockets of illegal poachers.

With the current ban on the ivory trade, the countries have very little incentive to invest the efforts needed to stop these butchers because why should they care about the elephants' population if it's no longer a source of income?

Note: these poachers are even more likely to bring about the speedy extinction of the elephant population.

Why?

Because if we allow ivory trade, governments will want to make sure that the elephant population isn't eradicated entirely, because they want to continue making money off it.

So, they make sure they control the hunting.

Poachers aren't looking at the bigger picture.

Their incentive is to hunt down as many as possible right now before someone else gets to.

This is the well-known economic problem that's called the "" tragedy of the commons "".

This means that it's likely that lifting the ban will lead to the elephant population being extinct way quicker and even if not, at the very least, it won't do much to help them.

And so at the very least, we think that we have to look at where is the money being made, like where is the money being made from hunting put to better use, and that is if it reaches the countries and not the poachers.

So for all these reasons, proud to propose.

"
"sam_1961_sex-education_con_opening_yaar","1961","CON","sam","yaar","I stand in firm opposition to the motion sex education should be mandatory.

Although sex education is very helpful for the vast majority of students who learn it, forcing it down the throats of conservative or otherwise oppositional parents does little more than ostracize particular students and push parents to create worse learning environments for their children.

I have two overviews before two arguments.

My first overview is just addressing the whole of yaar's speech because we do not hear a single reason about why comprehensive sex education is more beneficial than abstinence only or other forms of sex education.

At the point where we don't get a meaningful benefit to sex education it is impossible to vote in favor of making it mandatory.

Essentially, forcing the government to use violence or other methods of enforcing a particular ideology upon schools.

Now my second overview is just addressing what the status quo actually is because in every single moderate place, in every single place that is liberal, we see comprehensive sex education.

The vast majority of states and municipalities have accepted comprehensive sex education as the best form for their children.

However, certain areas have accepted that abstinence only will be more effective.

There are nuances which can only be appreciated by those individuals from the district in which we are making the decision.

Pushing a unnuanced and universal ideology upon these people will likely have disastrous repercussions but the main purpose of this overview is simply saying in the places where sex education would go off without a hitch, it is already occurring.

In all others, the two arguments I'm about to make, will be actualized.

First, I want to address the role of schools.

For many students sex education makes them uncomfortable.

Whether it's a religious opposition, whether it's a personal opposition, when they are taught sex education they feel unsafe in the area that they're in and are less likely to learn effectively.

The result of this is that they are less likely to do well in school.

If you feel like your school is pushing a particular ideology, you are likely to rebel morally and ideologically against other teachings.

If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in the classroom it's more difficult to focus.

At the point where you cannot teach other essential essential topics such as math, english, literature, pushing the a certain subject at the detriment of all of the others does little more than create a political system for schools which does not serve the genuine purpose of schools which is educating their students.

Now my second argument is how parents will respond to sex education.

For many parents sex education is a deal breaker.

When a teacher tells their student this is the best way to have sex, this is the appropriate way to have sex, the result is that parents will rebel.

This can occur in a few ways.

First, in many areas they're less likely to volunteer or help their school in general.

For many schools that you don't have a lot of money and do not have a lot of support from their district, they need parent volunteers to be effective.

Pushing parents out of the classroom telling them that they are not welcome because their ideology does not fit that of the schools, will harm the whole of the the school and generally lead to worse education but we will also see wide scale exoduses away from these or from these schools.

You'll see many parents putting their child in home schooling or an alternative private school as a result of this sort of policy.

This is problematic on two fronts.

First, if wealthier parents, those who can afford to put their students in other schools decide to take them out of public schools, there'll be major political shift away from public schools to private schools which will decrease funding for public schools forcing education further.

Additionally, all those students who do not have parents who can afford to put them home schooling, will face far worse education leaving them destitute and essentially without a future.

This is the greatest harm that can be actualized upon these students and is it is not worth keeping some students sex education if others will be left out in the dry.

For this reason, sex education should not be mandatory.

"will_1961_sex-education_con_opening_james","1961","CON","will","james","I'm proud to oppose the motion that we should make sex education mandatory.

Our first independent point is that this will likely lead to worse sex education.

So we want to consider for a moment the landscape of the schools that have sex education.

Largely these are schools in fairly liberal areas that are more you know tolerant of these types of things like teenage sexuality or they're in states that even that are more liberal so even in like say a conservative area like upstate new york that might be reluctant to have sex education there's like a liberal state government that is going to mandate that sex education.

I think then the problem is that when you're talking about increasing the number of locations that have mandatory sex education you're necessarily talking about the types of places that reject it wholesale in the status quo.

So really conservative rural areas like say texas maybe or in alabama like a lot of the deep south really is what you're looking at in this kind of cross section.

The problem then with mandating sex education without putting specific requirements on what constitutes sex education is two fold.

First you have a system of that is likely to result in either a bad practices being taught so like for example they just force some hapless gym teacher in there that you know it's such as like this guy that doesn't understand how the pill works and so they give actively bad advice that actually increases problematic sex you know like activities and doesn't actually educate people properly.

Or secondly they have larger structures that are you know structurally harmful like abstinence only sex education which statistically increases teen pregnancy and STD rates.

So at the point where you have these this counter factual this is the type of system that's going to be set up in these regions that don't already have sex education I think the problem the question then becomes is this bad sex education worse than no sex education.

I think the answer is yes for two reasons.

First in the status quo even in a hyper conservative area there are children that are still going to get access to good sex education without it being present in the schools because they grow up in families that are more tolerant of these issues and as such they'll learn about these things in the household.

But having sex education that pushes bad badly informed norms directly counters what they're learning in the household then and as such the only children that are likely to get proper education on these issues are now having their education distorted.

But secondly we think there's an issue because a lot of the practices themselves are necessarily harmful that abstinence only sex education for example creates disillusionment on the student body.

This is by dare for example the like notorious over the top like drug awareness program actually increase drug usage rates because it creates disillusionment with authority structures in the school.

Even if government tries to tell you then that like the state mandating the system can just create like a good system the problem is that in the status quo the states that don't have mandatory sex education are the same states that are likely to actually mandate these problematic forms of sex education.

Texas for example if forced to mandate sex ed for all of its high schools would probably say that it has to be abstinence only this then again increases the proliferation of harmful norms.

Our second in a point to pending point briefly is parental rights.

We think that parents are the best proxy for young children on the basis of that the children themselves aren't capable of performing informed consent when they're at such a young age and as such the parent has the best interests of the child in mind because the child can't make these decisions for themselves.

At that point then if there are parents that don't want their kids to receive sex education we believe that they and not the state have the better information on what is and isn't right for their child.

Proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_1961_sex-education_pro_opening","1961","PRO","yaar","","Sex education should be mandatory.

By this we mean to give comprehensive lessons around the age of fifteen, you know, beginning of high school, that would be passed on by experts, and in which the children will learn the following things: what number one, about the dangers of having unsafe sex, STD's, unwanted pregnancies, and so on.

Number two, correct usage of contraceptions, and number three how to be respectful towards your partner, when and if having sex.

We fully understand, that by doing so, the school is making a stand on a sensitive subject, that some parents might not be happy with.

We nonetheless strongly believe that this is a stand that must be taken.

Two arguments, number one, why do we think that sex ed is so crucial, and cannot be simply left for the parents?

And number two, why are we willing to upset or displease conservative or religious parents, in order to do so?

So, to the first arguments.

First of all, we think that it can be widely agreed upon, that it is essential that children in these ages, in which they start exploring their sexuality, will somehow learn about the three things that I've mentioned in the opening of my speech.

Now, we admits, fully, that to many children, perhaps most children, sex education classes aren't really necessary.

They wouldn't really teach you a lot of new stuff, and they usually are just a funny experience, or an awkward experience, and that is because many parents do sit down and talk with their children, and explain them, in an orderly fashion, you know, the birds and the bees talk.

Or, they have a big brother or a bigger sister, that that can use that they can be used as an example.

But, there are also children, that don't get to learn this in an orderly fashion, whether because their parents don't really know how to breach this subject, and prefer to avoid it altogether, or because they barely see their parents, that have to work like every day, and and get home back very late, or for any other reason really.

And, what these children will probably be exposed to are things like pornography.

And we think that pornography is a horrible example to learn from, both in terms of safety, and in terms of being respectful.

Sex ed classes are free.

These particular children, exactly the balancing factor that's so needed.

We have to make sure these children have at least one positive image of how sexuality should look like.

So, over to the next argument, why are we willing to displease certain parents?

First of all, because the like the children of these parents, despite what they might be thinking, are just as much children as other children, and then there's a huge probability that they will go out and explore their sexuality, one way or another during these years.

To think otherwise is to be incredibly naive, even blinded, to human nature, and we owe it to the children, not to the parents.

Those children might feel embarrassed, by having their parents upset from this.

It might put them in a tight spot, but it would be a hundred times better than having them, you know, have accidental like having them accidentally conceive and have to go through an abortion.

Additionally, the fact that there is a certain group that opposes some content, that's being delivered in the classroom, cannot be a good enough justification to avoid that this content.

Otherwise, we would have been left with barely nothing.

Should we avoid teaching evolution, just because creationists oppose it?

In like in every history class, we are teaching contents that are political, by definition, because the mere decision what to discuss, and what not to discuss, is political.

And so, you can never ever please all of the factions and groups in society.

So, to sum it all up, we showed you that sex ed is critical, for these children, and that there is no good cause to avoid discussing it.

Support the motion.

"
"james_1961_sex-education_pro_opening","1961","PRO","james","","Sex education should be mandatory.

So in this debate, I think that we're talking about sex education, things like condom use, teaching children about pregnancy, how to avoid STD's, things like that.

And we're talking about this in state run schools.

So, when we say mandatory, we think that, you know, this would be a class, probably offered in health, or gym class, at a school.

So two big arguments for you, but they're both about individual health.

So before we get into those two arguments, I just want to say that, we think that the state has a compelling interest in better individual health.

Young people, who are healthy, are going to be better workers in the future, so the hope to grow the economy, if it's a developing country, they're going to help your country to develop.

And on top of that, since states ultimately pay for health care, through things like national health in britain, we think that, ultimately the state has a compelling interest to limit its expenses, with regard to sexual health.

Two big arguments then, the first is about how this limits teen pregnancies.

We think that, most teen pregnancies are ultimately caused by ignorance.

Young people who don't understand how teen pregnancy actually works, because they haven't been educated by their parents, who might be conservative or religious, or even parents who don't fully understand sexual health on their own, because they weren't educated in the past.

So, we think that many young women, in particular, are really grossly harmed, because they have unprotected sex, they don't understand the risks of getting pregnant, and then suddenly they have a child, and their community wants them to drop out of school, and raise that child, so ultimately, their education gets put on hold, they've a hard time getting a good job, and their future earnings are greatly decreased, their ability to you know go on to improve their own standard of living of their family standard of living is really decreased.

We see that, this has huge impacts on these people, especially teenage girls, as a result of teenage pregnancy.

But, it's relatively easy to educate people about how to avoid pregnancy.

You know, everything that you learned in school, especially condom use I think, is going to be important here.

Many young people, even in very developed countries like the US, their parents don't teach them anything about condom use, they might know that condoms exist, but perhaps they don't understand how to safely apply them, or when to use them.

So ultimately, teen pregnancies, that are easily prevented through condom use, are not going to be prevented, and that's to say nothing about forms of birth control, that young woman might not even know exist.

A lot of them probably know about the pill in developed countries, but in many developing countries, they might just be completely ignorant of the pill's existence.

And in the US, they may have a lot of stereotypes, or misinformation from the media about it, that would limit their ability to get on something, that could really help them to take control of their own life, not only with regards to pregnancy, but also with regard to regulating menstruation.

Ultimately we think that, you really empower young women as a result of sexual education.

Our second argument then is about how this limits STD's.

So, everybody today is very concerned about the spread of HIV and aids, and if we look at the regions where HIV has spread the most rapidly, it's in areas with very limited sexual education.

If you look at it in the US, it's been mostly in the gay community that, people been really affected by this awful disease.

The reason why that's probably true, is that schools, even up, unfortunately, until the present, don't teach young people about homosexual sexual education.

They only focus on heterosexual sexual education, which means that young people aren't informed about how to avoid getting an STD, they don't know that they need to use condoms, and things like that, with homosexual intercourse.

So ultimately, we think that, sex ed should be mandatory to limit the spread of STD's, not only, you know obviously, nobody wants an STD, but especially things like HIV, they can actually be life threatening in the future, and obviously they'd run up a huge cost for the government, in the forms of treatment.

So, because we better stop teen pregnancies, and empower young women, and because we limit the spread of HIV, sex education should be mandatory, thank you.

"
"will_1963_bullfighting_con_opening_james","1963","CON","will","james","I am proud to oppose the motion that we should ban bullfighting.

Our first independent point regards human enjoyment.

So, the fact that this is something that's, you know, so heavily prevalent in spanish culture and so many people go to it probably signals that a lot of people, you know, get a kick out of this, that they go to bullfighting events, and this is something they do, you know, with their family.

This is just like, whatever, casual sunday enjoyment.

That then, you know, means that there is obviously like a tangible benefit to having this practice in place, that, you know, people see this and much in the same way they might see a movie or go to a show, this is something that they enjoy watching.

Given that then, there is certainly a human element of enjoyment to this and at the point where you're weighing that against the animal's rights, I think it's important to establish that animals probably don't have rights.

Specifically gov sets up like this pain-pleasure metric, but I think the problem is that rights don't come from pain and pleasure, rather they come from sort of a a position of higher order intelligence and specifically the capacity to become, you know, self-aware and understand one's own preferences in a much more detailed fashion.

At that point then, because humans do operate at higher order thinking levels, it makes sense to prioritize the wishes of humans, even if the the level of like suffering versus pleasure is, you know, disjunct.

Our second independent point regards culture.

So I think much like the the raw enjoyment stemmed from this, this is like another benefit to humans that, particularly within spain, this is something that is deeply and historically ingrained into spanish culture, and something that people fundamentally regard as a part of their identity.

I think this is particularly what makes it a distinct benefit is that this is something that people specifically identify with and see as fundamentally important to their lives.

I think at the point where someone's identity is tied up in a practice, it takes on a much more significant position, because not only do they just get like enjoyment out of seeing this, but if it were to be banned people would be upset at like an existential level.

I think identity is something that is fundamentally important to human beings insofar as it shapes our perception of who we are as individuals, and insofar as it is that sort of like higher order preference, that it is something that people see as extremely important, we should afford extreme weight to it.

I think even if like you or I don't particularly sympathize with bullfighting on that level, understandings of significance and importance and relative benefits are often subjective and as such, if the individual people on the ground say this is something that's really, really massively important to them, we should respect those wishes and respect those preferences.

Our third and final independent point is that making bullfighting illegal, because it is so heavily demanded, will simply result in underground bullfighting.

An analogous example in much of central america, and even in spain itself, is cockfighting, where instead of having the sort of like open available and regulated cockfights, bullfighting would simply become something like what cockfighting is today, where it is wildly unregulated and as such, the abuses internalized by animals are much more significant and much more extreme.

Given that then, we think there is significant harm intrinsic to making this sort of practice illegal and making it harder to conduct this in an open in an open and public fashion where, you know, government officials can step in and say these practices are humane, these practices are not humane.

Proud to oppose.

"
"tim_1963_bullfighting_con_opening_will","1963","CON","tim","will","Bullfighting should not be banned.

In this round we're going to make to main arguments: the first is that we would say that animals do not have rights, and they certainly don't have rights to the extent that protects them from being killed, and the second is that people should be allowed to take risks, in that risk aversion and trying to maximize the length of one's life is not the only metric of a good life lived.

Okay so on animals and animal rights: we would say that rights rather than being some ethereal thing that is defined by the universe around us are rather just a social construct made by humanity.

That when we came together in societies there were certain ideas and certain protections that people viewed as necessary in order for them to have a reasonably good livelihood.

And those are what we choose to deem as rights.

Animals are simply not a part of this construct.

They're not something that we take into account when we choose what are the preferences that people would hold.

For example, we don't think of what the preferences of a pig are and try to give that pig a certain degree of control over how we form the system of rights.

We form it with the idea of what humans need in mind, and we also have certain tenants that make those rights capable of being upheld that animals cannot respect, and therefore extending rights to those animals doesn't make sense.

The first is that animals cannot internalize the value of rights.

Part of rights being part of the value of rights themselves is not the idea that it allows you to have this protection, to have these freedoms, but to know that you have those freedoms and to make choices for yourself and to make decisions for your life and your future with those protections in mind.

For example I know that I have the right to reasonable trial or a trial by a jury of my peers and a right to be protected in court, all these types of things.

These rights allow me to make decisions with the idea that I won't be unjustly prosecuted for taking some sort of act that the government may not entirely approve of, but something that isn't illegal.

And this allows me to make choices in the future based on that understanding.

Animals don't have this ability and therefore much of the value of rights go away.

Secondly and most importantly animals cannot reciprocate those rights.

The only way that rights have power within a society is when all of us choose to reciprocate those obligations and those rights unto those around us.

The reason that the right to life has become so valuable is because most of the vast majority of people choose to acknowledge that that right is important and respect that claim to rights from other people.

I choose not to kill others in part because I do not want to set up a norm system where people could kill me.

Look, at the end of the day bullfighting kills a bull in just a more entertaining way than the slaughter house, but it the end result is the exact same.

And if you think that the slaughter house is okay, if you think that animals can be slaughtered to feed people, and if you think that the system of rights that we have requires a reciprocation to be upheld, clearly the extent of animal rights that banning bullfighting would require do not exist and should not exist.

Okay, so now let's talk about the safety of people.

Firstly, it's simply not that dangerous to be a bull fighter.

It's very rare for a bullfighter to die or be seriously injured while doing this task.

And if they do harm themselves this is a risk they can take on without third party harms.

So my choice to making risky decision on my behalf to be a bullfighter doesn't directly harm anyone else in my general vicinity.

It's not setting up a risk onto other people that couldn't consent and that risk.

Given that, I am able to fully consent and fully, with knowledge that I could be harmed, choose to be a bull fighter.

We think that it is fair to seek out thrill, to seek out excitement, to seek out a cultural practice rather than to be simply choosing to be maximally risk averse, which is what the protectionism of this idea, the protectionism of this ban would demand.

It is not the case that animals hold the rights that require this to be banned, is not the case that humans need to have this decision made for them and that life must be maximized in all terms.

For these reasons, bullfighting should not be banned.

"
"james_1963_bullfighting_pro_opening","1963","PRO","james","","Bull fighting should be banned.

So, bullfighting is a traditional, I don't know if you call it sport or a game, where a matador lures a bull, and tries to kill it.

It was, I believe, invented in medieval spain, and was popular in southern france, some other parts of europe, spread to latin america from spain, but predominantly is practice there.

And we're saying that, it should be completely illegal there shouldn't be any phase out period, we would prefer that this happen tomorrow.

So with that in mind, we have two main arguments for why it ought be banned.

The first is that, bullfighting is fundamentally cruel.

Recognize that, this is a game made of torturing an animal.

We see that, even countries like spain have banned cock fighting, and other sports which are cruel to animals, and we don't see why bullfighting should be unique.

It seems clear that, bulls deserve moral consideration.

Recognize that, while cattle are not the most intelligent creatures, that certainly they prefer pleasure to pain, certainly, given the opportunity, they will avoid dying, they'll take steps to preserve their own lives, they may not be as intelligent as human beings, but we can see that, clearly, their preference is being violated when they're killed, verses when they're not.

We think that, moreover not only are they being killed, but they're tormented along the way.

They're stabbed with swords, this is part of the game,.

We see that, ultimately, this is much worse than other ways that animals are mistreated in our society, like the meat industry, because the torture is part of the pleasure that people experience, when they see a bullfight.

It seems that, at the point where you're violating the or the eh the wishes of a moral actor, that it's clear that this is unethical, and we think that, broadly speaking, state should intervene to prevent unethical behavior.

We see that other forms of animal cruelty had been banned, not because they harm the state in any way, but because they're seen as unethical.

We see that it's or that it's banned for people to litter, say, which is also an ethical.

So it's clear that, governments intervene in this way regularly throughout europe.

We think that, bullfighting should not be special case, just because it has some cultural legacy.

Things like cock fighting also have a cultural legacy, but they've been banned because they're fundamentally cruel.

Our second argument is that, bullfighting harm spain's international image.

When you remind people that spain is a country where the national sport is tormenting animals, I don't think anyone has a positive reaction to the country.

We think that, particularly because spain's economy is so dependent on tourism, that this is something that they ought to be aware of.

But moreover, we think that, on a european scale, this harm spain's image.

Other european countries take a much stricter line against animal cruelty.

We think that it's very likely that, in the future, the european union is going to intervene, if spain continues to refuse to ban it in itself.

What does that do to spain's international image, if the european union has to intervene to ban animal cruelty?

Well, we think first of all that, it makes it look like the country's government is incompetent, which is already a risk given spain's poor governance leading up to and during the financial crisis.

But two, we think it makes it more likely that the international community will be unsympathetic to spain in other spheres.

So we think that, for instance, if catalonia, a region of spain which wants to secede, takes this to the next level, and request european or international intervention to support their secession, that it's much more likely that people will be sympathetic, especially given that catalonia has actually banned bullfighting, although it's a traditional sport there as well.

In general, no matter what spain wants to do in its involvement with the international community, whether that be IMF loans, or hosting the olympics, we think tat it will always be hindered by the fact that they have this stain on their national character, in the form of bullfighting.

So, because of the moral worth of the bull, and also because of a harm to spain's image, bullfighting should be banned, thank you.

"
"will_1963_bullfighting_pro_opening","1963","PRO","will","","We're proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban bullfighting.

We'll model this as being enforced pretty comparably to other forms of animal fighting like dog fighting or cock fighting.

So that is to say that there are prison sentences or at least hefty fines with both people who organize these types of events as well as the individual trainers who own the animals that are then subjected to this type of violence.

Two independent points.

Our first being just sort of broadly animal rights and how bullfighting violates them.

First establishing why animal rights exist and matter.

Rights, generally speaking, are something that we think of as just something that's inalienable, something that's really fundamental to our nature and can't be infringed upon like say, our right to life something that we hold in very high regard and are generally going to prioritize above you know more simple like utilitarian impacts.

Oftentimes these are construed as being you know unique to humans but we think that the reason why they ought be extended to animals is that you know fundamentally there just isn't a consistent principle that justifies why these are unique to humans.

There's really two lenses through which this is generally seen.

The one justifying humans only is sort of like an intelligence based standard.

That is that because humans are very self aware and they're sentient and they're more intelligent than animals, they uniquely get rights.

I think the problem is that there's not a well established bright line on this that the determines how intelligent you have to be for rights.

Certainly one problem with this is that we generally think of humans with like intellectual disabilities or just generally unintelligent people still having rights.

So I don't think it's a very principally consistent standard then to apply to.

I think the more consistent standard is the other one which is just if something experiences pain and pleasure it deserves rights because suffering is bad.

I don't think there's any benefit to animal suffering, obviously not in a vacuum, and as such it's something that we should consider as mattering.

That when animals experience pain and we can demonstrably see that they are experiencing pain, then we should you know not cause that pain.

This is reflected in our norms actually.

Things like animal abuse are illegal but like inconsistently we believe that killing them is fine.

I think particularly then, killing them through ways that are very inhumane and cause lots of lots of harm and pain and suffering onto the animal that are even torturous, should be considered especially reprehensible.

Bullfighting particularly represents this.

Bullfighting involves a long, slow, and violent process by which the animal is killed.

It's also subjected to like large amounts of violence just in the process of the bullfight and in the lead up to the bullfight.

They're often held in inhumane conditions.

As such, we think the bullfighting represents a lot of harm that is inflicted upon animals simply for human enjoyment and that this is principally unjust and should be banned, but secondly, we think that a ban is justified even from a purely human-centric perspective because it's a process that hurts humans too.

Bullfighting is exceptionally dangerous.

Bulls are strong, they are fast, and they are extremely extremely violent creatures.

At that point then, humans are subjecting themselves to a large amount of risk simply for the purpose of entertainment.

In other forms of entertainment we've instituted bans on the basis of large amounts of risk and I don't think that we should you know stop the buck simply because it's a cultural thing.

Generally it's part of our culture is a weak argument simply on the basis that we have banned other things intrinsic to our culture you know such as like slavery or other types of just inherently bad things on the basis that they cause suffering.

Given that, I don't think that we should perpetuate something that puts humans at a significant amount of risk of suffering.

Prop to propose.

"
"will_2110_age-of-consent_con_opening_james","2110","CON","will","james","I am proud to oppose the motion that we should lower the age of consent.

Three independent points: first is parental rights.

So I want to establish something quite clearly: that the way the status quo looks is that if someone who is under age has sex with someone who is above the age of consent by a considerable amount, I'll get to the romeo and juliet laws and a little bit but, like for the meantime let's recognize that it's a considerable gap in the status quo, what happens is the parents make an active decision on whether or not they're going to press charges against that individual.

We think this is important because it ensures that parents have the right to some degree of autonomy over their child sexual activity.

The reason that we often make decisions about whether or not kids can make specific choices for themselves is because they don't have the necessary information about the world in order to have informed consent.

That is to say that they understand the implications of what they're doing and as such can agree to those implications.

We proxy those decision making powers off to the parents in situations like say, where they're going to go to school or whether they go to school, things like that.

In order to ensure that, essentially, someone who knows their best interest but also understands the world can help them with the decision making process.

We think that lowering the age of consent then infringes upon those parental rights because it gets rid of the legal mechanism that allows parents to have some say in their child's sexual activity.

Often at such a young age, children don't understand the long term consequences of things like unprotected sex, sex in a relationship with a power imbalance due to the age gap, and other associated harms.

As such we think it's important to protect that parental right to consent or parental right.

Our second independent point is power imbalances in relationships.

So government talks pretty extensively about romeo and juliet laws.

I want this to be clear, romeo and juliet laws exist in the status quo.

So if a seventeen year old has or a sixteen year old, rather, has sex with like an eighteen year old or a nineteen year old, that's already legal in most states.

I think the difference that's being established on side government is just how low you push the bar.

You're not getting rid of the gray zone on our side of the house.

So then I think what's important to recognize is that power imbalances are that exist in relationships can basically jump drastically over a small age range.

So the amount of you know sexual maturity that an individual has and their knowledge of you know how relationships work and what consent is is drastically different between say ages sixteen and eighteen.

We think that it's fundamentally problematic then to push the age of consent as low as government is insisting because we think if you push it down to like sixteen that creates like legal justification for a sixteen year old to say have sex with like a forty year old.

That level of power imbalance is unacceptable and we think that it's important to ensure that once this person is free to have sex with someone of any age, they are actually ready to make those decisions and they are capable of you know essentially standing up for themselves in situations where their age imbalance might materialize into a power imbalance.

Our third independent point is the signal that this policy sends.

So we think that generally, the state should look out for the interests of people.

We think that a lot of the rhetoric surrounding age of consent laws is essentially protecting children.

That is to signal that people of this age, our children, are incapable often of informed consent of their own volition and as such need protection from the state.

We think that lowering this age of consent sends the signal that people between sixteen and eighteen don't need those protections, that they are capable of fending for themselves.

We think that oftentimes this isn't true.

So even beyond just the pragmatic impacts of what this policy entails, we think there's a problematic signal sent from the state that then creates a societal discursive shift that is problematic for the individuals that are now going to be losing their legal protections.

Proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_2110_age-of-consent_con_opening_will","2110","CON","rachel","will","Will cannot have it both ways.

He has to choose are these laws rarely enforced and thus do not matter or do we live in a dictatorship in which every sixteen year old who has sex is dragged into court.

We think that it is somewhere in between.

We don't think that anyone is getting deprived of their sexual liberation.

Will rightfully points out that the majority of the time these laws aren't enforced.

It's really rare that the eighteen year old is sued by the sixteen year old because they're both in the same high school class.

Rather we think that we need these laws in place for those edge cases for when people need to press charges or when someone is being truly abused.

These systems are checks in a world where we hope we never have to use them.

More than this, we don't think that we have to do this in the dumb way.

Op is open to adjustments in laws, not persecuting people who are within two years of each other or other similar kinds of adjustments.

The only thing that we're truly defending is a strict age of consent at eighteen year olds eighteen years old.

Two main areas of clash.

The first on the promotion of sexualization of youth by these kinds of laws.

When you remove illegality you create a market.

Already one of the largest porn searches are teen and amateur.

Now you can have actual teens on that screen.

Recognize the only thing stopping industries such as porn or other like sexually objectifying TV shows from using very young children is that it's illegal to do so.

We think at the point that you remove that boundary you're going to have these people increasingly sexualized and younger and younger people because this is already the trend that we're moving toward.

Sure I gave you one more extreme example but we also think that there's going to be a general increase in more suggestive media with youth as you see less and less stigmatization of young sex.

This means more and more immersion in sex before you are old enough to even conceptualize it, what it might mean.

Government is right.

You can't remove all the influences but you can definitely not add to that fire by removing the age of consent.

Society has gone far enough with sexualizing young women.

We tell you no more.

Our second area of clash has to do with the protection of minors because even if they might understand the physical mechanism of sex, we don't think they usually understand the intimate, emotional details.

Will is right, there is a power disbalance between ages but that isn't created by the age of consent rather that existed before hand and the age of consent is created to protect against it.

Older men and women will always be more experienced and be able to leverage emotional power against the younger people they are sleeping with.

Combine this oftentimes with financial power and you end up in the kind of power disbalance relationships that we're talking about.

It's just true that there is something wrong with the twenty eight year old who's dating sixteen year old and that sixteen year old probably needs to be protected from them.

We think that you need to have that legal catch hole for when there is a problem and when someone does want to press charges because the alternative is a world in which regardless of how much abuse you're going through, you cannot prove it because this is just part of being in a relationship.

We need to offer special protections, specifically to minors, because they are much more likely to be exploited.

Not only do they often not know what a healthy relationship looks like, but they are often taught by the media that the way in which they can gain love or acceptance is by offering themselves up sexually.

And we think that at some point these people need to be protected from themselves and from the media they consume their entire lives.

As such the age of consent is fine.

The only thing that needs changing is people's mindsets and how we view it.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"will_2110_age-of-consent_pro_opening","2110","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should lower the age of consent.

With regards to the model I think generally speaking, across countries there are variations in what the exact age of consent is.

For the sake of this debate, I will assume that the age of consent is generally around eighteen but there is obviously some degree of fluctuation.

That said, that fluctuation probably doesn't matter terribly much, because the fluctuation is largely a product of social conventions that will determine how a child is treated in their early age.

And generally speaking, those distinct ages should reflect the way the society treats children such that they will generally be ready by that age.

That said, I think three two independent points that demonstrate why there are structural reasons that ages of consent are set too high.

So the first independent point is that the structural reasons prevent consensual relationships.

So generally speaking, the capacity to engage in a consensual relationship exists at a fairly early age.

This is for a couple reasons, I think one is that modern media has evolved in such a way that has allowed children to or not children but has allowed like younger individuals to understand the complexities of sexual interaction at a comparatively earlier age than it was previously the case.

And I think then the structural problem becomes that age of consent laws have not adapted to this changing culture.

That despite the fact that people are generally under generally have an understanding of what sexual interaction constitutes and what the risks are at a much earlier age than they used to.

We still have not changed those age laws and as a result they are higher than they ought be.

But secondly I think it's important to recognize the harms that are that originate from when these laws are when these aged limits are too high.

So sexual expression is something that is key to an individual's identity.

I think it is almost intuitively true that it's something people care a lot about but it's also something that shapes a lot of our decision making.

That people care deeply enough about this that they are willing to make really significant sacrifices for sexual interaction.

And I think that's a significant point, because generally whether or not someone is valuing an individual end as something that they care very deeply about, that's pretty much our best proxy for whether or not it's key to their identity.

That based on their capacity to engage in sexual relationships, they shape perceptions of their self worth, they shape their priorities of what they're going to do with their life.

This is something that's really significant to an individual and I think depriving them of the capacity to capitalize upon that aspect of their identity is something that generates significant harm.

But secondly I just want to point out that these laws are often ineffective at doing what they are designed to do.

I think the reason that we have age of consent laws in the first place is that we recognize that at a very young age people do not understand the ramifications of of sex.

But I think I've demonstrated why generally speaking we have ages that are too high in terms of the bright line of when we should allow them to consent into this.

I think the other reason though why these laws exist is that there are power asymmetries intrinsic between relationships between extremely young individuals and comparatively older individuals.

I think the problem though is that having an age of consent doesn't do a particularly good job of preventing these relationships that have distinct power dynamics.

And the reason for this is something that's actually quite similar to why pedophilia existed within the catholic church.

That when there is that power dynamic, a cover up, getting the victim to not really speak up, is quite easy.

So I think that having that age of consent doesn't actually do very much to ensure that the person will be punished and doesn't do very much to disincentive those problematic relationships.

As a result, the laws don't do what they're meant to do.

Proud to propose.

"
"james_2110_age-of-consent_pro_opening","2110","PRO","james","","We should lower the age of consent.

So by this we mean that in jurisdictions where it's not already the case we think that the age of consent should be sixteen years old for men and women and that there should be romeo and juliet laws.

So these are laws which basically say that if two people are under the age of consent, then it's legal for them to have sex with one another even if it wouldn't be legal for them to have sex with an adult.

And basically these laws are designed to prevent, you know, teenagers who are in a relationship from accidentally ending up on the sex offender registry for something that was completely consensual and probably shouldn't be illegal.

So with that in mind we're going to present two arguments for why we think these would be good policies.

The first is basically that kids will be kids.

We think that ultimately no one is being harmed if two people who are not adults yet choose to engage in consensual sexual activity.

We think that in many jurisdictions right now the punishments are extremely harsh.

In many american states people can end up on a sex offenders list, where for the rest of their life it's going to be difficult for them to get employed.

They won't be able to join the military, they won't be able to access some sorts of education, they're gonna have to tell their neighbors that they're a sex offender until the day that they die.

And this is obviously a system that was designed to go after perverts and people who are doing really awful things not sixteen year olds who hooked up after prom one night.

So we think that the law isn't actually serving the purpose it was intended to create.

We think that it's really important that we don't let the letter of the law get in the way of protecting and helping people.

So obviously we want to protect minors from being taken advantage of by adults, but we also want to recognize that people who are sixteen are probably able to consent to being in a relationship and having sexual intercourse with one another and doing that in a responsible way, particularly if we offer things like sex education in schools.

So we think that at that point the best way that the law can help these people is to make it so that there is these romeo and juliet laws so that people can engage in sex with their peers while still protecting them if they're taken advantage of by someone older.

And also by recognizing that sixteen year olds are probably able to make meaningful consent.

Which leads nicely into my second point, which is about legal consistency.

So in many american states people are able to get married at age sixteen.

You can join the military with your parents consent at age sixteen.

You can drive a car at age sixteen.

We think that all of these are probably bigger decisions than choosing to have sex.

So at that point we think that the law should be consistent.

Basically, if people are being given a high amount of authority to make decisions about their own lives, we think that those decisions should be free for them to make across the board.

I don't see why someone who is emotionally and physically mature enough to drive a car or serve in the nation's military shouldn't also be allowed to engage in a consensual sexual relationship.

It just seems that if the government is saying that that person's judgment is good enough for one, it should clearly be good enough for the other.

We think that the possibility for a third party harms or great personal risk from people choosing to have consensual sex is much lower, honestly, than driving much less getting married or serving in the military.

So we think that at that point that the government should be consistent and lower the age of consent to sixteen across the board.

And the other team might say well, it's only in america that people can do these things when they're so young.

But we still think that it's clear that sixteen year olds in different countries around the world probably have similar levels of emotional maturity.

What might be the case is that there's not enough sexual education in some parts of the world for young people to fully understand things like STDs or the risk of pregnancy and how to use contraception.

But we think that in that case it would be better to facilitate access to that information and access to contraception rather than just to ban any sort of sexual activity.

Because we don't think that's ever going to be effective.

There's no way to stop young people from having sex and the law should take that into account.

And even if it might be preferable for some people's, you know, moral or religious beliefs that young people didn't have sex at the point where they will the law should be pragmatic and acknowledge that and try to protect young people from unforeseen legal consequences like ending up on a sex offender registry and to provide information and contraceptives and things like that so that they can be safe.

So for these reasons we would lower the age of consent.

"
"tim_2185_unconventional-oil_con_opening_daniel","2185","CON","tim","daniel","We should not further exploit unconventional oil.

We think that in the status quo there are many avenues of clean energy that are being developed and other opportunities that we think unconventional oil simply crowds out and that we think is unnecessary.

So we're going to talk about two main things.

We're going to talk about why unconventional oil is simply bad for the environment, and why that matters more than anything else, and then we're going to talk about alternative methods of getting energy and why those are preferable.

Okay so recognize that alternate methods of oil are the least clean ways of extracting oil.

Going to things like sands and using fracking are both incredibly difficult in the status quo, which means the method of the of extraction both requires the use of energy in order to extract at a higher rate than other types of energy extraction, but also have the most impact on local ecology.

You need to do drilling, you need to do types of things that ruin the habitats of animals that exist in these areas, oftentimes in areas that have already been decimated by the impacts of climate change.

So what are the two impacts of these bad things?

First it destroys local ecosystems.

When you destroy local ecosystems we think that there are massive long term ramifications in the area.

If you desolate an ecosystem and if you desolate a habitat it means that many species can be put at risk, it means that the entire environment of the area could change, which could have ramifications on on everything from agriculture in the area, to weather in the area, to basically people's standard of living in these areas.

We don't think that this is worth it, to extract more dirty energy.

The other thing that can happen, which often happens, especially with methods like fracking, is polluting the water supply.

When you pollute a water supply, especially in some areas that are simply already at risk of losing water at losing access to clean water, especially with global warming decreasing the level of access to clean water across the globe, we think that what's likely to happen is that the people in these areas are going to suffer because of because of unconventional oil.

It means their access to clean water goes down, and this is a basic necessity that these people need in order for their survival.

And we don't think that it's necessary to adopt these types of these types of energy.

We simply think that in the status quo we are on the path that is unsustainable.

That global warming is an inevitability that we need to try and stop right now before you reach a further tipping point.

We think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems, you're only adding to the problem in the status quo.

You're only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is is unacceptable, and is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people and even for people in the status quo.

We think that this isn't worth it, especially given the alternatives that exist.

So recognize that alternative clean methods of energy are becoming incredibly and increasingly cheap and viable.

Things like solar wind and hydro technology are becoming more and more efficient every year, and as they become more efficient these methods also become cheaper, which is why we've seen the rise in solar technology not just in the united states but also in more developing nations like china, because it's becoming even more efficient and even more worthwhile to use.

Given that these other methods of technology exist and that even if they may be expensive in the status quo, there are also avenues for more innovation.

The innovation surrounding green technology, surrounding things like wind and solar energy, are simply more innovative than using oil.

Using the same energy methods that we've been using for the past hundred years.

For the past two hundred years.

We think that when you even if it means you need to subsidize these other type of energies, it means you're likely to get more innovation and you're guaranteed not to increase pollution.

Not only are these energies very useful for emissions rates that they lower CO_2 emissions, but they're also really environmentally friendly for local habitats.

You don't need to destroy an entire ecosystem in order to collect sunlight or wind from a certain area.

Given that these clean technologies are increasingly becoming efficient, we simply do not think it is necessary, nor do we think it is worthwhile, to exploit further unconventional oil.

We think that we would rather use methods that aren't going to do in the future of our planet, that aren't going to doom future societies, and for these reasons we should not further exploit unconventional oil.

"
"james_2185_unconventional-oil_con_opening_tim","2185","CON","james","tim","We should not further exploit unconventional oil.

So we're going to explain to you why oil resources like tar sand should not be further exploited for their energy.

Our first point is about how this prolongs oil dependence and ultimately makes our environmental situation all the more dire.

When we first started hearing a lot about peak oil in the early two thousands from people like al gore and the anti-global warming movement, one of the ideas that was proposed was that society would naturally move towards renewable resources as oil prices grew.

And we saw that over the course of the two thousands, oil prices continued to increase until many people in the US were clamoring for some alternative because they could no longer afford oil.

And the same became true in other countries around the world, although oil prices have generally been higher in europe than in the US.

But what's happened in the last few years as a result of the discovery and exploitation of tar sands and other alternative sources of oil is that the political and social pressure in favor of renewable energy has been dampened.

What this means is any momentum that was built up in the two thousands in favor of things like alternative ways to power cars has died back due to the influx and glut, basically, of american oil.

In particular, the united states for thirty years was the world's largest importer of oil and because of that, there was a strong movement within the US to build alternative energy so that this country would be energy independent.

And so we saw the US as a leader for alternative energy.

But now the united state has actually become one of the world's largest oil exporters due to opening up alternative oil in north dakota and alaska.

So what we see is that the united states has now become a global enemy, basically, of alternative energy.

We're not investing money into this and we're making it less profitable for foreign companies, be they in japan or germany, to ultimately do this, because they don't have access to that american market as long as oil remains very cheap.

So in the long term, this is going to harm our ability to pivot to green energy and prolong the effects of massive oil use.

Therefore, we should not exploit these tar sands and other resources.

Our second argument is that these alternative sources of oil are more harmful than the easy oil of texas or saudi arabia.

In order to access tar sands and many of the other sources of oil that we're talking about in this debate, you basically have to completely destroy the environment where they're found.

All of the sediment is removed and processed in order to extract the oil.

Compare the way that we drill for oil in the gulf of mexico, where a small pipe is driven through the ground but ultimately, very little damage is done.

Now the other side's going to talk about oil spills I'm sure.

But ultimately the harms of the BP oil spill a few years ago are much less to the gulf of mexico than removing all the sediment from large parts of north dakota is to those ecosystems.

So we tell you that this oil not only prolongs our dependence on fossil fuels, but also that its extraction is vastly more harmful than traditional forms of extraction that we see in places like kuwait.

And our third and final point is just a response to tim's analysis about opec.

We tell you that ultimately, the huge drop in oil prices globally has done more to harm ordinary people living in petroleum states than it's done to their governments.

So even if you don't like venezuela or russia's governments, the people who really suffer here are the people not the government.

And I know that russia's not part of opec, but they're probably the best example of this.

The russian ruble has completely collapsed due to the devaluation of oil and as a result, the russian people have been put under a great deal of pressure as they've lost their savings, while vladimir putin remains in power and popular and hasn't been affected at all.

So we don't think that the united states becoming an oil exporter by using this energy has actually been a good thing globally speaking.

It's only hurt innocent people in oil-producing countries.

So for all these reasons, we should not further exploit unconventional oil.

Thank you.

"
"tim_2185_unconventional-oil_pro_opening","2185","PRO","tim","","We should further exploit unconventional oil.

So in this debate we want to talk primarily about the benefits of energy independence and we want to explain why, in a world in which global warming is a fact at this point and not something that is going to be easily avoided, we think it is beneficial for states to invest in unconventional oil such as oil sands and tar and things of that nature.

Moving forward.

Ok.

So firstly, under energy independence we want to talk about monopolies and opec.

So we think that outside of unconventional oil possessions, most oil, most conventional oil, is controlled by the opec monopoly.

And we think that the opec monopoly is a net bad in the world for a few reasons.

Firstly, the countries that compose opec, largely countries in the middle east, authoritarian countries, gain immense amounts of political clout because of the monopoly that they have in the status quo.

Opec, essentially, is able to act as a cartel and it gives more political power to regions and to countries that are bad countries in the world.

What we mean by bad countries are these are home these are nations that fundamentally do not respect the rights of their citizens.

Countries like saudi arabia, countries like venezuela, countries where human rights are not respected, where women's rights are not respected, and we think that because they have this monopoly on oil there is very little that the international world can do to try and combat the human rights abuses that take place in these states because they can raise the prices of oil or they can embargo their oil like happened in the united states under jimmy carter where an oil embargo took place and opec refused to sell to the united states.

We think by exploiting unconventional sources of oil more international action can be taken against these countries which is a good, and further we think that opec is essentially a price manipulator which means that the prices that are being charged in the status quo for conventional oil do not match what a fair market would breed.

So we think that unconventional oil also has its benefits outside of opec.

We think that firstly, unconventional oil increases the supply of oil and it drives down prices for everyone.

This means that even if you aren't working in the industry, that your oil prices are going to go down and that there are large benefits for all citizens with a nation because everyone is either on the grid that is powered by conventional oil or uses products such as cars that require this type of oil.

We also think that it incentivizes businesses and job creation if you exploit unconventional oil.

In the status quo, the US job market and other job markets are doing fairly well but they've started to stagnate especially for unskilled workers.

We think that introducing unconventional oil industry is getting to increase jobs particularly for people like these people that have been pushed out of manual labor fields, such as mining and other areas, we think that unconventional oil can bring jobs back to those unskilled laborers in particular which is something that we think the economy desperately needs.

Finally we think that energy independence keeps profits in the country.

In the status quo, oil profits, for the most part, go outside of the country.

They're lost to our GDP and the money that otherwise could of been reinvested by putting that money in american pockets by providing it to american job creators, or you know domestic job creators, that money can then be reinvested further into the market and can gradually increase the GDP as money continues to be exchanged.

We think that that is a preferable world to the one in which all of our oil money, all the money that is spent in conventional oil, billions of dollars every year, continues to flood outside of the domestic economy and we think that we get a all around healthier economy and all around better economy especially for unskilled workers if we invest in unconventional oil.

We recognize that global warming is a problem but we don't think that this is a meaningful tipping point in making it worse, and for these reasons we should further exploit unconventional oil.

"
"daniel_2185_unconventional-oil_pro_opening","2185","PRO","daniel","","We should further exploit unconventional oil for two big reasons: first, because the further exploitation of unconventional oil will lead to a drop in oil prices, which will make just about everything in our lives cheaper, and secondarily, because it'll give us independence from foreign oil, which is certainly beneficial from a like geopolitical perspective, from a strategic perspective in international relations.

So, let's start by talking about why this is going to lead to a drop in the prices of oil, and why that's so important.

So, it's going to lead to a drop in the prices of oil because you're just going to have more of a supply of it.

There's a lot of untapped things, like oil sands, or like shale oil, things like that, that are being extracted, and there's a lot of new opportunities for more advanced ways to extract oil, which is leading to a large surplus of oil, which is what's leading to the price drops in oil.

This is incredibly important, because cheaper oil prices doesn't merely means that, your cars are going to be able to go to places for less money, although that is very important, sense most americans commute to work and get a lot of their day-to-day provisions through their car, so that is very important.

This also affects things like public transportation, and a lot of other sources of transportation.

It also affects things like basic heating and cooking costs, as a lot of places, especially in the northeast, use oil for their heating.

It also affects just about anything that uses plastic, so plastics are used in almost everything in day to day lives.

Plastics use oil, so when the price of oil goes down, the price of anything that uses plastic also goes down.

At the end of the day, these costs pile up a lot, and a decrease in the price of oil means that, it's just much easier for the average person to live the their day to day lives, because the cost of living just goes down, they're able to do things on a lighter budget, which is just very helpful for people in an economy, it's a great way to get an economy going.

But, the second thing that I want to talk about is about foreign oil and about how this is going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

So, first like principally, if all of the reasons that I talked about in my last point, about how important oil price stability, and especially if they can be lower, how important those are to an economy, because how much they affect the day to day life.

Those are very very important things that, you don't want to have based on the whims of an oil cartel like opec.

Because, if they decide that they want to increase oil prices, or do something to increase the prices of oil, what this means is that, they essentially have control over your economy, because they're able to make things more expensive for every person that is in your economy.

That's an incredible degree of control that another government is going to have over you, which means that they can use that leverage against you, to try to like get more favorable like business proposals in some cases , looking the other way on, possibly, human rights abuses that may be happening, support for more despotic regimes, there's all kinds of ways, in which foreign governments can use this as leverage, in order to get what they want out of governments like the united states.

And, that's incredibly problematic, because it can undermine your values, it can undermine your economic interests, and it undermines the economic livelihoods of the citizens in your country.

So, that's like very very bad also.

There's also the more tenuous idea, about how you don't want this to be like, maybe linked to terrorist organizations or things like that either, which can also be the result of like state funded terrorism, which can also sometimes happen when you are purchasing from certain countries in the middle east.

And this is also sometimes a problem, like a lot of like members of the saudi arabian government have been linked to terrorist like have been linked to funding terrorism and things like this.

These are also things that , you're not going that many problems if you're trying to use unconventional oil, things like oil shales, like in canada or north dakota, or things like that.

So, for all of those reasons, very very proud to propose.

"
"james_2402_guantanamo_con_opening_tim","2402","CON","james","tim","We should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp.

We're going to explain to you why the united states should continue to operate gitmo and should continue the programs that are under way there, including the CIA torture program.

Three arguments: the first is that the alternative to closing guantanamo bay is not better than the status quo.

Tim tries to tell you in his speech that if we close guantanamo bay, the CIA will stop torturing people, the US navy will stop interring people without trial, and ultimately these people will either be set free or given fair and free trials.

I just don't think that this is a realistic alternative world to the one in which we live.

There is no incentive for the US government to end the torture program.

Yes, there has been backlash against it, but it was relatively minor and ultimately has blown over, especially since the trump election.

And on top of that, presumably the US government gained something from the torture program, whether that be making people afraid to interfere with US business or perhaps obtaining some information that they otherwise don't have.

If they didn't gain anything from it, then I think it's unlikely the CIA would spend money on this program.

So with that in mind, I think it's quite likely that they'll just continue the program, and what would it look like without guantanamo bay?

The US operates many torture facilities around the world.

Perhaps you remember the scandal at abu gharib a few years ago where US, I believe it was the navy, were mistreating prisoners and torturing them to get information.

If you close guantanamo bay, all that happens is they do the torture in saudi arabia or some other country.

At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter where it happens.

But at least with guantanamo, this is in the news and the american people are aware of it.

There's some degree of oversight.

If this all takes place at some black site in poland, then the potential for abuse is much greater, and ultimately we tell you that the situation could grow even worse than it is right now.

Torture, unfortunately, seems to be a fact of life for people who are held in these navy and CIA prisons, and it seems that that's unlikely to go away.

Our second argument is that it is politically infeasible to close guantanamo bay.

Recognize that this action doesn't take place in a vacuum.

If you close gitmo, either you have to move these people to black sites, basically disappear them, which seems quite likely to cause backlash in the liberal media and ultimately create more resentment of the government and of the CIA among the kind of liberal, big city east coast types who care about these things.

Ultimately, we tell you that there's no reason for any administration to take on that backlash when people seem perfectly willing to ignore guantanamo for the most part.

We think ultimately this would just burn good political will for the administration.

Or alternatively you could try to move these people to america, like barack obama did.

But every single governor refused to have these people come to their state because they don't want to bring nine eleven hijackers into their community.

So at the end of the day, we think that it's likely that you would get similar backlash and have the same problems if you try to bring them to america.

So we just don't think that there's any good way to do this without burning a lot of political will on an issue that most americans, to be frank, don't care about.

Our third and final argument is that these concessions to cuba would weaken our soft power.

Cuba has wanted america to leave the guantanamo bay base since nineteen fifty nine, or whenever the castros came to power.

We tell you that ultimately if you make concessions to cuba, you weaken american soft power.

The ability of a very strong country to say, "" we will do whatever we want in your territory and you can't stop us "", is one way that nations like the US dissuade anyone from disagreeing with their hegemony.

We see the same thing in germany or in japan: that the US bases there provide a way for the US to leverage their position as a global hegemon.

Even if the navy remains in guantanamo bay, removing the prison camp is a major concession to the cubans, who have called it a human rights abuse, and ultimately undermines our negotiating position in the region and perhaps globally.

So for all these reasons, we should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp.

Thank you.

"
"tim_2402_guantanamo_con_opening_daniel","2402","CON","tim","daniel","We should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp.

So we have two main arguments they we're gonna make in this debate.

The first is about the usefulness of guantanamo bay and the second is about the problems that arise if we were to take this type of action, and why these two things combined outweigh any sort of argument in favor of the protections of people within guantanamo bay.

So firstly, on usefulness.

So many people complain that this type of detention center goes against international law, goes against united states laws, about procedural law, right to trial, right to a trial by peers, all these types of things, and so we're gonna deal with those arguments first about why we think the usefulness exists and why these laws don't apply.

So on laws in the united states - firstly it's clearly the case that as these are not US citizens they don't have the same rights embodied within the constitution not applied to them.

These are rights that are only guaranteed to US citizens and therefore those arguments don't really come into play in this debate.

But more importantly on international law - recognize that the state first has an obligation to its citizens.

While international law and treaties that the treaties that compose international law are just and are useful in things such as war and international cooperation, the state has a foremost obligation to protect its citizens and in keeping people in guantanamo bay, these are people that are overwhelmingly dangerous actors who, let's recognize, you're dealing primarily with extremists who aren't going to respect the laws of war that are governing how we are how we ought to treat them.

If these individuals aren't willing to reciprocate the obligations of those treaties, if they aren't willing to reciprocate those obligations and the norms of international law, we think they are willing a world in which those same rights are not given to them.

Because of this we think that any argument that's made about international law making guantanamo bay a bad center, something that unjustly restricts the rights of these individuals, we think they have created that world through their extremist actions and because of that are not deserving of these rights.

We it also recognized as useful simply in the fact that it allows for the containment very dangerous people.

Even if not, even if there isn't obvious legal evidence because legal procedure and the proceedings that prove guilt in a court aren't always available to show that these people are guilty, there's often overwhelming evidence against these people in other regards.

And even if it is the case that these people are not always the guilty individuals that we believe they are, given the fact that these people, when they are guilty, are likely individuals that are going to carry out incredibly damaging and incredibly violent acts, we think it is the obligation of the united states to take the risk to contain these individuals.

So secondly we wanna talk about the problems with release.

So what do we think would happen if we were to take this?

So, most of the people that are in guantanamo bay, as I just pointed out, are incredibly dangerous.

Which means if you would have a trial in public, that trial would become an incredibly obvious target for violence.

We think that extremists and other terrorist organizations would rally around that individual event to make some sort of statement.

To show the the flaws in the legal system in the united states, to create some sort of propaganda moment, we think that this is an incredibly obvious target and we think it would likely involve individuals who are innocent, people that are citizens of the state, being hurt.

Secondly, most prisons simply don't want to have these targets.

They can't ensure the safety of these people when they are in prisons because of the high profile nature of them as criminals, as extremists.

We think they're likely to have violence put against them within jail and we think that prisons simply don't want to take them.

And finally there's an obvious harm of returning them to their home country.

If you release them, if you let them go back to their home countries, it allows them to go back to the activities that led to them being in guantanamo in the first place.

We think that this ensures that there are more extremists in the world that are likely to take damaging acts, violent acts against united states' citizens.

The job of the united states government is first and foremost to protect its citizens and we believe that guantanamo bay does a better job of that if it were not to exist.

For these reasons we should not we should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp.

"
"tim_2402_guantanamo_pro_opening","2402","PRO","tim","","We should close the guantanamo bay detention camp.

So, we want to be clear about how we think this is going to occur.

There are still dozens of the individuals that are that are interned in guantanamo bay, and we're going to have two main prongs to our model.

The first is that if trials are possible, if there's enough evidence that someone could even feasibly go to trial, we would put these people on trial, we would do this in a civilian rather than a military court, because we think there are there's more openness, there's more opportunity for people to get a fair defense in the civilian court, and therefore we think that this is only just, especially given that these individuals are for the most part not military members.

And secondly, if there isn't enough evidence to even bring these individuals to trial, we would say that they would just be returned to their homes, will be given will be put back into their home country and they would be allowed to go free.

Ok.

Two main arguments.

The first is on morality, and the second is on legalism and international relations.

So on morality.

We think that most prisoners in guantanamo bay are currently held without substantial evidence to charge them, or any sort of real reason that they are in there.

They didn't deserve the internment that they're currently experiencing, and on top of the fact that they are being detained, which in and of itself is unjust, the conditions of their detainment is simply inhumane and what this means is that people are denied basic human rights, and are given are subject to things such as torture that go against major international law, and go against our fundamental moral code.

We think that, from a deontological framework, human beings are not deserving of this kind of inhumane treatment, and this can be seen as codified in liberal democracies across the world.

And even if you want to take on a utilitarian framework of morality, torture is shown time and again to be an ineffective means of getting information from people, of getting information that could stop terrorist attacks or things of this nature, and given that there's no real gain to torturing and detaining these individuals in this prison, we don't think that there's any sort of moral justification to leave them interned.

But the second thing we want talk about is the international relations surrounding guantanamo bay, and why it's so problematic for the united states.

So firstly, the united states, over its history, has constructed a large amount of the current international law such that exists in the world, such as the geneva conventions and certain human rights conventions that have been signed onto by the united states.

We would say that in a world in which guantanamo bay exists, the united states loses the moral high ground that allows it to enforce those international laws.

It means that when american citizens and american civilians are detained by states that these people are subject to torture and are subject to poor treatment by these states, and this means that in having guantanamo bay, without any sort of positive gains from it, it puts americans at risk of the inhumane treatment that we cause to others.

It also angers many people in the international world from individuals from individual countries in europe, which if you are a human rights treatment is abhorrent, to middle eastern and north african countries whose citizens are subject to detainment in guantanamo bay.

This means that in that individual countries are less likely to want to work with the united states in the international sphere, and it means the united states loses much of its standing abroad.

Finally, we think that guantanamo bay, for the most part, serves as propaganda for terror cells in the status quo.

Terrorists can point to guantanamo bay to show that this the united states doesn't care about human rights, it doesn't care about civilians that aren't their own civilians, and they can paint the united states as this great evil, and show the factual evidence of guantanamo bay as a site where torture routinely takes place and human rights are routinely ignored.

Given that it causes immense international harms, and that morally guantanamo bay is repugnant and unjustifiable, we should close the guantanamo bay detention camp.

"
"daniel_2402_guantanamo_pro_opening","2402","PRO","daniel","","We should close the guantanamo bay detention camp because it is immoral, it's bad policy, and it ultimately just makes everything worse, and it makes the problem it's allegedly trying to solve, like terrorism, a lot worse.

So let's start by talking about why it's immoral.

I think this is rather obvious.

Guantanamo bay detention camp was specifically created to be immoral.

It was created to be immoral in that it was a place where it would be outside of regular US jurisdiction, where people could be detained indefinitely, where people didn't have any right to things like habeas corpus where they can demand reason for why they are being detained.

It could be indefinite, there wouldn't be any kind of, trial there wouldn't be any kinds of appeals.

Interrogation methods could be as hostile or torturous as you want them to be, so it could be something like torture, it could be worse.

The guards could humiliate people, and there's no real way to actually ensure that these people are being treated fairly, with dignity and respect, that these people are actually guilty of any kind of crime, that these people actually know where their life is going to be going, and things like that.

So, obviously those are by themselves pretty bad reasons and immoral reason, the reason why that we have protections against all of those things in in any kind of like liberal democracy is because we look at those things as grotesque, as essentially the epitome of injustice.

Arbitrary convictions, arbitrary sentences, arbitrary imprisonment, and all of these things, it's essentially the definition of despotism, and that's very, very bad.

But I also think that this is bad on an international stage in a couple of ways.

First because it a lot of countries get very angry about that, and rightly so.

Obviously cuba's angry because this is essentially land that should belong to cuba, and it's basically like like if cuba was operating a detention facility for communist dissidents in like key west, florida, I imagine the US would probably be pretty annoyed about that, like it's like fair, it's not something that they want happening right on their shorelines.

But additionally, I think that this is also bad a a level for like allies, and people like that oftentimes condemn it because it's seen as very, very rights-violative.

But finally, it's also bad because it's ultimate very powerful as a propaganda tool that shows why people like the united states need be fought in the first place.

And they need to be fought because they engage in immoral tactics, because they do things like torture muslims, throw them into prisons without any kind of hope of without any actual knowing of that being guilty, not really caring who it is or what they actually did, during this to possibly innocent people, and maybe never returning them to home or if they do return to home, possibly after they've been tortured for something that they didn't do.

I can see why people get annoyed about that, and I can see why people can get radicalized about these kinds of things over time.

So, for all those reasons, close guantanamo bay.

"rachel_2481_fraternities_con_opening_will","2481","CON","rachel","will","Don't ban fraternities.

Three main areas of clash: first I want to talk about how a lot of the problems that will attributed to fraternities aren't actually endemic to them, and will continue even worse if you ban fraternities.

Recognize that the reasons that all of these issues are present at frat parties is because frat parties have become the dominant party supplier.

The only other get-togethers tend to be more personal invite only kind of situations, where necessarily the fact that you have less strangers and less people willing to report etcetera means there's going to be less sexual assault and less binge drinking etcetera.

These issues however, sexual assaults, over drinking, all of that are endemic to party culture not necessarily to frats.

As long as students demand parties all they do is displace these same harms onto smaller dis institutionalized parties.

The only solution for these kinds of situations is basically what colleges have already been employing which are heavy education campaigns that advocate for consent, bystander training, like all of these things that actually change the mindsets of individual people rather than just saying: "" look, because we've banned this one institution everything is solved "".

We think the problem on their side of the house is that they're creating a false sense of solvency, in which people think the issue is gone because frats are now banned, when in reality it remains just as there and just as pertinent as ever.

We think currently when you have an institution you can watch, regulate and target them much easier.

You can warn people specifically about frat parties and how you can take care of yourself there.

You can offer them perks for calling ubers and specify trainings that are targeted towards them.

We prefer a centralized system because it's reliable and easy to regulate.

Insofar as schools are just infinitely like going to be watching frats a lot closer than other people, we think that they're going to be more capable of decreasing the harmful effects than if all of those same parties just became like, just became in different locations with different groups of individuals that they're not used to observing.

But our second area of clash is how it becomes more pernicious.

Yes, it's bad that frats are exclusionary and providing social networking only to those who can afford it, but rich people will always find a way to separate themselves through other means.

Recognize things like the finals clubs at harvard are literally just a response to the fact that frats and things like that were told to desegregate and be more inclusive and then they were like: "" ha, guess what, we're just gonna create finals clubs that are institutionalized with all of your best donors so that we can get away with this "".

We think that these situations are even worse, because now they don't need university support to exist.

They essentially divested themselves from university infrastructure, rely on massive donors that the university doesn't want to piss off either, and it means that you can't actually have any sort of meaningful changing in terms of social norms or requiring better treatment or requiring bystander training.

We prefer frats because they're under over university oversight.

There is some level of influence there.

You can actually force some rules like party logging and making sure you know where all the parties are.

Things like that.

Our third area of clash is just why fraternities can be incredibly helpful and thus people ought be able to choose them.

Recognize that college is incredibly difficult, especially when you are first transitioning your freshman year.

Frats provide a meaningful community that help people through hard times.

And recognize that there's no objective way in which we adjust or go through this difficult time in our life.

Like there's no one way to go to college and make it.

Rather, every individual finds their own community and group of people, maybe they don't find anyone at all, that helps them through an incredibly difficult transitory period.

Some people use school clubs, others use frats.

But both of these are equally valid options and something the provides with a supportive community in times of need.

We think that everyone deserves that and we don't think that it's the job of universities to regulate it insofar as it takes those options away from students.

We also just think that like having somewhere where like maybe there is an institutional history of like your parents knew them, like there's more oversight.

It is really helpful for individuals who are away from home for the first time for a long period of time.

And also like insofar as they have to get their social networking somewhere, were unsure why any of these harms are unique.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"daniel_2481_fraternities_con_opening_james","2481","CON","daniel","james","We should not ban frats becasue banning frats won't do any good, it unfairly targets frats and the consequences will actually be a whole lot worse.

Let's start by talking about why the consequences of banning frats will be worse.

And I think that the biggest reason for this is because you can ban oficial affiliation with frats, you can ban frats being on school campuses, and you can refuse to endorse them but you can't actually ban frats in their totality.

What this would ultimately create if you tried to ban frats is a situation like you see it places like brandeis where frats aren't formally recognized but but nevertheless exist in an informal capacity off campus because like obviously you can't stop people from getting houses off campus with their friends and having people over and you can't stop people from just like associating with other people as individuals off campus that's like a clear like constitutional issue their freedom of association.

So there's really nothing that you can actually do about banning fraternities in an off campus informal capacity, so really the comparative is would you rather have fraternities be on campus in a more fashion that is easier to regulate or would you rather them be off campus in a more informal capacity.

And I think it's obvious that it's better to have them on campus because when they're off campus, first and foremost university health and safety resources aren't going to be able to readily access.

You can't call university police, you have to call regular police if there's any problems there which most people are unwilling to do because they're afraid of consequences.

Same with EMT's and paramedics, people are probably more willing to reach out to their university for resources than actual authorities where they may be worried about consequences.

When they're off campus you're not able to get things like bartenders, you're not able to make sure that there's like people monitoring the event because they're happening in like a safer area rather than in like a basement in some random person's house half a mile away from campus.

So all of those things make it more likely that the worst things that frats do are just going to escalate, whether it's hazing, whether it's sexual assault, whether it's like other problematic behaviors, those things aren't going to go away they're just going to get worse because now they're happening in a less regulatable fashion.

But the next thing that I want to talk about is about how this unfairly targets frats anyway, because obviously all of the problematic things that fraternities do whether it's hazing whether it's like contributing to rape culture or anything like that anything that you could name that a frat does that's bad isn't necessarily unique to the frat.

Obviously sexual assaults and things like that don't just happen in fraternities, don't just happen at frat parties.

They're a part of like a widespread culture and I don't think that getting rid of frats is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like the way that like women feel safe on campus probably much more effective would be just like trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic rather than just trying to ban organizations that that like contribute to these kinds of things.

You're not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like attacking a symptom of it or like a method of it.

But I think also beyond that obviously there's other organizations that operate similarly there is hazing in like parties and things like that for sports teams, like other clubs and things like that do that do that too like the brandeis debate teams has throne parties before like so obviously like you can't just like fully regulate these kinds of behaviors it's simply an impossible thing to do and it would be an unfair thing to do because ultimately frats engage in similar behaviors to a lot of other entities.

So for all those reasons, don't ban frats.

"
"will_2481_fraternities_pro_opening","2481","PRO","will","","I'm proud to support the motion that we should ban fraternities.

Three independent points.

First is the culture of abuse that exists within frat life and greek life in general.

We think that because fraternities are often hierarchies that are this that put students at the top that particularly put like adolescents that often don't have a good sense of you know control over how like a party might go or even have much experience and sort of managing this type of things, things can often spiral out of control.

It is difficult for a frat to say essentially you know we are going to draw a line in the sand during the party, this is something that is going on that we don't approve of something like under age drinking something like sexual assault.

We think then the because frats don't have the institutional basis to actually intervene meaningfully in the situations they are ill equipped to supervise these types of scenarios.

But what we specifically see is frats as being significantly worse at doing than just like your standard run of the mill party is the culture that surrounds greek life.

We think that there is often an assumption that you know frats can just sort of have a no rules approach to things that it's all like this very hedonistic kind of mindset but the problem with that of course is that like when you take this mindset, when you take the mindset of being in a frat means having whatever you want, that often enables very pernicious behavior.

So things like sexual assaults are significantly more common at fraternity parties than other types of parties because they are being run by people who are operating under the assumption that anyone who is at the party is essentially subject to their will, that they are running the show and as a result are entitled to individual people who are present there.

We think this is inherently problematic and we think that this is inseparable from the nature of fraternities and as a result justifies a ban.

Our second independent point though is that fraternities as institutions in general result in regressive networking.

So what we mean by this is that a lot of what op is probably going to tell you is that fraternities are good because it provides networking opportunities to young professionals that people who are trying to meet individuals with similar interests like particularly in the business sector often use fraternities to establish those ties.

But we think this is inherently an issue because fraternities being the basis by which these networks are created being a symbol of like elite rigor in institutions inherently tilts that perception of this is a person who is in x organization thus has credibility in favor of men.

If this is something that fraternities uniquely access it becomes something that gives an advantage to men unjustly.

We think that by banning fraternities and by extension by banning these networks from being disproportionately tilted towards men we reduce the fundamental basis for inequity in the workplace that is that from the starting gate men often have networks that enable them to get into positions of higher authority and higher employment that women just don't have access to because of the tilted nature of greek life.

Our third and final independent point though is really to preempt something that we think op is going to say that is that by banning fraternities are just like push them off campus they're just going to do even worse things without university supervision.

We think in general that argument is something that falls because universities don't do much to supervise them right now but more importantly is that we think that the ban on fraternities will send a valuable signal that is the university is specifically putting a stamp of disapproval on fraternities as an institution saying this is something with problematic, this is something that is dangerous.

We think that is a, going to help a lot of students who aren't in fraternities particularly like incoming students say maybe this is something I shouldn't associate myself with maybe I shouldn't go to these parties because this is something that has been explicitly labeled as problematic and dangerous for me.

But secondly we think it's useful because even if fraternities will continue to try to exist off campus, we think that stamp of disapproval that societal signal from the university will be valuable in in the long run mitigating their influence.

Proud to propose.

"
"james_2481_fraternities_pro_opening","2481","PRO","james","","We should ban fraternities.

By this we mean to say that american colleges and universities should ban fraternities and sororities.

These are single-sex social clubs which usually own houses on a university campus, where their members live, which host kind of raucous parties and other social events for their members and their friends, and which generally serve as the main social focus on campus.

We have a few reasons why we think these fraternities should be banned, by which we mean they should be shut down by their universities and have their houses taken away.

First, fraternities are by their very nature exclusive.

They're almost all open to only people of one sex, and many of them exclude transgender people and intersex people.

Defenders of fraternities will point out that some have recently become multigender or more accepting, but this doesn't really change the problem.

These fraternities have a limited number of spots and they recruit people based on how much they appeal socially to the existing members, which means that because these fraternities were founded as drinking clubs for rich white boys, they're going to remain drinking clubs for rich white boys.

Maybe now they let in one or two asians or jews but that doesn't really change their very nature.

These go back to very exclusive, racist clubs designed to perpetuate the old american elite in the early twentieth century.

And even if not all fraternities act that way, all fraternities are modeled on groups that exist to this end, and we don't think that they should be allowed to continue to do so.

In particular, as we begin to encourage more inclusivity and less racism and less biased behavior, basically, on college campuses, it's contradictory to let organizations that exist to promote bias remain, organizations that entrench bullying through hazing in their selection processes.

Our second argument is that fraternities promote a bad culture on college campuses.

I already mentioned hazing and bullying.

The fraternity selection process, by its very nature, strips people of many of their essential characteristics, and then judges them based on how much they appeal to the people who are already members.

Essentially, the popular kids choose who gets to be a member of their club.

So bullying is baked into the system but what's more, because they choose who can and can't come to their parties, they effectively control access to alcohol for underage drinkers on campus.

Fraternities use this control over alcohol to lure young women to their houses, get them drunk, and then take advantage of them sexually.

This is why there are so many rape and sexual assault charges associated with fraternities.

Some studies indicate that being a member of a fraternity indicates that someone is twice as likely to commit sexual assault as not being a member of a fraternity.

So we think that it's clear that because they're encouraging bullying and much worse, because they're encouraging sexual assault, that they should be banned.

The increased rates of rape and sexual assault that happen because of fraternities are enough reason in themselves to ban these organizations, and nothing the other side says about how they create brotherhood or encourage volunteer work is going to outweigh this.

And our final point is that fraternities and sororities hinder learning on campus.

Universities exists to educate young citizens, but because fraternities often encourage their members to drink all the time instead of do work, because they help their members to cheat in order to get through school without actually learning, we think that they actually undermine the educational goals of the university.

Many fraternities do things like save old versions of exams so that their members can study them or get answers to questions from members who are older than them in the fraternity, which lets people skirt around having to do actual work and actually learn, so that they have more time to drink cheap beer and try to knock up freshman girls.

So because they prevent learning, because of the extremely harmful culture that they create, and because they're so exclusive, we should ban fraternities.

Thank you.

"
"james_2483_anonymous-posts_con_opening_daniel","2483","CON","james","daniel","We should not ban anonymous posting online.

Three arguments for our side: the first is about freedom of speech.

We think that ultimately, people in almost every country in the world are guaranteed the ability to speak their mind.

When you require someone to attach their name and face, such as by linking every comment that people make to a facebook profile or something similar to online comments, you abridge that freedom of speech.

We see that this is already acknowledged by courts around the world to the point that doxing - the practice of releasing someone's personal information without their permission - is a crime or has been banned in many jurisdictions.

The reason why this limits people's freedom of speech so much is because by attaching your identity to something you open yourself up to attack.

This means that people will be afraid to speak their mind, more on this in just a minute, and that people won't be able to access the kinds of open fora that characterized the internet right now.

We think that one of the best things about the internet now is anonymous posting, because it lets people have conversations that otherwise wouldn't exist.

So you silence a tremendous amount of speech by banning this anonymous posting.

And the other side might tell you that it isn't speech that we want.

That it's online bullying or people behaving anti-socially, but I don't think they can make that claim categorically that this never has value, for reasons I'll explain now.

Our second argument is about the benefits of anonymous posting to closeted or otherwise marginalized communities.

Imagine that you are gay in iran.

How are you supposed to talk about your experiences with like minded individuals without anonymous posting?

We tell you that ultimately people whose ideas are not accepted by wider society or whose identities are not accepted but wider society, benefit enormously from online posting.

I think one reason why there are so many more people with diverse identities out in the open today than there were thirty years ago, is that people can find community online in a way that they can't in person.

People don't feel comfortable talking about things like sexuality or gender identity if they live in a conservative country or a conservative area of a country, so they don't have a community to access.

Anonymous posting lets people safely talk about identities that are marginalized or discriminated against.

It lets people who otherwise lack community, create community.

And this eventually spills over into the real world.

When people realize that they are not alone, that other people have the same experiences as them, that what they are feeling is okay and not something that should be, they should be ashamed of, than they are much more likely to be able to come forward and talk about those ideas in public.

We think that anonymous posting and anonymous communities ultimately beget real world communities which then can advocate for social change and acceptance.

Now the other team is going to say it's not just gay kids using the internet.

It's also people like the far right or political activists who want harmful things or isis or groups like that.

But those people already existed anyway just like gay people already existed.

So you don't get rid of isis, you don't get rid of neo-nazis by banning anonymous posting.

And for reasons I'll explain in just a minute, you don't even limit their activity by banning this kind of posting.

So we think that ultimately the benefits that accrue to marginalized groups greatly outweigh the harms caused by isis posting on twitter occasionally.

Our final argument is that these laws would be unenforceable if they were introduced.

There is no way that any one country can implement an end to anonymous posting.

Even china, with their attempts to cut off their internet from the rest of the world, had been unable to stop people from using IPN's or other ways of circumventing the great firewall of china as they call it.

The nature of the internet is that no one country can regulate it.

So ultimately as long as people can set up an anonymous server in tuvalu or some other tiny country, you won't be able to enforce this laws.

Which makes your government look weak and foolish and ultimately reduces the respect that people have for it.

We tell you that the kinds of extremist you might want to stop from talking online are still able to do so therefore, so there's no successful effect of this policy.

For all these reasons we should not ban anonymous posting.

Thank you.

"
"will_2483_anonymous-posts_con_opening_james","2483","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should ban anonymous posting.

Our first independent point is that this is largely unenforceable.

A lot of what gov discusses regarding illegal materials, such as you know like pirated movies but it also like more pernicious things like child pornography, are largely circulated on sites that are themselves illegal, like the pirate bay.

This is a problem then because it is very difficult to enforce a law like this on a site that itself is already in violation of the law by virtue of its own existence.

So we don't think that these sites are going to comply.

But even with regards to other sites, like facebook and you know like they talk about 4chan for example, I think there is one, the problem of international enforcement that is that these sites exist across state borders so it will be extremely difficult for individual governments to make these requirements.

But secondly, that these requirements even once successfully enforced are easy to evade.

The best version of the model that gov puts forward is tying it to a facebook account.

But facebook accounts can also be anonymous because you can just make like a facebook account with like a name and a photo that's not of you.

So then this itself is a problem because it means that there's no actual way to insure that every single person has like their identity tied to them.

The only way that you can really do you this is just to like automatically dox everybody by like tying each like account to the IP address that it uses.

Obviously this is a huge rights violation for reasons I'll get into later but also with regards to the doxing argumentation put forward by gov like this would just be a ridiculously awful thing to do to people.

Our second independent point is free speech.

So this is specifically why we think that there is a proactive right to be anonymous on the internet.

We think that often people need to maintain anonymity from, a, fear of retaliation against opinions that are expressed.

For example, opposition viewpoints on a thread that is like largely in favor of one particular position require individuals to be anonymous out of fear of like direct physical offline retaliation.

If I were to post like for example a pro-hillary post on like r slash the donald, it probably wouldn't go over too well and anonymity is necessary then for me to comfortably express myself in that forum.

But secondly we think that there is a like fundamental right to remain anonymous on the basis that we think that opinion should just be expressed regardless of you know like we don't think that you need to tie your name to something to be to be capable of expressing an opinion.

The reason that we care about free speech is simply because it's facilitative to other rights.

You need to put your opinions out there so that governments and the public are aware that there is support for a specific ideology and can respond appropriately.

This is especially true with governments.

So we don't think then that it's necessary to tie that opinion to a specific person to exercise that right.

Rather this is something that can very easily exist in the abstract and we think that principally we should maintain people's capacity to represent those opinions anonymously.

Our third independent point in just briefly but the way in we think that because this is a fundamental right this outweighs like the discursive arguments that gov makes like these are very much like a like the discourse stuff is very much a drop in the bucket when compared to something like a fundamental right to free speech.

Our third independent point is the right to be forgotten.

So we think that because a person is defined by their preferences and their opinions that like this fundamentally is what makes me distinct from other people, your past self can be considered fundamentally distinct from your present self.

Your preferences and the basics thoughts and ideas that make up who you are change over time.

So we think then that it is unfair for someone's past actions to fundamentally determine the current perceptions of them.

Given that, we think that anonymity is important because it preserves people's right to be forgotten.

That is that their present self doesn't have to suffer for the actions taken by their past self.

Even from a perspective that doesn't make these into distinct individuals we still think it is fundamentally unjust the way that the internet has a tendency to like stir up people's pasts and use it against them.

That fundamentally then can be protected by anonymity.

Proud to oppose.

"
"will_2483_anonymous-posts_pro_opening","2483","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban anonymous posts.

The enforcement mechanism will basically be to just shut down websites that allow anonymous posting.

So you know presumably most sites associated with large firms will obviously just comply with this.

You know sites like twitter for example that allow just sort of like egg accounts or youtube which can allow for anonymous commenting.

We would say that this always has to be associated with like an actual person and we were just outright shut down sites that are completely predicated upon anonymous posting so like yik yak and things like that.

Two independent points.

First is that anonymous posting allows for more vitriolic online discourse and that this is inherently problematic.

I think there's really two ways in which this breaks down.

So broadly what happens here is that because people are able to hide behind an anonymous shield and they're not you know particularly accountable for whatever it is that they say, they're more likely to say things that are deliberately inflammatory or deliberately offensive either just because they think they can get away with it and they genuinely hold those views or because they're just trying to be inflammatory and just trying to get a rise out of somebody.

So then the two ways really that we see this breaking down and causing harm is first is the personal harms that people are more likely to target individuals and you know actually harass them online.

So I think one particularly good example of this is the way that leslie jones was harassed on twitter you know having rachel racial epitaphs slurred at her and misogynists epitaphs.

So this type of harassment is directly facilitated by anonymous commenting because people don't have to remain accountable for what it is that they're saying but secondly, there's the discursive harm that broadly online discourse becomes more vitriolic, becomes were confrontational, because there is this norm set around the internet that people are just going to be more aggressive when they're behind an anonymous shield.

We think that to an extent this still happens even when you're not personally face to face with the individual but it is significantly and even exponentially more problematic when there is no way for there to be any sort of accountability for these types of actions.

Because the discourse shifts to be more vitriolic on the internet when there's that anonymous component, we think there's a more long lasting effect on our societal discourse patterns in that we are you know more likely to be combative with one another in that we are you more likely to see others as the enemy and less willing to you know rationalize with another because of just sort of the way that online commenting has shaped the way that our society talks with one another.

The second independent point that I'd like to advance is a general lack of accountability for actions.

So just beyond sort of the ways in which this affects how we talk to one another there's also the broader issue of accountability.

First, I think this is something that just principled issue that when we speak we should be accountable for the things that we say.

We want individual you know sentences and sentiments to be tied to an individual because we only care about things being expressed in the first place because there is an individual behind that sentiment.

We think that when sentiments just kind of come out of the ether because they're voiced by anonymous trolls or whatever that's a problem, because that means that there really significant portions of our societal discourse that don't have an actual source, that don't stem from an individual person.

But we also think that that lack of you know connection to an individual person is harmful for law enforcement reasons.

That anonymity on the internet has you know made it very difficult to enforce things like say hate crime laws because you can essentially target people anonymously.

You are less accountable from a legal perspective to answer for your actions and to answer for the the harm you have placed on society by encouraging this type of discourse and by incurring these types of harms on people.

Proud to propose.

"james_2483_anonymous-posts_pro_opening","2483","PRO","james","","We should ban anonymous posts.

So what we're arguing is that websites like reddit or four chan should not allow people to post anonymously, they should require them to log in with their real name.

We would be fine with using something like facebook as a way to authenticate people's identity or even having some sort of government issued identity which people will be required to use when they post online.

Three arguments for our side: the first is about tracking crime.

Imagine how much more difficult it would be to distribute illegal materials if everything you posted online were directly linked to your name.

If I had to go and post james l.

Next every pirated movie I've ever watched, then it's probably much less likely that I'd be willing to engage in that behavior.

And pirated movies are honestly the least of our concerns on the internet.

When there are people out there distributing indecent photos of minors or drug paraphernalia or lots of other things that they couldn't distribute in person, we think that ultimately it's very difficult to track and limit if their distribution is anonymous.

If everyone had to use their real name and if there were no way to get around this, then ultimately we think it would be easier for law enforcement to go after these people.

I think that in particular, for indecent material concerning children, this is just so outrageous that it's been allowed to go on in the name of allowing anonymity.

It's essential that government step in to do something in order to protect children who are being harmed and in order to go after the people who are creating and distributing this heinous material.

We think that that, in and of itself, is enough to ban these anonymous posts.

Our second argument is about self censorship.

You may have asked yourself, if you ever read the comments on youtube, why are people so much more horrible on the internet than they are in person?

People who would never dream of using racial slurs or sexist language on the metro are perfectly happy using it on youtube or on other anonymous posting services.

We think that people are encouraged to self censor when they use their own name.

Why?

Your reputation and your standing in the community is tied to your language, is tied to do with you treat other people.

But if the community, so called community, is made up of anonymous posters, then you have nothing to lose by being an absolutely atrocious human being.

You can say anything you want and do anything you want and get away with it, and no one will think that you're being inappropriate, and no one will judge you for that behavior.

So ultimately if people's real name were tied to their post, we think it's much more likely that they would behave civilly.

And we see that this happens in person.

People are generally much more affable and pleasant in person than they are online.

This could be because of the reputation or also because when other posters have a photo of themselves have their real name you're more likely to remember that there are people too and that they deserve your respect.

Just like when you interact with another human being, you aren't just polite to them because you don't want to look like a jerk, but also because you care about them as another human being.

We think that tying into this empathy and also to this shame would ultimately reduce the amount of hate speech, reduce the amount of racism, reduce the amount of awfulness on the internet in general, that this would make the internet a more accessible place for people of different backgrounds and that ultimately this would also be enough to justify requiring people to post with their name rather than anonymously.

Our final argument might seem a bit perverse at first, but it's about preventing doxing doxing is when an otherwise anonymous community publishes the name and real world information about an individual in that community.

Presumably the reason there's a threat here, is because there's an imbalance now.

One person is a known quantity the other people remain anonymous.

If everyone were a known quantity then there wouldn't be any benefit to doxing people.

We think that this would prevent hate groups from using this as a tool to intimidate people and prevent them from speaking on line, which is something that we see groups like anonymous do right now.

For all of these reasons we believe therefore that you should ban anonymous posts.

Thank you.

"james_2486_electoral-college_con_opening_rachel","2486","CON","james","rachel","The united states should not abolish the electoral college.

We think that the current system as it exists in the status quo ought to be continued in the future for two reasons.

The first is that the american democracy is very robust and successful already and that if something isn't broken we ought not change it.

The united states has had more peaceful transitions of power than any other democratic country in the world as far as I'm aware.

We've had one civil war, to be sure, but ultimately, over the last two hundred and some odd years, the country has proven very robust using the existing system for electing the president.

At that point, we don't think that the system should be changed, especially when many other countries which use a popular vote system have had fewer transitions of power peacefully or have been much more prone to civil conflict due to their electoral systems.

So at the point where the united states has proven able to select a president who is broadly palatable to most of the american people, using the electoral college, it seems foolish to abolish it.

Rachel points out many flaws in the system such as that it isn't perfectly allocated according to popular will, but we think that, actually, the electoral college does a really good job of balancing popular will with regional representation.

On the one hand, states are allocated seats primarily according to their population.

You get two votes automatically in the electoral college, and any subsequent votes are based on population.

So california has over fifty votes because so many people live there.

What this means is that ultimately, we balance the interests of small and populous states.

Now you might say who cares about these small states like wyoming, as rachel does.

But ultimately, the united states is a federal republic, and that means that we have to consider the wishes of every member of the federation because they're all equal states, and legally speaking, the united states' sovereignty is derived from the collective sovereignty of all of the fifty states.

So we can't just ignore some of them, like wyoming, even if they have very small populations.

Now, rachel's correct that wyoming has a smaller population than most large american cities, but that doesn't change the fact that it has equal sovereignty with california, which has sixty times more people.

So that's a facet of our legal system, but because the current system has produced so much stability and prosperity and is still generally democratic, we don't think it ought be abandoned.

You're throwing out the baby with the bath water if you get rid of the electoral college.

And this leads nicely into my next point which is that the replacement system would not be better.

I don't know why rachel thinks that the american government would come up with a fair and representative system to replace the electoral college.

Remember that this is a country where almost every representative is elected from gerrymandered districts which are deliberately drawn to negate the ability of people to actually control who their representative is.

So at the point where our lawmakers are elected by gerrymandered districts and have a vested interest in preventing the american people from having a lot of control over elections, there's no reason to assume that they wouldn't come up with some ridiculous and unfair method of selecting the president.

Perhaps they would have the president be elected by the house of representatives and the senate rather like how prime ministers are selected in countries like france.

But this would just transfer power farther away from the people and make gerrymandering effective at the presidency as well as in other respects.

Or perhaps they would come up with some system whereby it was based entirely on popular will, and people from most of the country would have no input at all.

Perhaps they would come up with a system that made it even easier to prevent minorities from voting and having their vote counted.

It's difficult to argue the alternative would be better given that the people who would be designing the alternative are corrupt and don't have the best interest of the american people at heart.

So for all these reasons, we should not abolish the electoral college.

Thank you.

"
"tim_2486_electoral-college_con_opening_james","2486","CON","tim","james","We should not abolish the US electoral college.

So, while people may be with an uproar given that the two of the last five presidential elections resulted in a result in which the popular vote winner did not win the electoral college and therefore, did not become president of the united states, we think that it's important to take a step back and recognize that there's no correct way for the US democracy to function.

Majoritarianism isn't necessarily the best way for the government to to function, for the best way for people to make decisions and in fact, majoritarianism has historically been a way in which marginalized groups have been oppressed, in which tons of violence and state violence has occurred against marginalized groups, and we think that there is no correct way for the democratic system to work.

And there's no system that's going to be entirely democratic, because it's always necessarily going to be the case that some voices are marginalized and some voices are ignored.

We think you need to do is the united states government is present an option in which the country, as a whole, is as represented by the election results as as possible.

We think the popular vote leads to leads to control simply by urban areas, at the expense of rural areas.

We think that what you would end up seeing is an a a presidential election in which candidates only spend their time in urban areas, they only spend their time in cities, and people in rural areas are never going to be able to have their voices heard.

We think that that's simply not fair.

We think that all american individuals should be valued equally by the president.

We think that is the only government official that exist to represent the government or the the country as a whole.

We think that that person should be forced to recognize the the issues of rural and urban, of coastal states and of internal states of all of these groups, and we think that the US electoral college best does or best insures that that's the case.

So, we have a few reasons why we think the electoral college is good.

The first is that it corrects for a lack of big state control of the senate by giving more weight to those big states.

What this means is that the electoral college insures that big states are given a greater weight even though in the senate, those states are given the same weight as everyone else.

So it's a balancing factor.

It's a system of the checks and balances that were created internally to the US government.

It'll it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way that they otherwise don't in the senate, which means that in the highest office, those states are balanced out by the fact that in the senate, they don't get as much of a voice as many think they should.

Furthermore, it allows for swing states to get to put issues on the table that otherwise never would've been able to.

So we think that, for example, ohio, in an election which only the popular votes matter, is not going to be a state that gets very much attention, but every four years, it gets a ton of attention through the US electoral college because it's a swing state.

What this means is that these interior rust belt states, these states, such as ohio and indiana and virginia, states that otherwise wouldn't get a lot of attention because they don't have big urban centers, get attention, and it ensures that those issues get to the national stage.

It means that people that are otherwise largely ignored by the political elite get their voices heard, and we think that's crucial, especially in a time where political elitism is running at a higher level than ever.

Finally, we think it insures transregional appeal of the president.

As I said, the presidential office is the only office in US government that is elected by the whole country.

What this means is that that person needs to have appeals, not just to california and new york and the urban elites that live in those coastal areas, but to all people.

The the president of the united states is the president of new york and the president of iowa and the president of montana and as such, even if they don't win the electoral college in every single state, you're more likely to result with a president that has a transregional appeal than you otherwise would if you simply allowed for the popular vote, to ensure that seventy percent of californians and seventy percent of new yorkers end up deciding who's going to be president of the united states.

That's not fair to those inside of the country, that's not fair to the vast majority of americans and for this reason, we should not abolish the US electoral college.

"
"james_2486_electoral-college_pro_opening","2486","PRO","james","","We should abolish the US electoral college.

So for those who don't know, the american president is not elected by the american people.

Instead, the american people vote for representatives to go from their state to a group called the electoral college, who then select the president amongst themselves.

We have a few reasons why we think this practice should be abolished and replaced with a nationwide popular vote.

First, we tell you that the electoral college is fundamentally undemocratic.

Why is this so?

The way that seats are allocated in the electoral college is that every state gets one seat according to the number of representatives and senators they have.

This is a problem because every state gets two senators, and because the smaller states are still guaranteed at least one representative.

What that means is that each electoral college person in california represents hundreds of thousands of people whereas in wyoming, they likely only represent a couple tens of thousands of people.

Some people's votes count as much as five or six times more than other people's votes, and we think that this is fundamentally antithetical to the idea of liberal democracy.

We think that people in california deserve the same representation by the president as people in wyoming.

And recognize that because of the way the system is set up, people don't even campaign in many of the most populous states, like new york, texas and california.

Ultimately, they ignore those voters to instead focus on people who are disproportionately powerful because of the electoral college, like voters in iowa and ohio.

So those people have a huge amount of say and control over the president's policies and the future of the country relative to the vast majority of people, who live in safe states like california, that will always go to one particular party.

Our second argument is that we think the electoral college causes unnecessary conflict and degradation of democracy in the united states.

If you'll recall, in the two thousand election, george bush and al gore sued each other and ultimately, the new president was selected by the supreme court rather than any elected body.

The reason why this is so was that the electoral college is vague and its proceedings don't make any sense.

States allocate their electors according to a winner-takes-all principle, which means that a difference of two hundred votes in florida, which is a rounding error in a state of twenty million people, ultimately decided the presidential election.

At that point, it's up to courts to recount votes if they're challenged by the candidates and ultimately, you lead to months-long, very expensive recount processes that wouldn't need to take place in the event of a popular vote, because no president has ever won the national popular vote by two hundred votes, but that often happens in given states.

But not only does it create conflict in that sense, it also creates conflict in the sense that many people living in larger states are resentful and are more willing to back politicians in other sectors, such as the senate and house of representatives, who will represent their interests at the expense of the nation, because they don't feel represented by the president.

So we think this undermines cooperation and also the perception of fairness in american democracy, and that this is very likely one reason why the US has chronically low voter turnout.

The final reason we should abolish the electoral college, and this seems so obvious that I'm shocked that such intelligent men as james madison let the system go into effect, is that it allows for ties.

Right now, if the electoral college is tied, then the senate, I believe, breaks the vote, not important who, someone in the legislature.

But why would you have a system for choosing the president that allows for ties?

You don't allow even numbers of people on corporate boards, you don't have an even number of judges on things like american idol.

It just seems tremendously foolish to allow such an ineffective metric for choosing the president.

And the other team may say that ties are unlikely, but they're certainly not impossible, especially given that some states always vote in a particular direction.

We think that this shortcoming alone should be enough reason to get rid of the electoral college.

For these reasons, it should be abolished.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_2486_electoral-college_pro_opening","2486","PRO","rachel","","The motion for today's debate is the united states should abolish the electoral college.

Two main areas of clash: the first on the true representation of people and what it means to be a democracy.

We tell you that at it's core, a democracy is about providing equal representation to all people living underneath that system.

Obviously the system isn't perfect.

It is impossible to get every single person living within the united states into one room to come to a consensus on policy decisions.

This is why we have systems that elect our representatives to make those decisions on our behalf.

But this doesn't change the fact that those representatives ought be as representative as possible and actually represent the people who are voting them in.

Just as we recognize that it is bad when those with more money are able to lobby their way into more policy we also tell you that is antithetical to democracy to give people more votes based on their location.

At the point that it is the fifth time that the electoral college didn't match up to that of the popular vote and someone was elected who wasn't truly chosen by by the people through the majority.

It is time to institute a system where the leader is truly chosen by the people.

More than this, we tell you that the old pragmatic arguments for the electoral college no longer exist.

Current technology allows us to make it for votes to be counted effectively with very low risk of fraud.

Which means that currently it is completely possible for us to have a more direct election of our presidents.

More than this, we don't we think the winner takes all policy destroys individual voices and leads to the kind of apathy that we regret in the current status quo.

I am unlikely to vote, unlikely to care about the presidential election outcome, because I live in a in a state where the vote is already decided because my state always votes blue.

What this means is that even if I am a hardcore republican, I'm unlikely to show up to the polls because I know that my vote will not be represented in regards to what president actually gets chosen.

Secondary of clash has to do with what we think this affects societally.

We tell you that the system in which every single state gets two representatives in addition to their population based electoral college vote undervalue cities and allows rural areas with lower populations, such as states like wyoming, to have every individual person's vote worth more than other people surrounding them.

We tell you this is a problem on two levels.

First, it's probably bad if just because I live in wyoming, my vote matters four times more than someone living in new york.

But more than just the principal reasoning as to why this is bad, it's also problematic because wyoming is almost eighty five percent made up of white people, whereas the majority of people of lower classes, the majority of people of color are living in much more urban areas, in cities such as new york, portland and philadelphia.

The problem is that the electoral college system systematically undervalues the votes people of color and minorities insofar as it places more votes on those who are living in less populated areas, traditionally that are less populated as well by people of color.

More than this, we tell you that the way that this changes campaigning means that instead of advocating for all states and all people equally, what happens is that individual political parties will choose to advocate only to swing states because they know they are the only ones truly making decisions about the election in regards to the electoral college.

It means you pander your not only do you only campaign in those areas but you also pander your policies to specific blocks that get you those states.

For example, getting in any given election where florida is a swing state, it is much more likely that candidates will pander to the floridian elderly in order to try and get the electoral college state rather than looking at rising demographics of young liberals living in highly populated cities.

But more than this, the next step to this is that if you are a president who's trying to go for a second term, there are certain stances you cannot take even they might if even if they might be politically preferable because you're afraid that you won't get elected for the next term because of swing states.

For example, few presidential candidates are likely to actually like actually repair our relations with cuba because they are afraid of losing floridian cubans and thus the floridian vote.

For these reasons proud to propose.

"
"will_2488_un-veto_con_opening_james","2488","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition of today's motion, that we should abolish the pee five veto power on the security council.

Two independent points of analysis, first, that the veto power assures stability in the security council, and on the UN at large, and secondly, that it increases the incentive for clientelism, when you get rid of the veto power.

But first, I want to make a note on the framework.

I think it's important to recognize, that when gov says: oh well, there's this issue with membership, that some of these people are outdated, and then they provide you with structural reasons why it's hard to move this membership around.

I think it's important to recognize, that that's probably not true, that you can create voting procedures for eliminating or adding members of the like with veto power, much in the same way that we change the membership of the security council, on a fairly regular basis.

These are things that change over time, and I think we already have mechanisms, that we apply to other aspects of the UN, that solve for those systemic changes pretty well.

So, I don't think we would have much difficulty in adjusting for these shifts.

So, under the first argument, that there is better stability in a world with a veto power.

It's important to recognize, that it ensures that nothing passes, that would initiate major conflict within the UN.

What I mean by this is that, for example, a resolution against russia wouldn't do very much to actually solve for this type of thing, right?

Like the US media, and like western media at large, often reports pretty extensively on things that russia does, that are bad, it's not like nobody knew about the invasion of ukraine.

The problem is that when you formalize these things through the UN, the most significant impact is just irritating russia, and situations that are pretty tense, it can absolutely spark rage.

I think a good example of this is actually what gov brings up: about resolutions against israel, in favor of palestine.

Those types of resolutions are very likely to enrage the united states, in such a way that could actually lead to conflict in the region.

I think even if it's not an all out war, even muscle flexing usually results in deaths, because of brinkmanship and border conflicts, and things like that.

So, it's key to continued membership as well, because nations are likely to leave the UN, if they don't think it works to their advantage.

This was talked about extensively in the lead up to the iraq war, back in two thousand and four.

So, I think it's worth recognizing then, that the veto power is one of the only things actually ensuring the stability, and continuity, of the united nations.

So, if you think that the UN does literally anything that is beneficial to the global structure, it's important to keep the veto in place.

Our second independent argument is that it increases incentives for clientelism, on their side of the house.

Why is this true?

So in the status quo, if the US doesn't like something that's coming up to the plate, they can just veto it and it's not an issue anymore.

On their side of the house though, this actually has to go through, what is referred to as, or what is nominally a democratic process.

But the problem is that the US actually has a decent amount of states, that will just do whatever they tell them to do.

Israel is obviously the go to example of this, but there are lots and lots of other states that, if the US was to just enact even a small amount of leverage against them, they would just bow to pressure.

This is true of pretty much all the hegemones that are on the security council, china has this power over a lot of members, as does russia.

So what happens then, when you can't just veto things you don't like, is there's an arms race to rack up as many clients as you can, to bully as many smaller nations into voting your way.

That results in a lot of harms, that usually means threat of sanctions from both sides.

So, you have to choose who's going to hurt you less.

It's worth recognizing then, that if their concern, on side government, is ensuring that smaller nations have a say within the global infrastructure, and have the ability to avoid punishment from larger nations for stepping out of line, the way to do that isn't incentivizing larger nations to just bully them whenever they want something to be killed, or something to pass.

Given that, I think it's really important to sustain the mechanism, that allows these large hegemons to get their way without like knocking down the smaller nations along the way.

Proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_2488_un-veto_con_opening_tim","2488","CON","rachel","tim","When tim says pretty things, like listing all of the different despots he thinks the UN should take action against, he forgets that were operating in the real world, and that these kinds of ideas, such as mass, like regulation of different kinds of dictators require consistent backing, and the promise of a positive end results, because in the end, we've seen what happens when intervention occurs, and you don'tt stick it out till the end.

We tell you that power vacuums, such as that which were created in iraq, are more untenable than the dictators who existed previously, and as such, any active intervention should be one that is carefully planned, plotted, and known to be successful.

We just don't think this is something that the security council of the UN can actively provide, or promise, and this is why we think that the veto is very important.

Because, just like tim, sometimes individual countries get carried away, and think that they can stomach and chew more than they actually can.

When this happens, we think that the five main members are good at pinpointing when these funds don't exist, when the political motives don't exist, and saying: take a step back, maybe these call outs aren't necessary.

Two many areas of clash, the first on why we think the purpose of the security council, and the UN at large, is about staying a treaty and discourse based group, and allowing these nations to come together and have discourse.

We think that in order to maintain a dogma of discourse, you need to have an unwillingness to enter violent conflict, because otherwise, you're no longer discussing the conflicts that you're entering into, rather you are just saying: this is a bad situation, we can send forces in to fix it.

But more than this, we think it is good to think thoroughly through these kinds of proposals, because multiple vetos mean that these proposals go back on the floor, and reenter discussion, and we think that the sixth version of a given proposal is always going to be better than the first version.

And the only thing they're doing, on their side of the house, is making it easier for less thought out plans to go through.

More than this though, we think that you increase politicking on the UN, when you take away power, from those who see it as necessary, to them.

We think that all that happens is that, none of these five national security nations are going to be willing to give up their effective veto, and so are going to exercise it to the manipulation of countries.

We think that, it's just much more likely that now, they're going to go to swing votes, or go to individual leaders of countries, and say that if you want our support in other matters, if you want us to not undermine you, in other global trade agreements, or global affairs, you are not going to vote yes on this.

We think this creates more tension, and also leads to the pitting of countries one against the other.

At the point that the US can blame any country that defers to china's opinion for not letting their proposal through, those countries are more likely to get targeted, meaning that this kind of tension is antithetical, more so than anything else, to the UN's purpose.

Our second area of clash has to do with why these countries have earned their right to veto, and why, if we take it away, the impacts are much worse.

We think that, even if it makes it harder to regulate these larger countries, it is true that these larger countries, individually, provide more money to the UN than any of the smaller countries.

What this means is that, they are effectively buying their ability to choose where that money goes, and if they do not believe that a conflict is worth it, then they ought not be obligated to send their money, and their troops, to that conflict.

But more than this, we think that the alternative, on their side of the house, is that these countries just leave.

Because, in the end, large superpowers have very little to gain from the united nations.

They already have strong economies, they don't need collaboration that as much as other nations need collaboration with them.

What this means is that, when they start feeling disrespected, they leave, and the countries that are left don't get any kind of don't aren't able to get anything done, because they just don't have the same kind of funds, and don't have the kind of organization.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"james_2488_un-veto_pro_opening","2488","PRO","james","","We should abolish the united nations security council veto power.

So right now five countries, who were very powerful at the end of world war two, the US, russia, china, britain and france, are able to veto any business of the security council.

The rotating members of the council, countries like india and germany, do not have the ability to use this veto.

So we're going to argue that the security council would be better off without veto power.

Three arguments: first, we think that the members who have been granted this power are outdated.

In particular, britain and france are not the world powers that they were in nineteen forty five.

Britain no longer controls india, france no longer has a massive empire in africa and southeast asia.

At this point, britain and france are just two medium sized countries that aren't actually that important internationally.

Except as EU members.

We think that there are many other more deserving countries, notably india and japan, who are not represented on the security council in this way.

So right now two countries that really don't matter to international relations, because they're part of nato so they're under the US umbrella, have a disproportionate influence on international law and decision making.

We think that this is unjust, that those countries don't have the power to deserve this or the population to deserve this, so they ought not be given this power.

So the other team might try to tell you that, oh we should just transfer the power to india or japan.

But that just passes the ball down the road.

Because what happens when in the future of those countries are no longer as significant?

What if russia suddenly, for instance, stops being a superpower?

We think that ultimately it's always going to be very difficult to change the security council vetoes to appropriately reflect new developments in international relations and that it would simply be better not to have the policy at all rather than to try to reform it.

Secondly, we would argue, that the veto power is undemocratic.

Right now you could have a hundred and ninety five countries all vote in favor of something, but if one of the big five countries decides that they don't want it to happen, then the policy couldn't be implemented.

We've seen this with many resolutions on palestine that have tried to force israel to recognize the palestinians' right to the west bank and things like that.

The united states vetoes them and it doesn't matter if a hundred and fifty other countries voted in support.

Since part of the purpose of the UN is to promote international cooperation, it seems that it flies in the face of that goal to let one country dictate to every other country what UN policy can or cannot be.

Even if that country is as powerful as the united states.

We think the UN should try to make the security council more democratic and that removing the veto is the most obvious way to do so and that it would allow smaller countries to have more influence on regional issues that affect them directly rather than having superpowers dictate policy to them.

Our third argument and final one, is that this prevent solutions to serious problems.

For instance, during the russian invasion of ukraine nothing was done to actually prevent the violence from spreading because russia was able to veto anything on the security council.

Indeed the US and britain didn't even bother bringing resolutions about the problem because they knew russia would veto it.

Emergencies of the sort that the UN was created to solve are not able to be resolved in the united nations because of the veto.

The other side might say, look we were able to intervene in korea during the korean war, but that was only possible because the soviet union at that time was protesting the UN for not admitting, I think ukraine, and so they weren't voting.

But in general, because one major power will always have it in their interest to support international aggression, since in practice they back all of the countries that do this, we think it's very unlikely that you'll ever be able to really solve a problem using the UN security council as long as the veto exists.

So for these reasons we should abolish the UN security council veto.

Thank you.

"
"tim_2488_un-veto_pro_opening","2488","PRO","tim","","We should abolish the united nations security council veto power.

So in the status quo, the united nations has five members of the security council that are permanent and have veto power.

The rest of the members alternate on I believe yearly basis, but they they rotate amongst people or member states of the UN, aside from the united states, russia, great britain, china and france.

These are the four nations that have veto power on the UN security council.

We think that we should take away that veto power from those nations and instead, should institute a system in which two thirds two thirds vote by the security council would allow for action to be taken, military action or intervention to be taken by the security council.

This would also allow them to send cases to the ICC.

In the status quo, again, this needs to get past a get get past a veto, which we don't think should be the case anymore.

So, why do we think that this is necessary?

We think that the security council is entirely marred by inactivity and inaction in the status quo, and the reason for that is that political interests, specifically from china, russia and the united states, prevent action in these instances, because they have vested interests in maintaining their sphere of influence and control over specific reasons regions.

For example, syria is something that simply cannot be acted on by the united nations because russia has vested oil interests and other types of interests in the assad regime.

Also in the case of places like north korea, china refuses to allow the united nations to intervene.

They would never allow some sort of referenda to pass the security council, and we think that this goes against the purpose of the UN.

The UN is meant is meant to foster global cooperation between powers both large and small.

We think there's there's that there's a long history of of imperial oppression, and the UN existed to try and solve for that, to ensure that there was some sort of equalizing of the playing field in international relations.

The UN places power disproportionately through the security council in imperial interests, which means that in the instances in which these major superpowers in the world align in their interests and choose to go after small nations, these are oftentimes nations that are the least protected and already the ones that are most harmed by former imperial interaction.

We also think that if you ever want to be able to go after powerful states to enforce the regulations on things like human rights and other things that the UN exists to foster, things like protecting geneva convention rights and protecting innate human rights through referenda and treaties that exist between states, we think the only way you can ever get that type of protection, especially on large states like china or russia, is to remove the veto power that they currently have.

We think that in practice, this has been a horrible system that protects despots like those in syria and north korea.

It protects superpowers that systemically abuse human rights, whether it's individuals that are gay in russia or individuals who are minority and black in the united states.

We think that no action can ever be taken against these superpowers by an international body, by the body that is supposed to regulate these human rights abuses, that is the UN, if these countries maintain their veto power.

We think force would be more likely in those situations.

Even in those instances where a few interests contradict, we think that even if you're not going to be able to go out against the united states or china anytime soon, it's still preferable to have UN resolutions that ensure that the violence that is currently being done in places like north korea and syria, instances in which lives are daily on the line, we think that these are instances in which the UN has an obligation to act, and the current system doesn't allow for that possibility.

And for these reasons, we should abolish the united nations security council veto power.

"yaar_2502_drinking-age_con_opening_daniel","2502","CON","yaar","daniel","We actually agree with the previous speaker that eighteen-year-olds are perfectly able to drink responsibly, but he himself does a fantastic job of explaining how the legal age limit is not really the de facto age in which you start drinking.

We are well aware that eighteen and nineteen and twenty-year-olds drink alcohol left and right, and we're fine with that.

But the problem in lowering the drinking age, the legal drinking age, to eighteen or to sixteen is that it subsequently will lead to the lowering of the de facto age that kids start drinking to like fourteen or fifteen, and that's already something that side government would also agree that is un like preferable.

So here's what we say, basically: the legal definition of who is a minor and who is an adult will forever be random.

Whether we set it at twenty one or eighteen or sixteen, it is clear and obvious that it won't really apply equally to everyone.

Of course, there are sixteen-year-olds that are very mature and calculated and trustworthy, and there are twenty-two and twenty-three-year-olds that are very immature and reckless.

Therefore, it doesn't matter where we draw the line, it is going to be, at the same time, overinclusive and underinclusive, but we still have to draw the line somewhere.

So, we're willing to accept the position of side government that most eighteen-year-olds are responsible and mature enough in order for us to be fine with having them drink, but we but we think that they will also concede that most fourteen-year-olds are absolutely not responsible enough.

What we also must take into consideration, when we draw the line, are the effects that daniel explains so so like so nicely of how, you know, the taboo when something is forbidden makes me want it more and so on.

So, this means we need to acknowledge the fact that no matter where we draw the line, this means that like in the vicinity of that limit, people will not abide by it.

For this reason, we had a very good reason to take this extra buffer zone and to set the legal drinking age to twenty-one.

This comes out of the understanding that most eighteen and nineteen-year-olds will still be drinking and that's fine, but far less fourteen-year-olds will be will be drinking because it will seem so much remote to them.

Note that all of the harms that the previous speaker lists in regard to like reckless responses like irresponsible drinking that results from not being of the legal age will simply apply tomorrow to fourteen-year-olds, and that's much worse.

So, we see the same type of logic in other places in the law, by the way.

For example, when setting speed limits to like roads and highways, it's perfectly obvious to the government that most people will exceed the like the limit and the speed that that's allowed in a in like a few percent.

But in most cases, like the police will even turn a blind eye to mild violations.

Yet, these limitations are set in a manner that is relatively conservative, like just in order to make sure that whoever violates them still doesn't drive too fast.

We call this the anchoring effect.

This the number that we set is being used as a sort of a metaphorical anchor that people don't stray too far from.

So, we say that it's it's perfectly like reasonable what the other side are saying, that the current drinking age is a bit unfair to eighteen-year-olds but as they tell us themselves, like eighteen-year-olds don't really suffer too much out of this.

They drink anyway.

So if we lower the drinking age, we say that the damages are going to be much more significant.

So, oppose the motion.

"
"will_2502_drinking-age_con_opening_james","2502","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should lower the drinking age.

Three independent points, the first of which is that the specific standard the government sets, the age of majority, is bad.

And the reason for this is at the age of majority, the rights afforded to you, like voting and things like that and driving and what not, often lead to particular forms of development and maturity itself.

That is, that the age of majority isn't often not designed in such a way that it is like by eighteen, you will be mature enough to do a lot of these things.

It is designed in such a way that affording you these privileges will get you to become a more mature person by exposing you to new things in life.

There are also things that you want to have done before the age of majority to prepare you for things like voting, but the point is that the age of maturity itself develops the individual.

This is important then because we think that drinking is something that is a particularly important decision, not just in terms of the way that it can affect your life, but also in terms of the fact that you need significant amounts of information about it before you can really participate in informed consent.

What we mean by informed consent is that an individual has to be aware of the consequences of a particular action before we really begin to respect their right to consent into that action.

A lot of government's case circles around consent, but the problem with this is that if an individual isn't old enough to understand the consequences the action, it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action or autonomy by any means.

Our second independent point is that people will always drink before the drinking age.

Gov makes a lot of noise over the fact that people tend to abuse the drinking age and drink before it's legal.

The problem is that the reason people do that is because drinking is seen as more or less a status symbol, something that people do to be rebellious or as a cultural thing.

For example, in france, where the drinking age is much lower, people start drinking at an even younger age.

So if you can start drinking at like sixteen, then you just start actually doing it at fourteen.

The problem with this is twofold: one, the information inbalance that I discussed earlier scales out to an even greater extent the younger you go.

So, if you let people drink at eighteen, at, yeah, at eighteen, and then they start drinking actually at like fifteen or sixteen, then those information the lack of ability to access meaningful information on the practice is even greater.

But secondly, there become significant health impacts at such a young age that, in addition to problems with binge drinking, there are just demonstrated pediatric studies that show that brain development is significantly damaged by drinking at a young age.

Given that then, it's reasonable for us to put limits that ensure that the goal post is significantly higher.

That is, if we tell people you can drink at twenty-one and they start drinking at eighteen instead, that is significantly preferable.

Our third and final independent point is parental rights.

So, we believe that especially at a young age, like in your teenage years, children, again, don't have access to the necessary information to make informed decisions on everything that they do.

Given that, we afford a lot of latitude to parents in being essentially the proxies for their best interest, because parents do have access to that information.

They've lived longer lives and understand more about the world.

So with drinking particularly then, we think that children are uninformed in the consequences of this action and as such, it is reasonable to proxy off the decision about whether or not they can engage in drinking to a parent.

The problem is so, obviously, like a lot of the time, particularly in the united states, there is a culture of parents, if they are okay with it, just allowing their kids to have drinks before it's legal, and usually this isn't cracked down on.

But, if you would lower the drinking age to such a rate that it's just legal for children to do of their own volition, parents can't make that decision for them and as such, you lose the ability to proxy out that decision to someone that's more informed.

We think that at this age, the parent is the past proxy because of the lack of information the child has and as such, we should ensure that parents have the latitude to make this decision, not children.

Proud to oppose.

"
"daniel_2502_drinking-age_pro_opening","2502","PRO","daniel","","We should lower the drinking age.

We should lower it everywhere and we should probably lower it to sixteen, maybe eighteen, definitely below twenty one, and the reason that we should do this is twofold: first and foremost, on a practicality level, as far as sensible regulation of act of drinking, and secondarily as far as rights are concerned.

So let's start by talking about responsible usage.

I think the first and most important thing to note is that the drinking age is the biggest joke in the entire world and as somebody who is now just who is now twenty one but has nevertheless been drinking for many years now, I think that if you ask just about any person in most countries, certainly in america, they tell you that there's a variety of ways in which an underage person can get alcohol and that the drinking age is entirely unenforced.

You can get it from an older friend, you can get it from a lot of parents who don't care because when they were in high school the drinking age was eighteen, you can get it from with a fake ID.

Years a whole, there's like an endless flow of ways in which alcohol is just accessible to people.

So, given that we operate in a world in which alcohol is going to be accessible to minors and that this isn't going to change because of deeply ingrained social structures that make alcohol a part of our culture, the focus shouldn't be can we get people underage to stop drinking, the focus should be how can we make sure that people who are underage drink responsibly.

So I think that the first thing that you want to do is not make people be afraid to call the police or be afraid to call an emergency or like the EMT's if somebody for example drinks too much, or if somebody is possibly getting like sick from drinking too much.

And I think that this is a real problem in a lot of like parties and things like that where because there's a real fear of consequences, there's a real fear of getting in trouble, people don't wanna tell the authorities when things got out of hand.

So you're less likely, first and foremost, to see partying happen in a responsible way and you're less likely see drinking happen in a responsible way secondarily, when you're not allowed to drink legally you're more likely going to do this in less safe places.

The drinking is more likely going to happen in the basement of a fraternity or the basement of like or like or in a high school party, than at a bar or somewhere where it's like public and a lot more able to be regulated.

So I think that that's another thing that's incredibly important.

But I think it additionally when you have a drinking age, it creates more of an an allure or more of a taboo or more of a glorification around drinking that makes us that people are more likely to over do it, so that people are more likely to use it as an act of rebellion and that people are more likely to essentially drink as like a symbol of independence.

A a symbol of having fun in your youth.

And I think this is very clearly something that we see right now and it's a big reason why like for example risks of binge drinking or over using too much alcohol are much more prevalent and places in america than they are in more some european countries where it's much more normalized and there's not the same kind of allure.

But the final thing that I wanna talk about is right.

Because I think that the idea that if your eighteen, or even if you're younger, you're an independent person with autonomy, with agency, with dignity and worth, who can make decisions about their life.

Who can decide whether or not it's good or bad for them to have a shot of alcohol, who can decide whether or not it's good for bad for them to have a glass of wine at night.

I think this is an incredibly basic decision that the average the average teenager is entirely capable of making.

It's not like you're buying a car or something like that, where you're spending tens of thousands of dollars, or in something that's going to affect you for years on end.

We're talking about things that are only going to affect you for one night, that aren't ultimately that big of a deal and are perfectly reasonable decisions for people to make.

We let people buy like sandwiches.

I don't see why alcohol is all that much why it's all that different.

Just because something affects your brain does not mean that you shouldn't be able to like use it as long as you can use it responsibly.

And the assumption that young people cannot do something responsibly is obscenely ageist to the many responsible young people, and to the many people who simply do not fit into these stereotypes.

So for all those reasons we should lower the drinking age.

"
"james_2502_drinking-age_pro_opening","2502","PRO","james","","We should lower the drinking age.

So we're going to argue that in jurisdictions where the drinking age is higher than the age of majority, it should be lowered to the age of majority.

So, in america, it should be lowered from twenty-one to eighteen, in ontario, it should be lowered from nineteen to eighteen, and so on.

Three arguments for our side today.

First: we think that the law needs to be principally consistent in order to be legitimate.

Right now in the US, in ontario, in other regions around the world, you can vote as soon as you reach the age of majority.

You can serve in the military, sometimes against your will, you can get a job, you can buy a car or a house, but you can't buy a beer.

We think that ultimately you undermine the effectiveness of the law, when it appears arbitrary in people's eyes.

If people think that the law is arbitrary, they're more likely to disrespect it.

If they think that the law is fair and just, then they're more likely to respect it.

So right now, when people can't buy a beer but they can buy a shotgun in america, we think that people think the law's absurd, and this tells them that the law is not something that they need to respect in a very high way.

So we think that ultimately, because of the high prevalence of underage drinking which is impossible to prevent, you undermine respect for the law, in general, and create a culture where people try to avoid the law and get out of doing things that are legal that is extremely widespread.

Probably, a large majority of american and canadian teenagers drink long before they reach the age when they're permitted to.

If the law were principally consistent, we think more people would have respect for the law and you wouldn't have that culture.

So ultimately, we should lower the drinking age for that reason.

If someone can buy a gun.

We say let them buy a beer.

Our second argument is about personal freedom.

Realize that the people we're discussing in this debate are all adults.

We trust them to make other decisions on their own well-being, for instance, what kind of healthcare they want to have, what education they want to pursue.

They're past the age at which the state is making decisions for them, like making them go to high school.

We think that, with this in mind, it's important that we defer to individual freedom for a few reasons.

One: drinking doesn't really harm anyone else.

It's a personal decision.

Remember that drunk driving is illegal either way.

At that point, we think that governments, in general, should defer to letting people make their own decisions if no one else is at risk.

The reason this is true is that people know their own interests better than anyone else knows their interest.

There's a poverty of information that you and I have about any third person.

They know facts about their own life that we don't have access to.

They know about their own experiences in a way that we never will.

With that in mind, we should defer to letting these individuals make their own decisions about whether alcohol consumption is right for them.

And I think it's quite likely that if you gave people this freedom and respect, that things like binge drinking culture would actually decrease, because people would be empowered to make responsible decisions rather than encouraged to make irresponsible ones, like drinking too much or drinking illegally.

Our third argument today is that we are opposed to public morality, in general.

The main case for making it more difficult for young people to buy alcohol is that certain parts of the population think it's immoral to drink alcohol or to drink alcohol in excess.

We think, again, that individuals should be free to make their own decisions.

If certain christians in america and canada don't want to drink alcohol in excess or don't want to drink at all or don't want to drink until they're older, those people should have every right and freedom to do so, but they shouldn't be able to impose their will on people of other religions, who don't have these particular beliefs.

We think that, in effect, higher drinking ages are a form of morality that's imposed on the general public and that this is not the role of the state.

Ultimately, the government should protect people from each other.

It should uphold the law, but the law that it implements should recognize individuals' own autonomy and not apply one form of viewing the world or one way of life onto everyone.

For these reasons, we should lower the drinking age.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_2526_double-jeopardy_con_opening_daniel","2526","CON","rachel","daniel","The biggest problem that gov has in this debate is that danny misunderstands what double jeopardy actually is.

What the legal definition connotes is that it is the same crime, with the same evidence, that a person is retried for.

What this means is that his entire first independent point that talks about what happens when the new evidence appears, when someone confesses, all of this falls through because with the addition of new evidence, with the addition of a confession, the crime can be appealed and the case can be reopened.

We think at the point that there are significant systems in place that allow for the appeals process, will allow for for people to come out and confess to their crimes, even after they have pled non-guilty and won, means that double jeopardy exists as a protection for innocence against the overreach of the judicial system.

We think that when it is most used is when is in attempts to layer punishments or wear someone who's innocent down, and that is what we are talking about in this debate.

We think that everything that danny talked about is completely irrelevant at the point that you can always appeal the situation when new evidence comes out.

Two main areas of clash: the first on the justice system and why we think preserving the finality of rulings is important.

We think that the purpose of the justice system and trial by jury is to evaluate guilt and innocence based on the people, based on how your peers see you.

What this means is that whether you are guilty or innocent isn't just a fact claim, but also depends on things like your situation and where you were at the time and small amounts of biases with how people perceive them.

For example, something that might be perceived as first-degree murder by some individuals can also be spun to look like something like self-defense for others.

This is why we think that it's important that when we stand by a standard of trial by your peers, you stand by it to the end.

You don't just get to switch out the peers at the end and try the trial over and over again until you get what you want as your result.

Rather, the first time is important unless something changes, because this is the standard our legal system has set.

We also think this protects against things like court clog and providing closure.

We think at the point that you could just retry every trial as many times as you want until you got a guilty verdict, you'd never stop retrying people.

Danny says, "" oh, but we wouldn't want to do this "", but I think he misunderstands the incentives of the judicial system, elected judges, people who work for the DA's office.

They want convictions, and they want and they they oftentimes go to many ends to get them.

We think that people who have money and have been victimized by others are often willing to spend that money trying and retrying trials because they want closure.

All of these kinds of things are all reasons as to why you would go on and retry people and keep them in jail.

But more than this, we think that providing closure for victims, as well as perpetrators, is incredibly important.

We think that after that hearing that your trial is being retried all over again is an extra level of emotional suffering that someone just shouldn't have to go through more than once.

We think that when someone hears the guilty or not guilty verdict, this should be the end insofar as anything after that is just additional suffering and additional pain.

This works both for the victim, insofar as now they have to listen and go through reliving that reliving their damaged experiences over and over, but also for the person who was accused, insofar as they're if they are innocent, they also have to live through this again.

Second, though, we want to talk about protection of the innocents, because we think it's most important to keep those who are innocent out of jail insofar as imprisoning someone who's innocent is a rights violation on the part of the state, and it's always worse than not imprisoning someone who is not innocent, insofar as they have already committed their crime and no future rights violations are going to occur.

We think that allowing the court to have systems that let them retry innocents over and over again in order to wear them down, because the DA is so convinced that they are guilty that they will do anything regardless of the evidence, is a problem, because a lot of the time the DA or large corporations just have more money, and in order to stop being dragged into that courtroom, I will agree into anything.

We also think that allowing courts to layer punishments is also a problem insofar as you can try someone for the same crime over and over again and give them more and more years in jail.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_2526_double-jeopardy_con_opening_rachel","2526","CON","yaar","rachel","Obviously the legal system isn't perfect and is incapable of always delivering justice purely.

It will never be able to do that.

That doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and maximize the justice in pursuit of truth, but we have to understand that there is a very dangerous tradeoff here: that the more power, the more absolute power we grant the state in pursuing truth and justice, the more chances of creating greater injustice.

This is why the system is built in such a way that limits the power of the government and the state out of the understanding that this asymmetry in powers can create a distortion and allow people in positions of power to do almost everything they wish.

This is why we don't allow evidence that were unlawfully obtained to be submitted in the court, even if they might help us reveal the truth.

This is also why we limit the ability of the state to put its citizens in double jeopardy.

And yes, this means that in some cases we will not be able to catch bad guys, but that's simply worth the risk.

We need to say, though, that there are very few cases, in reality, of guilty defendants that are able to beat the system and get fully acquitted.

Everyone can cite the names of OJ simpson or bill cosby, but it's exactly because these are such rare instances that they became so famous.

How do I know this?

Because the national conviction rate in criminal felonies is above ninety percent, well above it.

This means that it's incredibly rare, next to impossible, to avoid conviction once charges have been pressed against you.

No matter how good your lawyer is, chances are against the defendant.

Do we really think that ninety something percent of defendants are guilty people?

I doubt that.

Given this, it is really unclear to me what is this so pressing problem that side government sees in the status quo that would require such a drastic amendment to one of the core tenets of the constitution and would require granting more power to the already too powerful public prosecution.

We hear that it does more harm to allow guilty men walk around free than to judge and try innocent men twice.

We disagree.

We disagree, both because we really don't accept this assumption that if you are truly innocent, then it's likely that you'll be found so a second time because as rachel says, the system is flawed.

It's far from being perfect in pursuing truth.

So, in the second time or third time or fourth time, at some point, people break.

They no longer have the time or the money or the strength to keep on fighting for their innocence, and the state will always have much more stamina and resources to continue fighting.

So, once the state sets its aim on convicting someone, they can simply never rest until they manage to do so.

We also, though, we like regardless of whether you're innocent or not, we we still disagree with this claim.

We think that it's truly morally unjust when a criminal walks around free if he was never caught and put on trial.

But given that we have caught this man, and we have tried him and we were simply unable to convict him for whatever reason, then the system did all that it could.

It doesn't mean that it's good that he now walks around in the street but this is not also not a violation of rights, as rachel would have you believe.

Meanwhile, we say that putting people through the entire process of a criminal trial, where your name and your reputation are smeared, your career is over, your family life, your social life gets hurt badly, you were forced to spend a fortune and after winning, you would have to face all of this again, in our opinion this is a grave injustice, and this is amoral, you know what, even if you are guilty.

And then rachel says that people will start losing trust in the system and will start breaking laws when they see that the system is unable to catch and lock up the bad guys.

So the first answer here is this is the classic example of a slippery slope.

We would love to hear one example in which chaos and crime hit the streets due to double jeopardy.

People don't abandon so quickly the concept of the rule of law and just take matters in their own hands.

I know that this is an argument that we sometimes like to say in debateland, but it's simply untrue.

The system is deeply ingrained in our consciousness.

Most people cannot imagine a world without a country or the courts or the rule of law.

Second answer here is that if anything can create a public panic is to see that the criminal system harasses people who were already found innocent once and retries them over and over.

People can say to themselves, "" jesus, this man's life is ruined now, and it could have just as easily been me. ""

If anything, that's the kind of thing that could turn people much more wary and suspicious towards the authorities.

So for all of these reasons, we are very proud to oppose.

"
"daniel_2526_double-jeopardy_pro_opening","2526","PRO","daniel","","We should abolish the double jeopardy defense because it is affirmatively justified to ultimately achieve the purposes of justice, and secondarily, double jeopardy is unnecessary because abuses of it will be self regulating in nature given practical constraints.

So let's start by talking about why double jeopardy is affirmatively justified.

So keep in mind that the likely reason somebody is going to be having this debate and discussion in the first place of trying somebody for a crime that they were already not convicted of, is because they probably have to have some reason to do so.

We would posit that the likely reason for this is because some kind of new evidence comes up that would possibly lead to an actual substantive change in the outcome of the case itself.

So this new evidence can come in the form of say like maybe like more modern day DNA evidence, it could come in the form of a confession, or come in the form of like new witnesses that maybe were too afraid to testify beforehand.

There is any number of circumstances that are fairly plausible under which there might be different evidence that could that was concealed before the trial that could substantively change an outcome.

And this is particularly true given that in a lot of places like america, there is a right to a speedy trial.

Especially when it's a criminal trial.

Oftentimes there's not a very wide time window for a lot of evidence to come out or it could just be something that came from long time ago where some of the evidence may not have existed because of contemporary technology.

So this is important because it under any one of those cases it's possible the outcome of the court can change.

And this is key.

Because I don't think that guilt or innocence is merely something that is proven or not proven by a process.

That is to say if you actually committed a crime in reality, just because you were found not guilty of it doesn't mean that you didn't are any less guilty of the crime, if you did in reality do it, because whether or not you committed the crime is is factual in nature.

Not nearly procedural in nature.

So this is important because I think that the criminal justice system should, at its best, try to make sure that it is striving for truth and that it is striving to make sure that it's actually able to punish people who have committed crimes and wrongs.

Keep in mind that if these people, if there's more evidence that somebody committed the crime, maybe they there was like a confession or DNA evidence, and they're now walking away scot-free from that crime, this is someone who deserves to be punished, who isn't being punished.

This is someone who in which case victims have been wronged and victims aren't being compensated.

This is somebody who may be a threat to society at large and society isn't being protected from this person.

There's a lot of reasons why if somebody has is guilty and is a criminal they need to make sure that they're justice is administered to them.

So finally let's talk about why I think that at the end the day this is self regulating and isn't actually going to be abused all that much.

Keep in mind that it costs a whole lot of money to put on trials.

Whether if you're a if you're like a state, you don't want to just like this is why a lot of trials are settled with plea agreements or settlements or things like that.

People don't want to go to trial because going to trial is risky, it's expensive and it's a arduous process.

So I think that when you're giving somebody the option of trying someone again for a crime they were already not found they were found not guilty of it's likely that most rational people will look at this as a waste of money.

So they're probably not just going to do this to harass people as a way to keep people in jail indefinitely or try to indefinitely detain somebody without actually proving charges against them.

I would first and foremost likely say that if these abuses were occurring, they would be found unconstitutional and therefore they would get kicked out.

But I also think that this is just an unlikely thing actually happen in reality.

So what you're left with is double jeopardy only being used when there's actually a substantively likely change in the outcome of the case one way or another.

So for those reasons very proud to propose.

"
"rachel_2526_double-jeopardy_pro_opening","2526","PRO","rachel","","The motion for today's debate is that we should abolish double jeopardy.

Two main areas of clash, the first on the nature of our system of justice.

We think that a crime doesn't change, just because time has passed.

If I murdered someone fifty years ago, they are still murdered now, and the law remains the same, and the victim was still harmed, and the person is still dead.

We think that at the point, that new evidence comes out, maybe the jury was stacked, and we have reason to believe that there was an unfair acquittal, maybe there was a confession, or even the hundreds of years of new technology that we have acquired allows us to do things like DNA testing, and blood testing.

We think that the justice system needs to represent a need to adjust, to maintain what the original spirit is.

We think we have to acknowledge, that sometimes the trial system is imperfect, and the only way to solve this is by allowing something like double jeopardy to solve for these situations.

Because currently, the problem is that people, after getting acquitted once, and just setting up the right system of circumstances, hiring an expensive enough lawyer, any of these kinds of things.

Like, silencing enough witnesses means they get away scot free.

We think it is always a larger rights violation, to let someone go free than to put someone who is innocent through the trial process twice, because, in the end, if you are innocent, you are likely to be found so twice.

But, if you are guilty, you get to go free all forever after you're after you're tried once, under double jeopardy.

We think the impact of this is that, if if our justice system cannot be trusted, or is inconsistent, or allows people who are guilty to go free, due to things like the lack of double jeopardy, we think people are okay with flaunting the law, and losing trust in the system.

Things like OJ simpson getting away without any punishment, and then writing the book, if I did it, describing the crime and being like: yeah, I totally did it, are exactly the problem with our current society.

Criminals are okay with afterwards basically yelling to the world: look at the crime that I've committed, because they know they cannot answer it.

We think this decreases the general public's trust in the system, and decreases the efficiency overall.

Our secondary of clash has to do with victims' rights.

Because we think that when we're evaluating the justice system, we're working in a system of rights violations, and trying to compromise on who gets to be justified where.

And we think, the most important person in these situations is often the victim, because if someone has perpetrated something against a victim, they have violated their rights, and now owes a debt to them, and we because of what has been taken to them.

We think that a violation we have we think that it is important to be certain that that , that you are that the person, who you're letting go, is truly innocent, in order to fulfill your obligation to the victim and their rights.

We think, more than this though, that it is unlikely to be a system that is abused.

We think oftentimes resources are limited, and retrying the same person, over and over, is not only taxing to all those involved, but also incredibly monetarily consuming, and we just don't think that state legislatures have that ability.

Like, even if someone is incredibly racist, if they don't have the funds to amplify that racism, they're not going to retry the same person seventy million times.

More than this, we don't think that victims are going to push for this either.

At the point that someone has been found innocent once or twice, either they run out of money, or they ran out of the energy to do so.

We think it is important to recognize that, if a victim once closure, a second acquittal will oftentimes be enough.

But the problem, with allowing someone to not have to enter that second process in the first place, is that you are lacking the potentiality of closure at all.

We always think that the larger rights violation is on the side of having double jeopardy, we think that the only people who it protects are those who are guilty, and therefore it ought be abolished.

For these reasons proud to propose.

"
"james_2559_nato_con_opening_yaar","2559","CON","james","yaar","We should not disband nato.

We think that it's important to keep in mind that the comparative in this round is a world with a strong alliance of democratic states who use their military and influence to promote democracy around the world, versus a world in which all of these countries act independently without common policy.

We don't think that nations like the united states or britain would just stop interacting with the rest of the world using their militaries because there were no nato.

We think that they would do it in a worse way.

So two big arguments.

The first is why we think nato promotes cooperation, and ultimately this is a good thing.

Recognize that many of nato's member states like germany and britain used to be enemies but now are allies.

After world war two the united states, probably the best thing we've ever done as a country, forged this alliance out of the countries that used to plunge the world into war time and time again.

The story of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is constant conflict in europe, which is largely ended because under american leadership nato has created this alliance that forces all western european countries to work together.

This has prevented massive amounts of conflict we think since world war two.

But on top of that we think nato is good because it aligns american interest with those of other countries.

So recognize that america's natural position in the world is perhaps isolationist.

America is far away from most other countries, and in many cases our interests are more commercial rather than interventionist around the world.

But when the united states was uninvolved in the rest of the world other countries were much more powerful relative to their neighbors.

We think that countries like russia and china would be much more powerful on the international sphere without american involvement.

We think that it's preferable to have the united states as a very powerful democratic country, take an active role in the world.

As an american I'm going to be the first to admit that US action in countries like vietnam and iraq has been regrettable, but we think that checking russia and russian and chinese aggression around the world is still a good thing, and that there's no other country that would be able to do this the way the US can, and that nato is uniquely what draws the US into having an interest in protecting other countries democracies, and spreading democracy around the world.

We also think that the US is less likely to act unilaterally because of nato.

Now the other team might say look you invaded iraq using your coalition of the willing not nato, but if you look at your members it's effectively the same group of countries.

The comparative in this debate isn't that america will completely stop fighting other countries, it's that we would do it without allies.

If you think that the US abuses its power and now, it seems that it would be much worse if the US weren't beholden to any group of allies like they are through nato.

But aside from that we think that even non-members can benefit from nato action.

The other team tells you that nato's interventions have largely been a failure, but if you look at yugoslavia in the nineteen nineties, we think that the nato intervention ended the civil war much more quickly than any local power could have because the US and britain were more powerful than the countries actually fighting, but on top of that we think that even though the accounts of genocide in the nineties were overblown, now that we have the information we do now, it's critical that when there were charges of genocide, the US and britain and other countries went in to try to prevent that.

We think that ultimately the world is a better place.

If you have a group of countries that are willing to go to war to prevent a genocide.

So therefore we think that nato interventions can actually be a good thing and protect people.

Now the other team might say you haven't gone into stoplights of other genocides, but look the comparative is that they did intervene in yugoslavia where as no one else might have without nato.

Aside from that we think that ultimately the big impact of all of these points is that nato creates peace.

There's an old saying if you want peace prepare for war.

By having the world's democracies work together to create strong militaries and a strong alliance network that makes any of them even the smaller countries like netherlands or norway too powerful to attack, we think that ultimately there's less likely to be conflict.

So the second big point we think in this debate is that nato checks undemocratic nations.

Yes nato threatens putin's russia, but we think this is a good thing.

If you think that right now putin despite the existence of an alliance of powerful democratic nations has still attacked georgia, has still attacked ukraine.

We think that it's likely that he would have also attacked the baltics if it weren't for nato.

We think that if anything the problem with nato is that it hasn't expanded east quickly enough.

And you may say the US and britain do bad things, but at the end of the day, we still think that it's better to live in countries influenced by the US and britain than countries influenced by putin's russia in terms of quality of life and freedom for the people who live there.

And aside from that we think that nato is the main way in which democratic countries cooperate.

So if you want a powerful check on undemocratic nations around the world like russia, like certain middle eastern dictatorships, like china, nato is the only game in town.

Nato is the only group of democratic countries that have shown that they are willing to intervene to protect democracy around the world, and while it may be unfortunate that lots of people have been harmed by their interventions, we still think that a world where democracy is powerfully protected is better than a world where they block this champion.

So for these reasons we should not disband nato.

"
"will_2559_nato_con_opening_james","2559","CON","will","james","I'm proud to oppose the motion that we should disband nato.

Our first independent point is that it provides a check against russia.

So specifically we think that this is important because the like the way that russia acts in the you know modern geo-political system is intensely aggressive.

Even if the USSR has collapsed and as you know ceased to exist, there is still a lot of belligerence coming from that part of the world that is necessary to beat back.

I think you know the recent annexation of crimea is certainly a key example of this but even just sort of like broader aggression towards like other neighbors, like meddling in georgia's elections for example, has demonstrated that russia is you know a particularly problematic actor.

This then in turn means that there is an active need to provide a check against that russian aggression.

That if you assume that this is like a actually dangerous actor on an international scale and that they are complicit in significant human rights abuses, sovereignty infringements within the region, there's an active need to create a unified front against it.

Gov takes issue with the fact that nato is probably overkill, we specifically think that nato being overkill is its greatest attribute.

That is that the best way to ensure that russia doesn't act even more aggressively is to actively deter it from acting aggressively.

So if you essentially just tell them, look we've got the fire power and the unified front to just beat you into the ground if you try anything really egregious, we think that that then means that russia is unlikely to try any extremely significant human rights abuses or sovereignty infringements or anything like that.

Our second independent point is that nato forces unity in military action amongst western nations.

So we think that this is really important because the alternative to nato is a world in which you kind of have like a bunch of loose cannons on the international system, particularly the US which is known for its aggression and its interventionist foreign policy, is like really important to keep in check.

Nato ensures that there's a voting bloc of countries that have to come together and make decisions.

Sort of like the two heads are better than one type philosophy.

So we think then that when there are lots of individual countries making these decisions together, it's more likely that these are going to be cool, level headed, well thought out discussions rather than just tainted by some countries like personal nationalist bias or whatever.

But beyond this, we think that there's importance to the unity in action because it ensures that there's consistency across country lines.

We think one of the worst ways to deal with an international crisis is an inconsistent response, that is different countries respond differently.

Because then we think that aggressors can essentially play these countries off of one another.

Think of, for example, the inconsistent responses to I don't know hitler's early aggression in world war two.

This is a prime example of when the geopolitical response was poor and this enabled the aggressor to get away away with a lot of like territory grabbing and other aggressive moves that normally should not have occurred.

As such then, we think that a unified front ensures that there will be a consistent, clear response that will mitigate the likelihood of something like this happening.

Our third point is that, contrary to the assertions of side government, nato is a fairly equitable organization.

I think it's interesting that like gov tells you, oh this system's really unfair to the united states because no one else is paying enough, then also it's really unfair to everyone else because the united states is like the only place that actually benefits from this system.

Like obviously one of these just justifies the other.

Then if only the united states benefits from this then it's just like totally reasonable for the united states to pay a lot more money into the system than the other states.

At that point then I think this system is pretty good at tracking the comparative value that these countries get out of the actual organization.

Proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_2559_nato_pro_opening","2559","PRO","yaar","","We should disband nato.

Along the sixty or so years of its existence, nato has turned from being the neighborhood watch to being the neighborhood bully.

Its actual interventions have turned out to be failures one by one, and its very existence, an ever looming presence, pose a serious threat to the stability and safety of the global community.

First argument.

How nato threatens russia and why it's a bad idea.

Nato was originally created with the sole purpose of intimidating the soviet union from trying to expand westward, and of course they created in return the warsaw alliance, and so throughout the cold war we had this mutual deterrence on both sides that was quite effective in preventing escalations.

But with the collapse of the USSR, the warsaw alliance was disband and so it was seen reasonable to assume that nato should also follow.

But in reality what happened is not only did nato not disband itself, but rather it expanded eastward, allowing for the united states to place soldiers and missiles right across the border from russia.

This understandably is being seen as a provocation by russia.

Why is that so bad?

Because vladimir putin's russia doesn't respond well to such threats.

There is little doubt today that russia isn't happy with a unipolar global system in which the USA has all the control, and it wants to reassert its position as an international power.

Perhaps that much is true with with nato or without it, but instead of intimidating the russians and have them quietly fold back, nato has served as a thorn in the side of russian pride, and it became a key catalyst or an excuse for russia to take all the more actions in the region.

Among its actions we can see the war against georgia, the intervention in the ukrainian crisis and annexation of crimea, and the intervention in the syrian civil war.

Nato feeds into the nationalist sentiment that fuels these aggressions, and had it not been for the western provocation of nato expanding eastward, it is unlikely that russia would have dared to take all these aggressive steps.

But nato provides putin with the local support he needs inside russia, and is a winning card with the international community as well.

This is why instead of being a protective stabilizing tool, nato has become a destabilizing force that brings more harm than good.

Second argument, why the interventionist approach has failed us.

So, nato isn't only seen as a body that reacts to attacks on its member states, like it originally was, but also serves as a form of interventionist force, as we can see from its involvement in the invasion of iraq and bombardment of libya.

It seems that whenever the west tries to intervene militarily, it only creates further chaos that leads to an even worse situation than before.

This is true to both the examples that I've mentioned earlier, and of course any other thing that pops to mind.

In addition, we simply don't see why american or french or norwegian soldiers should be should be sent off and fighting and dying for some remote county in georgia.

We believe that it's time to learn from the mistakes of our past and stop trying to see america and the west as the knights in bright shining armor that comes to save the day.

For all of these reasons, we believe that nato should be disband.

"
"james_2559_nato_pro_opening","2559","PRO","james","","We should disband nato.

So, the north atlantic treaty organization is a military alliance between a group of global north countries like the US, britain,france, canada, and other countries in europe.

We want to disband it for three reasons.

The first, is that it has served its purpose.

Nato was created to protect europe from the soviet union.

Which obviously isn't around today and doesn't pose a risk anymore.

We see that nato was probably very necessary at a time when you had thousands of soviet tanks in east germany, germany was a divided country, there was a lot of concern about war, the americans and the russians both wanted to put nuclear weapons in europe and that needed be moderated in some way.

At that time, there was an urgent need for the countries of the global north, these first world countries, to work together to protect each other from communism, and to structure their alliance in such a way that all of the countries could participate in it on some sort of equal footing.

But at the point where nato was created in reaction to the soviet threat and the soviet union has been gone since before I was born, it really seems like the alliance has run its course.

Our second point is that we think nato was unnecessarily threatening to russia.

So remember that nato was founded explicitly to be anti soviet, and that russia has taken on most of the responsibilities and duties of the soviet union in the international sphere.

So what you have now is a country that's much weaker than the soviet union, russia has nothing approaching that kind of military power or influence, but which faces the exact same military alliance.

It's almost as though you have an eight hundred pound gorilla in the form of nato, and instead of having another gorilla in the form of the warsaw pact and the soviet union, you just have a guy going up against it.

We think that the russians with good reason feel threatened by the presence of american nuclear weapons only a couple hundred miles from their border, by the presence of thousands and thousands of american troops in germany, ultimately it's very clear that nato members use russaphobic language as a unifying factor and they drill and practice for attacks against russia and defending against russian attacks and otherwise basically the alliance puts russian leaders in a position where one, they can sell the threat of nato invasion or the threat of nato attacks, to maintain their own power and undermine democracy in their country.

And two, where they have very legitimate concerns about the kind of weapons that are being deployed around their borders.

It's probably true that most of the fears that people like vladimir putin claim to have are just a way to get support from the public, but there is some legitimate concern about having an enemy alliance on your doorstep with nuclear weapons that exist solely to contain your country's interests.

This threat to russia's only bad for world peace and we think that getting rid of nato would do a lot to restore goodwill between russia and europe.

Our third argument is that nato was an unfair alliance.

This is for a couple reasons.

On a financial level, almost no countries in nato actually pay as much as they're supposed to into the common defense.

We see that the united states picks up the vast majority of the tab while most european countries basically have no military.

They're free riding on the back of this alliance and getting away with not defending themselves making the american taxpayer pay for it.

We think it's unfair that americans have to pay to defend swedes and other people who aren't doing their fair share.

But on top of that, we think nato is also unfair in the other direction, because the US has such outsized control on it.

Although nato is nominally an alliance of equals, in practice the US dictates what nato is going to do, drags nato members into conflicts and proxy wars, and ultimately is able to use it I to almost keep the europeans as satellite states, sort of analogous to the old warsaw pact in eastern europe.

And it seems true that the countries with the most independence are those with the largest militaries like britain or france, while smaller countries with weaker militaries have less independence.

So we think that at the end of the day, nato was an unfair alliance to both the wealthier members who pay more than their fair share, and to the smaller members who were suffer the dictates of the united states.

So for these reasons, because it's served its purpose, because it undermines peace with russia, and because it's an unfair alliance, we should disband nato.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_3162_multiculturalism_con_opening_james","3162","CON","rachel","james","We don't think that rejecting multiculturalism means rejecting all cultural differences between individuals.

Rather, we think that rejecting multiculturalism has to do with the way that we approach the macro expression of culture within a country.

So it's the difference between saying that this country does not have a single culture but rather is made up of multiple groups and multiple different cultures, versus saying that even though we might have people who are from different countries who have different cultural expressions, we as the united states, or we as australia or any country have one main culture that we identify as that ties us all together.

We think that you're always going to have people who are like culturally diverse.

It's about what you look at on the macro scale when we talk about multiculturalism or not.

With that, two main areas of clash.

The first on decreasing violence within your culture.

Because clashes and tensions are going to exist between cultures on both sides of the house, but it is worse when those groups are kept distinct and are told that they are different, are told to revel in that differentness and maintain that culture, rather than feeling like they have to assimilate.

Because rather than feeling like they are part of a greater whole, part of that country first, these groups instead feel alienated from other cultures and this creates more rise in tensions because there is no over arching identity that binds them together, but also makes it easier for a more dominant culture to destroy subcultures or force them into sub par living conditions.

Because there's less there's less pressure to assimilate less pressure to be accepting when your country is when your country feels that that there is no like main identity and rather multiple different ones.

So we think like in situations where you have small minority groups living in largely, it like within the middle of a larger like majority group, in the situations of multiculturalism and acceptance of multiculturalism you're going to have much more tension between them because you don't actually have something that binds them together beyond just being individuals.

So, we think that individual tensions grow when there is no mainstream culture to connect them.

So, my russian jewish family is much more likely to be hostile towards the like polish christians across the hallway because we aren't actually feeling like we are all americans, but are rather identifying each other by our ethnicities and by the harms that our ethnicities might have done to each other.

So like "" those pol's killed a lot of jews during the holocaust. ""

Are second area of clash has to do with creating a strong national identity and its importance.

Because what drew misunderstands is that a melting pot means bringing in parts of other people's cultures into the mainstream and celebrating those components.

Because it's always going to be impossible to celebrate every single culture in its entirety, so what we allow is for the mainstream and for the majority groups to experience minority culture and to bring it into the limelight while individual culture still exist.

So on the comparative, we think that dividing people by ethnicity means they choose their ethnic group above their own nation.

So I'm going to be a russian or a jew or a, I don't know, israeli before I'm going to be an american, even though I currently live or have citizenship in america.

We think this is both bad economically, because a lot of the time people make decisions off of what corporations to support based on the ethnicity rather than on the country.

So my dad will buy an israeli product before he buys an american one, just because he feel solidarity there.

But it's also bad for the service like that we pay to our own countries.

Right?

So a lot of the time, if you're encouraging multi culturalism, you're going to lose a lot of people who are returning to what they call the homeland, and so you lose their productivity.

Or a really good example is when american jews go and serve in the israeli military rather than the american ones.

We think this is something you have to accept when you're promoting multiculturalism.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"james_3162_multiculturalism_con_opening_will","3162","CON","james","will","We should not adopt multiculturalism.

So I want to be very clear what this debate is about.

When we say don't adopt multiculturalism, we mean that people should assimilate into society rather than integrate.

So here's the difference: when people assimilate, they give up many aspects of their pre-immigration culture in order to take on aspects of the dominant culture in their new country.

A good example of this would be people moving from eastern europe to the united states in the early twentieth century.

If you came from the russian empire to america in nineteen hundred, you most likely gave up your original language, your religion was probably normalized to certain american customs, we see that many orthodox churches in america are very different than orthodox churches in the former soviet union, for instance.

And it's quite likely that you adopted many parts of the american national identity, things like baseball and other american ideas in place of your traditional games and views.

So we think that that's preferable to a world like the one will describes in which people keep their religion and keep their customs.

Will says that he wants to avoid problems like ghettoization, but we think that even if you have russian or italian or irish neighborhoods in american cities, at the end of the day after, one or two generations, everyone is so americanized that it's really just a legacy thing and not something that affects people day to day.

So with that in mind, we have two big arguments.

The first is about national unity.

We think that one reason why the united states was able to mobilize millions of people of different backgrounds for the two world wars was because of its policy of assimilation rather than integration.

In other words, the united states didn't adopt very much from russian culture when russians were coming over here in the early twentieth century in large numbers.

Instead, we encouraged immigrants to adopt elements of american culture.

But the result is that our country was stronger in times of war because we were able to know that everyone shared certain core beliefs and core values as an american and that there were certain commonalities across different groups within america because people had assimilated so much to american culture.

So you could have army units where you had, you know, african american, russian american, irish american soldiers with an anglo-american officer or shift around any combination of those, and it wouldn't be a problem because everyone ultimately was an american rather than a member of the groups that they were part of before they came to this country.

We think that ultimately this may increase the strength of the nation in times of war, and therefore it is desirable.

But our second argument is that we think, in the long term, we get better treatment for minorities, and I'd like to compare a couple of different examples from around the world.

When people move from muslim countries to the united states today, maybe they keep their religion, but ultimately they speak english as their primary day-to-day language most often, they send their children to secular american schools, oftentimes their daughters don't cover their heads, they adopt more american customs in terms of dress, and people basically americanize to a very high degree.

Compare this to a country like france, where what you have instead is people who move to france from countries like algeria, and I'm not putting blame on these people, oftentimes it's for colonial reasons that they're moving their that are outside of their control, but they move to these countries and they maintain their original language in their communities.

They often don't integrate into the french way of life, and sometimes that's because the country doesn't allow them to do so.

Will touched on this when he talked about nation states.

But we think that it would be preferable to have people assimilate in a more american fashion, rather than try and fail to integrate, because what will talks about, things like celebrating diversity, ultimately looks an awful lot like people remaining different.

We think that in the long term becoming more like the same is likely to get you better treatment than remaining different and that if you see how groups like italians and jews are treated much better now in america than they were a hundred years ago, I think you have a clear road map for how this can happen.

So for all these reasons, we should not adopt multiculturalism.

Thank you.

"
"james_3162_multiculturalism_pro_opening","3162","PRO","james","","We should adopt multiculturalism.

So by that we mean that we think that the practice of having multiple cultures exist alongside each other in a pluralistic fashion in a country, is preferable to trying to seek to integrate everybody into one monolithic culture.

So we think that basically the comparison here is between the idea of a melting pot, where everyone blends together into one culture, and a salad, where all of the distinct components remain recognizable.

Three arguments: first, we thinks it ultimately multiculturalism leads to more immigrants coming to your country which makes your country more competitive economically.

We see, for instance, that people are more likely to immigrate to countries which are more tolerant.

This is why places like canada actually have a higher rate of immigration than the united states.

We think that when people feel that they can go to a new country and be more accepted for their culture, and not have to worry about integrating into the dominant culture, that they're more likely to choose to move to that country.

You know, imagine that you're a sikh doctor in india and you want to move to the west.

Would you choose to go to a country where you're going to have to give up your religion and your traditional practices in order to fit in, or a country where you can continue any of those practices that are important to you, or that you like, and you'll still be accepted?

We think it's obvious that you would pick the second one given the choice.

At that point we think that you're more likely to bring in immigrants and highly qualified workers from other countries.

Why is this such a boon?

One reason why countries like canada, the US and australia are so much wealthier than the rest of the world is that they have brain gain and other countries have brain drain.

Many of the best and brightest in countries like india or pakistan choose to leave those countries and come to the US, canada, australia.

We think that this makes the countries that receive these immigrants more competitive, because they have you know better doctors, better engineers, better professors, at the expense of every other country.

So all countries should seek to have this big draw factor for immigrants in order to increase their own economic competition on a global scale.

Or competitiveness I should say.

Our second argument is about promoting tolerance.

We think that when there is a norm that everyone has to assimilate to your culture when they moved to your country, that this makes it easier for people to be intolerant.

If they see someone who's a little bit different, or who's sticking out, then they think that person needs to change to become more like me.

That's the melting pot model.

But when people experience multiculturalism, we think it's more likely that they're willing to accept others for who they are, to tolerate small differences and to try to learn to empathize with other people.

A huge driver of racism and religious discrimination and things like that is the empathy gap between people of different backgrounds.

But we think that if you live with the idea that it's okay for people to be different, then it's easier to bridge that empathy gap, versus if you live in a country where it's not acceptable for people to be outside of the mainstream culture.

Our third and final argument is that we think that a better national culture emerges as a result of multiculturalism.

Because recognize that if you have one culture that everyone has to assimilate to then ultimately you're going to have a harmful norms internalized into that mainstream culture.

People who immigrated in previous waves of immigration are likely to look down on current immigrants for instance.

We see this in america.

Many people who are third generation americans look down on people who are first generation americans even though their grandparents or great grandparents work from this country, and that's because they think: "" look, we italians or germans or whoever integrated.

Why can't people from latin america do it in the same way? ""

We think that when you have multiculturalism you end up with a national culture that's more focused on tolerance and accepting others, that's more willing to adopt things that are good from the immigrant cultures, and more willing to engage in self criticism about what is bad in the existing culture.

So for these reasons we should adopt multiculturalism.

Thank you.

"
"will_3162_multiculturalism_pro_opening","3162","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt multiculturalism.

So two points really, but first just like a little quick model explanation I guess is that what we mean by adopting multiculturalism is really embracing a society where multiple cultural backgrounds coexist.

So this is something less like a nation-state and more like you know countries where there is you know a wide variety of cultures represented.

We're obviously not going to that they're you know represented equally but we do want to embrace a society that attempts to integrate rather than segregate essentially.

So two independent points.

The first being that you know that integration basically leads to more contact amongst cultures and increases tolerance for others.

So we think that in a world without multiculturalism, that is one where there is sort of segregation based on cultural values and norms, where you know sort of like different groups and enclaves have different physical territories and that they don't really intermingle very much.

There's a lot of intrinsic harms generally for the ones that for whatever culture is in the minority.

The first is just outright discrimination you know talking about housing policies, talking about you know education policies that you just have like active discrimination against this group because they don't have the political capital and numbers to really represent themselves properly within the system.

Second is violence.

You know just just outright violence against members of an oppressed community.

This is I think a good example of this islamophobia in the united states where people who just legitimately do not understand the culture that a lot of people of middle eastern descent come from translates into widespread violence and acts of hate outright hatred against these people and that largely stems from just a lack of understanding from a lack of co-mingling that that allows the worst stereotypes of the minority group to take root in the minds of the majority and becomes the character by which all all people of middle eastern descent are analyzed.

Lastly though is just segregation.

And we think that broadly speaking segregation you know sort of the separate but equal line of thinking doesn't actually play out.

What widely happens with segregation is a minority population is put into is put into a living situation that is deeply inadequate when compared to the one that the majority has.

A good example of this is that african-americans in the united states are largely relegated to impoverished, resource poor inner-city areas where they are deprived of educational and financial opportunities.

Oum this of course then leads to sort of cyclical poverty where it is difficult for people to escape these harms of their own merit and their own volition because they are starting at a position that is relatively worse than those of people who enjoy power and privilege.

Given that then we think that multiculturalism can help solve for this by making people much more comfortable with like sharing quarters with people that come from different backgrounds, that have different culture and by sharing those faces then you facilitate more upward mobility, you facilitate more thorough integration and you don't have this level of segregation where people are relegated off.

Second and just very quickly is that I think you get a better culture when you have multiculturalism.

A lot of the time cultures can become dominated by unchecked beliefs that without some sort of outside perspective often goes unchallenged.

I think a lot of the times when people talk about the worst elements of a specific culture like things pertaining to you know discrimination against women for example in more conservative cultures that's largely a product of a lack of interaction with other more modern and more accepting cultures.

So when you have this multicultural environment where there is that constant you know dialogue between cultures, I think you're quite likely then to take the best of both worlds and run with that.

Proud to propose.

"yaar_3163_asylum_con_opening_james","3163","CON","yaar","james","I think that the prime minister has been a little unfair or at the very least unclear enough in his definition of what we are debating here because his entire speech focuses on how we must like better make or sure better enforce that the people who are being granted asylums are standing up to the criteria of who actually deserves it and that you know ordinary immigrants aren't just taking advantage of this by falsely pretending to be worthy of asylums and we totally agree.

We don't have any interest in people being granted asylums without them actually deserving it.

The thing is that in today's reality with the ongoing civil war in syria, there truly is a significant rise in refugees that do stand up to the criterion and that do actually deserve it.

So I think that it is side government's burden in this debate to defend things like setting stricter quotas of exactly how many asylums are granted that are necessarily going to leave out certain refugees that do deserve it.

Not just to say that we need to better look out for fraudulent claims because this is just simply pretty obvious.

So it is in this light that we turn now to answer side government's claims.

First, they tell us that the government needs to first and foremost look out for its own citizens and the influx of unskilled labor is harmful for the economy and comes at the expense of the citizens.

So the first answer here is that we are just unsure that it truly is harmful for the economy.

Even if it is unskilled labor.

As long as we strive to make them fit in and help them find jobs they certainly might contribute to the economy just like any other form of unskilled foreign labor.

You know researchers looking into this question today are at the very least undecided if not even actually leaning in favor of it and we mustn't forget that america has been billed as a safe haven for immigrants and refugees that were fleeing harsh circumstances and it emerged as the free world's leading superpower.

Second answer here is that even if it is a burden to some degree, we think that we simply cannot just ignore the moral meaning of sealing the gates.

It's true that the country is obligated to the well being of its citizens but this is not an absolute principle.

Like totally that is to say it doesn't mean that we can justify complete indifference to the unbearable misery of other people just because this will create mild inconvenience to our citizens and the third answer is that we think that's the foreign policy of the west in general, in the united states specifically, has a hand in bringing upon the horrific situation in syria by refusing to intervene in time and by seceding the control over to russia that is backing assad.

The very least that we can do is not to meet these refugees fleeing there with a shrug and a cold shoulder.

The next thing that we hear is that people will take advantage and cheat.

Well there is there are always people that will take advantage of loopholes.

This is just a part of reality but again, we are totally in favor of taking whatever step is necessary to minimize this.

Lastly they tell us that if we won't limit the a silence now, then populist leaders will take care of getting rid of it altogether later and we think that this logic is basically just giving up to populism.

We think that if anything, it is the other way around.

If we start compromising on our principles now, it will be that much easier to get rid of them completely later.

Besides we think that populist leaders like trump don't really concern themselves with the facts and the correct data of just how much asylums are being granted today.

This is what makes them populist.

This means that no matter how much asylums that we're going to grant trump will always exaggerate and blow up the numbers in order to serve his own message.

So what side government is proposing makes very little difference.

Look we've already shut down the doors before to refugees like for instance jewish refugees escaping persecution and mass murder in europe.

That is one of the most shameful episodes in american history.

Let's not repeat the same policies now.

Oppose the motion.

"
"rachel_3163_asylum_con_opening_sam","3163","CON","rachel","sam","So we think it's probably fine when governments are unwilling to take in hardcore criminals who have actively like committed crimes like homicide or actively violent crimes, but we think the debate we're having is whether you should limit asylum asylum against those who have been discriminated against in their home countries and those who like face imminent threats.

Like obviously we don't care if you stolen something from a store or if you have a misdemeanor, it's more about whether or not you need to be safer need to get away from your current situation.

Two main areas of clash: the first on the obligations of western liberal democracies.

Although the state is an institution, it's also made up of individual people that have obligations to each other.

One of the obligations is to assist others when it comes at little to no cost to yourself.

This is because the circumstances that provide one person with a better life than another are random.

But also because in capitalist systems those who profit often do so by oppressing others.

So the people escaping political subjugation in china are often the same people that people in the US are profiting off of when we outsource our corporation to to china and encourage the exploitative government.

We also think that western liberal democracies are more specifically obligated to developing countries and their citizens because they often are partially responsible for their circumstances.

Like america literally created isis when they shipped off weapons to like rebel groups in iran, and the britons and the brits literally destroyed african independence by redrawing the borders and just kind of colonizing all over the place.

Same with india.

When states cause the problems of others, we think they have an obligation to assist with the consequences given that they caused them.

We think that taking in those affected by their actions is an effective way to do so, and like possibly one of the best ways in so far as you are saving lives without like with minimum expenditure on yourself.

Like we think a really important thing in this round is that states aren't actually harmed by taking in more immigrants.

Like sure, there are arguments about why it might be difficult for your welfare system but all of these things even out over time.

Like we had many studies that have shown that immigrants, when integrated, actually become very productive members of society, and give birth to children that become very productive members of society.

Our second area of clash has to do with the arbitrary nature of citizenship.

Because even if you think that obligations occur first to your citizens, we don't think that applies if the way by which people can be citizens is arbitrary and there is no like fixed standard by which we measure.

So both the standards that we currently use don't really make sense, right?

Because either the standard is that you were born in that state or the standard is that you're related by blood to someone else.

Neither of these things are something that like you as a fetus or you as an unborn child can actually control.

You're born within borders you didn't decide, that in many cases of like countries or continents such as africa or asia were drawn by other imperialist states.

You have limited mobility, it's like very difficult to just choose to live in a comfortable situation because you are often blocked by your own government and by your own means.

So if I don't have enough money I cannot escape.

But also because of immigration regulations such as what we're talking about right now.

You're often also born into a class that you can't get out of because of societal circumstances.

So at the point that literally none of these things are things that I can opt into or like things that I can even comprehend, it's just something that I am placed into when I am born, we don't think that there's actually meaningful fair standard by which we ascribe citizens and therefore it's impossible for states to have obligations to them first.

This honestly makes the government's policy quite discriminatory insofar as it says: "" based on this arbitrary factor that you were born within these drawn lines, then you get to have then you get to have access to like better goods and resources where as everyone who is arbitrarily outside of those lines, well, screw you. ""

We think that obligation exists not to citizens but to any human equally unless, you ought not limit amnesty.

For these reasons proud to oppose.

"
"sam_3163_asylum_pro_opening","3163","PRO","sam","","At a fundamental level the right of asylum is the right to impose.

Although we regret any repression that individuals face as a result of their government or institutions which are powerful within their state, we believe that governments have no obligation to actually provide individuals asylum.

As such, we should limit the right to asylum in all western liberal democracies.

Our model is simple: we believe that western liberal democracies should not allow criminals into the state.

This does not include political crimes, because anyone who is running from their state will likely be guilty of that, but includes violent crimes or even low misdemeanors.

We believe governments should retain the right to refuse these individuals.

Additionally, we believe that asylum seekers should only be brought into the state if they add to the economy or society in some meaningful way.

If a job is already massively overly saturated, immigrants should not be brought in, even if they have been persecuted by their state.

We have two arguments to support this motion: first, on the obligations of government.

The obligations of government are first and foremost to the people within the state.

Their legitimacy is derived from the people because the ancestors of these citizens, either created the state or allowed other individuals into the state who've been deemed appropriate.

Fundamentally all moral legitimacy, any legitimacy which would give the states the power to use violence to do taxation, or to create a military, is derived from the people within that state and not foreign powers.

Additionally, the power of the state is derived from the people.

The the state speaks in terms of money and in terms of military force.

Both of these are derived from the people in the form of taxation and the ability to create and control a military.

As such, a government has no obligations outside of the people within the state.

It is incredibly important to have this sort of vetting, to ensure the prosperity of the people within the state as well.

Recognize that criminals have high recidivism rates, particularly when they commit violent crimes, and individuals who do not have a job or can't get a job, because an over saturation the market occurs, are far more likely to turn to crime.

Additionally, when individuals take jobs from other individuals in a certain western liberal democracy, they're a lot more likely to push those people into crime, and harm the families and communities which create and control the state.

As such governments have to vet the individuals who come in through asylum, and must limit that right.

The second independent argument is that there are people who have waited, or are otherwise more deserving.

Recognize that in most western liberal democracies there's a huge waiting list for immigrants who have applied to get into the state and have simply waited.

Let us evaluate the desert claims between these two groups.

First, on political persecution verses immigrant harms.

If you take the united states as an example, a huge number of immigrants from mexico and south america are running from dire situations of poverty, or running from similar persecution, but have not been recognized by the united states.

Things like cartel violence is far less likely to get you the right to asylum than violence from the state.

So in the vast majority of situations these people have just as many claims to come into a western liberal democracy as individuals who want the the right to asylum.

However, the individuals on the like waiting list have waited a huge amount of time, they've spent they've got the system legally and have otherwise respected the rules and regulations of the people and as such have a greater desert claim to come into the state.

We would further say that no individual who seeks asylum has a right to a particular state and given the variety of states who will accept individuals, and even the non western liberal democracies which will except individuals, they have no, that the right to asylum can be limited legitimately to protect the people within a particular state.

Thank you.

"
"james_3163_asylum_pro_opening","3163","PRO","james","","We should limit the right to asylum.

So in this debate, we're not going to say that countries should stop offering asylum completely, but rather that they should be extremely discerning in who is granted asylum.

A few reasons why this should be the case.

First, there's a tremendous cost to society of having the right to asylum.

Most often, people who come to a country for asylum don't have the means to support themselves.

Instead, they rely on some form of public largesse to support themselves until they're established.

So at that point, you have people receiving benefits from the state who have never paid in in the form of taxes, and who are not currently producing anything for society.

While it's true that some of these people might be great thinkers or scientists, as we saw from people fleeing germany in the second world war, many others are likely to be unskilled people who are just the victims of circumstances in their home countries, such as many of the syrian refugees.

We think that in order for states to continue to provide for their own people, which must be their first and foremost concern, they need to limit the right to asylum.

Our second argument is that if you don't limit the right to asylum, then people will take advantage of it in ways that we don't intend.

Right now, it's very difficult for most people to immigrate to a country like the united states, while it's relatively easy to gain asylum, by comparison.

We think that if it is easier to gain asylum than to go through immigration channels that more people who are actually immigrants will seek to have themselves labeled as asylum seekers.

As an example of this, consider how many of the syrian refugees have, rather than staying in greece or eastern europe, pressed on to germany, because they want to live in a wealthier, more powerful country rather than merely stay in the first country that can offer them asylum.

We think that this is unfair to two groups: one, citizens of these countries who now have these people coming in, who have limited skills and limited ability to contribute to the economy, and two, legitimate immigrants, who are now effectively sent to the back of the line, behind these asylum seekers.

Many people have been on waiting lists for immigration for years and years, and now are unable to move to the country that they worked so hard to get into because asylum seekers are taking their spaces.

We think that this is grossly unfair to those groups.

And lastly, we would argue that we should limit the right to asylum in order to preserve it in the long term.

In other words, if there continues to be huge potential for abuse with the right to asylum, then more and more countries are going to get rid of this right entirely.

We think that it would be preferable for countries instead to limit the right to asylum.

That's the comparative in this debate, it's not the continued status quo, where countries are relatively generous with access to asylum.

It is a world in which right-wing politicians, especially populists like donald trump or marine le pen, are able to use the threat of people coming in to take jobs or to work as a tool to become elected, and then to crackdown on issuing asylum at all.

So if you think that it's important that people have access to this right when they need it, such as victims of the syrian civil war, then you need to promote a more conservative use of this right to asylum.

Offering it to too many people will undermine political support from even the most generous populaces.

At this point, we tell you that the right to asylum needs to be limited in order to protect the citizens of the country where these asylum seekers would go on to live, in order to protect the people who are trying to come into the country legally through other forms of immigration, and on top of that, in order to protect the right to asylum in the wrong term long term.

So for these reasons, we should limit the right of asylum.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_3168_year-round-school_con_opening_james","3168","CON","rachel","james","School is perfectly fine the way it is now with students coming in for the majority of the winter year like fall and winter and parts of spring and then having a break over the course of summer during which they can recuperate.

Two areas of clash first on the needs of children.

It is better for the learning of children if they are given time off during the summer rather than first forced to attend school throughout the entire year.

This is because when students are forced to come in repetitively day after day after day even if you have short breaks in between it's still not enough to truly shake off that feeling of being back in school and completely relax before coming back in.

Sure they forget some things but this is better than the opposite world in which maybe they're taught more but they don't actually ending up learning more because they're much more likely to get bored, stop paying attention, and when they don't have summer to recuperate they also stop being able to intake all of that information at the same rates because they are so tired of it.

Maintaining this kind of rigorous schedule takes a lot of energy out of students.

Being able to take the summer and sort of distance yourself from that lifestyle allows students to come back to the at the beginning of the year full of energy and capable of learning all of that information to the fullest extent.

Also we think that it is better in terms of family time when children are not going to school over the summer.

Because with school in session you come home.

You do your homework.

And even if your parents are home from work and they're around you during that time you're often more stressed.

And because you are busy with other things you actually get less quality time with your parents.

More than this we think that weather actually matters in these situations.

So being able to a schedule of education under the summer for a longer period of time rather than only having short breaks in which you might have like in in which a lot of the time the weather might not be as pleasant and you and the kinds of activities you can do during these breaks are actually incredibly limited.

Our second area of clash has to do with why we think that it is better in the long term in terms of life experience first ones to have summer off.

Because recognize that life after you exit school isn't based on classes and the kind of schedule that is held them around it.

Rather it is going to be much more similar to what high schoolers or oftentimes once you get into college and how you spend your summers what those summers look like.

Because when it is during the summer when you actually have time to hold down a nine to five job to do an internship.

So in the situations of high school students it's the only time in which they get to experience what the rest of their life is going to look like rather than just what these current four years of their life are going to look like.

This also applies in situations of resume building we think that a lot of the time the only time that high schoolers have to maintain rigorous internships and take advantage of strong opportunities is during the summer when they have swaths of large amounts of time.

Otherwise large amounts of resources are required in order to put them in situations during the school year where they can allocate that time to these research opportunities or resume building opportunities.

If we want to talk about low income students this is especially important there because while for rich students parents might be able to pay administrations of colleges and get them in either way for low income students if you don't have things to pad your resume schools have much less of an incentive to take you in because you don't provide an economic incentive for them.

So for those reasons we think that it is actually better for low income students if they can build their resume during that time.

But even if they don't want to go to college we think that the only time in which you can make a large sum of money through the that can last you into the year is over the summer when you can work much longer hours than during the school year.

Weaving on their side of the house students on net get less time in which they can stockpile funds that can last them to the school year when they might be able to work a lot less or not all at all because they need to focus on studies for these reasons proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_3168_year-round-school_con_opening_tim","3168","CON","yaar","tim","We in opposition also believe that education is important, but it is not all that matters when we talk about children.

We think that side government is taking this way too far.

They are treating children as if they are robots whose entire purpose is to sit down and and collect as much information as possible so that they could later on help promote society when they grow up.

Their entire line deals with how year-round schooling will lead to better students with better grades and how it's a shame to be wasting time, because we could have been been teaching children more stuff, or on how, god forbid, some students will not be focused in class on there, like, a week before they go on vacation.

We totally disagree that the metric by which this debate should be judged is only what leads to better education as if this is all that matters.

Because if this were the situation, then why not offer that all children need to live in boarding schools and just study for seven for seven days a week, fifteen hours a day?

This way we could have taught them even more, but I think it's fairly obvious to all of us that this is wrong, and it's not just a matter of like how effective this would be.

We assume that even if this would have been effective, even if we truly could have been teaching children plenty more this way, this would still be very, very wrong.

This type of logic may have caught on in some communist country like china or soviet russia, but it completely contradicts every set of beliefs that cherishes individual liberties.

So before I move to talk about the harms of like implementing a system in which you only get one week off every every couple of months, but there's no one big holiday, it's important to note that side government grossly exaggerates when describing the harms in the status quo.

They tell you that that students forget everything and have to be retaught from the start.

First, we just think that that's exaggerated.

We say that studying and is is basically like riding a bicycle, it doesn't really take you a month to to to refresh yourself and relearn.

You pick it up quite quickly after one lesson or maximum two lessons.

B, this could this problem could easily be fixed or solved by handing assignments or homework for children that would have to that they would have to prepare during their summer vacation in order to stay sharp.

Plenty of schools do this, and we have no problem with this.

Regarding like all the rest of their points, again, the fact that we could have taught them more is always true, but that's not how you win this debate, not without explaining why is this so crucial to be teaching children more and more and more stuff.

So, why do you why do we think that it's critical to allow a long summer vacation and we cannot just like we cannot just be happy with one week off here, one week off there.

First of all, because we believe that this phase in life when you're a student is quite reasonably the last like part of your life where you get to have such a long vacation.

Most people graduate and then they find some sort of job, and they will like have an entire lifetime to be working year round, with short vacations here and there.

But this experience in which you now have a full month or two months to just do whatever you feel like is precious and priceless, and we think that it would be a huge shame to be taking away from people the very few times in which they do get to have this, people that will anyway have an entire lifetime to develop a consistent pattern, as they tell us, or a boring routine, the way we would call it.

Second of all, we think that one week vacation is just not enough time to be doing a lot of things, like going traveling to a to a foreign country with your family for more than a couple of days or going to a summer camp where you get to meet a lot of friends outside of your school.

Where else would you get the chance to do something like this if you were learning all year round?

These are experiences that are just as enriching, if not more, than sitting in class and multiplying numbers.

There's more to life than the four walls of your classroom, and there is no better time to go out and explore everything than when you are young student.

We call you to oppose.

"
"tim_3168_year-round-school_pro_opening","3168","PRO","tim","","We should introduce year round schooling.

We think that when it comes to education debates the focus of the debate should always be on what is most likely to result in good education for children, what is likely to lead to a more informed populace in the future, and what is most likely to be effective in actually achieving the goals of educating.

So the model for this we think is pretty clear.

We think that instead of having summer vacation, we would have school all for the entire year.

We think that you're likely to increase we would probably increase the amount of school days that people have but we would also increase the amount of breaks that exist during the school year.

So in the status quo in much of the united states there are like two large breaks during the school year.

One for the spring, and one for the winter.

We would increase these types of one week breaks but we would get rid of the three month layoff that exists during the summer.

Alright so why do we think that this is so crucial?

So the status quo has some very clear flaws.

When we're talking about education, when you're talking about allowing people to really internalize what they're being taught in a classroom, we think that a three month gap every single year between class ending and class beginning is one that is likely going to result in the deterioration of skill.

This is why in many schools the first month, or the first few weeks of class, result in people relearning what they learned in the past year.

For example if you're going from algebra to geometry in high school, the first month of geometry may be composed of relearning the things that you learned the year before in algebra and the reason for this is that teachers and students alike both know that people simply forget the things that they've learned the year before.

Once people pass the test and move on move move on with their life start, enjoying their summer, they're unlikely to actually remember the things that they learned in that class which means that school itself becomes a repetitive practice and it's also a massive time waste that otherwise could be used for teaching other subjects for continuing education.

But more importantly, we don't think there's any sort of consistency to this type of education in the status quo.

We think the way that people are most likely to learn to most likely internalize knowledge is to get a consistent learning pattern develop, to have some sort of study methods that they're able to consistently applied throughout the year but having hiatuses such as summer vacation, don't allow for these consistent patterns of education to emerge and we think that this leads to bad education habits and it leads to people always counting down to summer vacation.

When people always have this one long break to look forward to they tend to turn off especially in the latter half of the school year when they know it's coming close.

If you don't have these types of things we think you have more consistent patterns and what we've seen is success abroad where people have had these types of year round schooling.

In nations that do have this type of schooling, their test scores tend to be higher than the test scores in places like the united states and other areas in which they have this very long lay off in the middle of the summer and we think that we think that arguments that go against this often involve the idea of children wanting to be able to take the time off.

That there's this expectation that parents want to take their children on vacation and do this and that.

But recognized if you give breaks during the year these types of things can still be done.

Children can still get time to take their breaks but you actually also can spread the spread the lessons, spread the tasks out over a longer period of time which means that we think that students while they're in school, are less likely to have the same levels of stress, the same levels of anxiety, and the same pressure upon them as they would when the school year shortened and teachers are forced to cram entire entire courses into a shorter period of time into a shorter period of time and trying to get it all in before they lose the attention of their students who are always looking on to the prospect of summer.

We think that year round schooling has been shown in past instances to be successful.

It is shown to allow for better education patterns, and habits to form in students and we think that simply sticking to the old way of doing things because people are comfortable with it is never sufficient excuse.

We think that year round schooling is likely to result in more educated students, in a more educated populace, and for this reason, we should introduce year round schooling.

"
"james_3168_year-round-school_pro_opening","3168","PRO","james","","We should introduce year round schooling.

Right now, in the united states at least, primary and secondary school students tend to have a large break in the summertime when traditionally you would have had lots of work on the farm for them to do.

Most american students currently go to school for about thirty six weeks in the year.

We propose a system wherein students go to school for twelve weeks with one week break afterwards which would have them go to school for forty eight weeks in the year.

Three arguments for why this is better than what we have right now.

The first is that this would better facilitate student's learning.

During summer vacation students forget much of what they learned in the previous year.

This is harmful for a few reasons.

First of all, we tell you that students lose time at the beginning of the new school year reviewing material which they already have learned.

If students go home for the summer and forget the names of the elements or great british authors or whatever they learned the previous year, and they have to relearn them in the fall, then this is time that isn't spent learning new material.

On top of that we tell you that this facilitates learning because students are spending more time in the classroom.

The only way for students to learn material is to be exposed to it in the first place.

We tell you that by having forty eight weeks as opposed to thirty six of time with teachers the students will simply learn more material.

It doesn't matter if you want students to learn more stem, or to be better informed citizens, no matter what you think education should be doing for students, it can be done better with more time with teachers, with more time to learn.

And I'd also like to point out that particularly for low income students it's likely that they aren't using their time during the summer to better educate themselves.

They might be working or they might just be in child care not really doing anything productive.

So if students are in school year round it's likely that they are reading and doing experiments and other useful activities during the summer instead of playing with water guns with their friends which, while gratifying, probably doesn't do a great deal to prepare them for the work force or for college.

Our second argument is about how this helps parents.

Consider that if your children have a twelve week break in the summer you have to arrange childcare for that time.

Whereas when your children are in school, they are in a safe, productive environment for free.

During the summer you have to pay someone to look after your children if you work.

We think that this places an undue burden on low income parents in particular.

In other words, the families that can least afford to bear the cost of additional childcare are likely to be the ones in which both parents work.

So not only are these families now being forced to pay for childcare, but this is a burden that accrues disproportionately to those worst off in society.

We think that it would be far better to provide free childcare for those people.

At that point when we already have their children, probably in a school being supervised, we might as well be teaching them.

Moreover we think that these parents also are going to have their children on a system more like their own work schedule if their children go to school throughout the year.

Parents can choose to take time off of work when their children have their short breaks which allows them to spend more quality time with their children.

We tell you that at the end of the day this is better than having the children home for the summer without lots of time spent with their parents.

Our last argument is that this would lead to a better use of resources.

Consider that if children are at home during the summer, then schools are presumably sitting empty.

We think that this is a waste of the resources that we've invested in those schools, not to use them year round.

If we have to give them power and air and things like that, we might as well have children in them learning at the same time.

And lastly we tell you that this is a misuse of teacher's time.

That ultimately we would be better off having teachers spend more time teaching and less time working on other projects during the summer.

While no doubt these are of value to the individual teachers, we think that having more face to face time with children would ultimately allow teachers to do their job more effectively and place less of a burden on them during that thirty six week period that they had before.

For all these reasons we should introduce year round schooling.

Thank you.

"will_3169_atheism_con_opening_james","3169","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should adopt atheism.

Two independent points: the first is that a reasonable alternative to like wholehearted belief exists, and that's agnosticism.

Reasonably speaking, this is what we should adopt instead.

So, gov talks you pretty extensively about how if there is no affirmative proof for something, we should actively disbelieve in it.

That is, we should reject it.

I think this is a problem though, because generally speaking, when we say there is sort of insufficient data or insufficient evidence on something, we don't just say, "" well, the case is settled.

It doesn't exist. ""

I think what we have in the status quo is no proof one way or another about whether or not god exists, or any deity, for that matter.

So, I think this is a problem, because there is a possibility of a deity, right?

Things like the inexplicable nature of the big bang open up a lot of questions as to what causes these things.

Regardless of scientific advances, there are always openings in our understanding of the known universe and of time and of all these large questions that are fundamentally unanswerable from our perspective that deities could always have a role in it.

So I think it is not particularly prudent then to outright reject even the possibility of some sort of deity.

Recognize also that science is often reversed.

We are living in a period of unprecedented scientific discovery, but that begs the question then of the fact that we always seem to reject, or at least always assume, that that large amount of discovery is inherently warranted.

Scientific discoveries, though, are often discredited hundreds of years after they're made.

And in recent memory, we have made most of the major scientific discoveries of the modern age.

This is a problem because these things can be reversed.

The things that gov considers like inherent proof that we just cannot assume a deity exists might be reversed in the long term, and I think that that in and of itself is a reason to be agnostic.

Our second independent point is that religion, as an institution, is something that just makes the world a better place.

So even if you put aside all of these things about like whether or not is it rational, we think that just being an atheist makes the world a little worse.

A couple reasons for this: the first is that the afterlife is something that relieves suffering for those who are currently experiencing the most suffering in the moral world.

So, people who are, for example, starving in the streets of like bolivia, which is like largely like christian country, I believe, like can it least to some extent be relieved by the notion that one day they are going to this afterlife, to this heaven, because they were pious individuals, because they did nothing wrong, and as a result of that, they will get to experience eternal happiness.

It doesn't matter if this is true, because it gives them peace at mind while they have their suffering in this world.

That's important.

Because the reality is that even if suffering is non-unique, even if they're going to starve on either side of the house, the the reassurance in their mind, that happiness that is generated by the thought that they will experience an afterlife, has tangible value.

Being happy is a good thing.

So I think we will defend belief systems that allow people to be happy but secondly, we would say that hell, specifically, inspires levels of charity in people.

People that genuinely believe that if they do bad things, they will be punished are less likely to do the bad thing.

Obviously, there are people for whom this incentive structure doesn't particularly affect them.

Obviously, those people exist on the margins.

We would say that if there is anyone who is disincentivized from wrongdoing because they fear punishment, that's a good thing.

Proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_3169_atheism_con_opening_tim","3169","CON","rachel","tim","Just because something has been used for bad things, doesn't mean it inherently is bad.

The mistake that tim makes throughout his speech is that he aligns all of these problematic things with religion.

Sure, people have used religion to warrant bad things, but science has also been used in similar manners.

When scientists claim that things inherent to the woman's body make it harder for her to work, and thus and thus	 warrant why the pay gap ought exist.

When they say that because of someone's race, they are physically incapable of the same kind of workload as others or tend to have certain traits.

We think that in the same way that we don't denounce all of science because it has been used to warrant racist or sexist views, we also don't denounce religion just because people started war over it.

We think that what tim is saying is basically that people are shitty.

But just because people are bad, doesn't mean the things that they do are always the things that they use are also bad.

We think that what matters in this round is the good that religion has done.

Insofar as it is probably the case that people will pick wars on either side of the house, the question is what core beliefs those people carry and how they personally feel about themselves.

Two main areas of clash.

The first on self-actualization and closure.

We think that there are things that can never be explained by science.

Questions such as, why do I exist?

Why am I here on earth?

What is the purpose of my life?

What happens after I die?

All of these are either questions that science will never answer, or that we have to wait hundreds of years to answer.

But we think that people are harmed by the active lack of knowledge about these.

We think that it can cause massive amounts of anxiety to question what happens to your dying uncle after he leaves, to question whether or not there is an afterlife for yourself when you die, and whether or not you'll be able to still see the children that you leave behind.

All of these are things that people need to have closure for that religion provides.

Because having someone say, it's alright, no matter what happens you'll be okay because god is there, is also would allows us to go to the rest of our lives productively without being afraid of these things.

But tim is like oh, but all this does is breed people who are non-skeptical and don't question.

But this just isn't the case, right?

We think there's a difference between believing in a god and skepticism in other situations.

In fact, we think that certain religions teach people to question more.

A certain like a central tenet of judaism is to question the learnings and argue about them, similarly to buddhism.

At the point that we don't think this meaningfully tells people to be sheeple, but rather just says you should believe in this religion doctrine, all this teaches people is to choose to believe in choose to believe things that while still understanding when logic also exists.

The majority of religious people will acknowledge that their belief is not entirely rational, but say that they need it because it protects them from protects them their functioning in other situations.

We think that a lot of massive scientific figures, such as einstein, the cuban doctor who discovered pluripotent stem cells, are people who are highly religious but still understood that you can also be a scientist, also understand logic.

Second area of clash has to do with communities and the good that religious religions have done.

Because we think that religions preach generally good moral things.

And sure, maybe these moral things are pushed upon their population, as tim says, but we just don't think that we care, as long as this means that less people think it's okay to murder others or steal things.

We think that these beliefs motivate incredibly positive things for society.

Millions of food banks, homeless shelters, like other kinds of situations are run by churches and and synagogues and other religious institutes.

We think that they encourage their youth to do things like volunteer, empathize with the poor, recognize people's situations.

All of these doctrines are things that we actually think science lacks, insofar as straight up logic will tell you that will tell you things like you're just not working hard enough to be successful, or other claims.

But we also think that the friendly communities that people form within these religions are incredibly important.

To have someone who believes the same things as you and is willing to support you is very helpful for when you fall upon hard times, or need a community behind you.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"tim_3169_atheism_pro_opening","3169","PRO","tim","","We should adopt atheism.

So in this round we're going to say that individuals on balance should be atheists and that as a society we should lean towards a society that embraces atheism and goes against religion.

Okay so a couple of reasons why we think we should adopt atheism.

The first is based on logic.

So we would say that religious beliefs are antithetical to logic for a few reasons.

The first is that religious beliefs openly denounce openly accept the fact that the beliefs they hold are not based on any sort of factual understanding.

It's based on a leap of faith that individuals take based on some assorted arguments made within with within religious texts but from their faith a leap of faith in the god that they choose to believe in.

It is an outward acceptance that these types of leaps of faith, those that go directly against logic, are acceptable within the society.

We think that when individuals choose to adopt these religious beliefs it ultimately leads to a situation which individuals are more prone to to buy into information without any sort of logical backing.

And we think this is problematic within society.

We think in the status quo we're in a society where information is so dispersed and so disseminated on to people that there is a massive problem with misinformation and people's inability to check themselves.

We think that religion does not breed in and of itself skeptical individuals.

And that skeptical individuals are necessary in a time like today where information and misinformation is becoming so much more outwardly outwardly open and so much more prevalent within our society.

So we think that religion does not allow individuals to become skeptical.

And in fact breeds within individuals an idea that they should buy into the information that they believe and they feel to be correct.

Buying into information based on feeling rather than logic and rather than fact.

We think this is the type of world that is bred in the status quo in which individuals vote against their interests in which individuals denounce science in places like the united states by denouncing global warming because it doesn't feel like it is correct to them.

We think that that type of understanding, that type of way of thinking that is bred by religion, is problematic and should be discarded.

Finally we think that religion on balance has been a negative thing within human history.

Recognize that there is a massive history of conflict associated with all types of religion, whether this is religions warring against each other or people using religion as a justification for types of colonization that we've seen throughout the world, enslavement, these types of things, these systems of oppression were justified on religious basis and these types of systems of repression, while not as problematic, still exists in the status quo with discrimination against minority groups, patriarchal oppression of women and discrimination against LGBTQ people.

All justified under religious beliefs.

We think that these types of backward notions based again on feelings and beliefs rather than on logical understandings of how we should treat our fellow man, these are problematic aspects of religion that society needs to be willing to discard.

We also think that religion pushes morality on to individuals in a way that is unacceptable.

We think that morality as a construct is something that individuals and society should be able to construct based on what is necessary for their times, but that religion pushes all time morality onto a modern society that is advancing far faster than that religion ever could have predicted or ever could have planned for.

We think that these types of values, while in part are still important and in part are acceptable, these are the values that aren't going to be discarded when individuals by and large switch to atheism, but rather the types of discriminatory biases that come with religion and the type of illogical thinking that comes with a religion.

We think these things are discarded when you embrace atheism and that's why we should adopt atheism.

"
"james_3169_atheism_pro_opening","3169","PRO","james","","We should adopt atheism.

By this we mean that people living in western countries today or highly developed countries today should not believe in a god.

So we're agnostic on other forms of supernatural phenomena, but we're arguing that you shouldn't believe in the christian god or allah or similar beings.

Three arguments.

The first is about empiricism.

This is the idea that we should base our beliefs based on what we can observe in the physical universe.

This is the idea that underlies the scientific revolution that's created the world that we live in today.

There is no empirical evidence for the existence of god despite the best efforts of many very intelligent people to prove that there is.

I'm reminded of the famous words of yuri gagarin when he first went into space, I looked and looked but I did not see god.

Ultimately the physical universe has, to date, been able to be explained through natural phenomena, with no need to resort to supernatural phenomena for an explanation.

What that means is that for people who want to define god as the explanation for what we don't know, god becomes an ever shrinking pocket of scientific ignorance.

But what's more, we tell you that it's also problematic to base our ideas of god based on the absence of knowledge.

Short of any positive evidence for the existence of god, we tell you that we ought differ to not believing in him.

This type of thinking has been successful in uncovering various scientific advancements in the past and generally advancing society.

So we think that it's a good standard to apply in this instance as well.

Lacking any positive evidence for the existence of god, we should adopt atheism.

Our second argument concerns truth.

So essentially we tell you that you ought make a good faith attempt to believe what is true.

We think that this is important because if people don't attempt to believe the truth, then it's difficult to form a consensus about how people ought live, act, or behave.

If everyone determines their own, effectively arbitrary standards for what is and is not true, then ultimately people have difficulty communicating with one another.

But by pursuing the actual truth, or the highest truth available to us, we can all come to common ground.

With that in mind we tell you that there are a few reasons not to believe in god.

I've already spoken about empiricism and the lack of physical evidence for god, but we'd also like to point out that people probably ought be skeptical about new claims.

Consider the following, it is not impossible that there is a giant teapot behind the planet jupiter, always blocked from sight on earth by the planet, and invisible to probes chance after as to when they went by the planet jupiter.

But no one believes in this because people apply a certain standard of skepticism.

If someone makes a tremendous claim with no physical evidence, the burden is on them to back it up.

Similarly we think the burden is on people who believe in god to prove that he does exist.

Because the idea that there's a super powerful being that created the universe baffles the mind.

It is not inherently intuitive, it's something that's culturally constructed and we think that it needs to be proven before anyone ought believe it if they're concerned with believing what is true.

Our third and final argument is about the problem of evil.

And this effectively rules out belief in a christian or muslim style god.

Basically christians and muslims believe that god is all knowing, all powerful, and omni-benevolent, which is to say always good.

Yet, the world is an evil place full of horrible things that happened to innocent people.

So it is impossible then that there is a god who knows and understands all these things, omniscience, has the power to stop them or not to have created them in the first place, omnipotence, and is always good, omni-benevolent, because that being, being always good, would choose not to have things like hunger or genocide in the world that we live in.

But at that point where we observe those phenomena in the real world, we think it's clear that that god does not exist.

And since this is the god that most people globally believe in, we think that ultimately we should be atheist rather than believe in such a being.

For these reasons we should adopt atheism.

Thank you.

"rachel_3175_abstinence-only_con_opening_will","3175","CON","rachel","will","The problem with will is that he seems to assume that the only way in which you can tell kids not to get pregnant, is by telling them to only be abstinent.

The problem with this is that you can still have a sex-ed class that says: ""if you don't wanna get pregnant abstinence is the only certainty, "" and then continues to say "" but maybe you weren't abstinent.

Here's how you still prevent pregnancy.

Here's how you still prevent STD's. ""

Then he says that you shouldn't be having sex.

Like, maybe.

The problem with this is that high schooler is exactly around the age in which people are both physically and emotionally developed enough to enter into relationships and begin to consent.

These are also the times in which people learn about consent and learn about healthy relationships, so it's unclear what he gets to be paternalistic about it especially when it isn't effective.

Three main areas of clash: first on why abstinence only sexual education contributes to pregnancy and STD's.

Over and over, abstinence only sex ed has been proven not to work.

All that happens is that kids still have sex but now they don't know how to do it safely.

When you make a subject taboo you're going to want to do it a lot more.

We see this numerous times when with with political parties.

If a if a child comes from a family that is particularly conservative or particularly liberal and punishes the other, than they are much more likely to be the opposite of their parent.

Same applies with sex.

But also, it's just that time of children's development and you're not going to be able to stop them by pretending that it doesn't exist.

So it leads to more pregnancy and STD's because you don't know how to use condoms and you're more likely to listen to trash on the internet.

For example, a lot of, like, still a major percentage of women, or high school students, believe that if you douche with soda water after you have sex this means you're not going to get pregnant.

In reality, all this means is that you're going to have a yeast infection and you didn't use a condom, so you're also more likely to get pregnant.

This is also why you end up with large amounts of outbreaks of STD's, because when you don't teach people about the importance of condoms, they're much more likely to get into not using them by their partner.

Our second area of clash has to do with why this propagates problematic and often sexist norms.

When you're teaching abstinence only, you're automatically saying that it that abstinence is good and correct, and then having sex is wrong.

This propagates the stigma that if you are someone who does have sex, regardless of the message that your school is sending, you are automatically someone who is bad, or someone who is behaving in an improper manner.

This usually targets women because if you're pregnant, then that is like a direct showing of the fact that you had sex, but also because women are often seen as those who are instigators or distracting men.

This is incredibly problematic, given that your value as a human being probably shouldn't be defined by what you do with your body, but rather perhaps who you are as a person, what you've accomplished in your life, etcetera etcetera.

Any other metric besides what you've done before.

Our third area of clash has to do with why it disregards the pleasurable aspect of sex, and leaves people with long term misunderstanding of of sexuality in general.

If you never get to talking about the actual act of sex because you're busy preaching abstinence, you never explain consent, the clitoris, etcetera.

This means kids rely on stereotypes of sex, oftentimes these are male centric.

The concept of a one orgasm being at the end of sex, even though for women these often last a lot longer, or often take a lot longer than what it takes for a man.

You don't learn about the basic parts of your bodies, which makes both genders a lot less likely to enjoy themselves, but you also don't value yourself as much when you are taught your whole life that the other person is more important than you.

So you're much less likely to have healthy relationships built on mutual consent, and much more likely for both genders to end up in situations where they feel pressured to do something and feel bad about saying no.

For these reasons proud to oppose.

"
"tim_3175_abstinence-only_con_opening_james","3175","CON","tim","james","Abstinence only sex education should not be mandatory.

So, in this debate we think that it's important to recognize that the whole purpose of having sex education should be for young people to learn how to be safe when having sexual intercourse, to understand how to be safe and to protect themselves from the potentiality of sexually transmitted diseases or an unwanted pregnancy both of which can be long term harms to the individual and can be incredibly traumatic whether it results in someone having a disease that they have to bear with, a child that they didn't want, or the possibility of having to get an abortion.

All of which can be incredibly traumatic.

We think that people are going to have sex.

Teenagers, young people, are going to have sex with or without with or without this type of sex education.

We don't think that preaching abstinence only is going to be effective in stopping sex and we can see this empirically in the fact that in places in the united states in which abstinence only sex education is the only thing that is allowed, there are the highest rates of unwanted teen pregnancies.

It's because individual students especially, are not prone to listen to the moral preaching of teachers in their classroom especially if they're not being taught the sames things by their parents or maybe additionally when it's compounded by the same preaching they see at home.

Regardless, we think that given that absence only sex education is not effective in resulting in having people practice abstinence only, we think that it's important that you recognize the fact that people are going to have sexual intercourse, that they're going to be sexually active, and that you respond to it.

So that is our main argument.

So why do we think that any other type of sexual education is going to be more effective?

So we think that any other type of sexual education is one, less likely to result in unwanted pregnancies because if you teach people how to use condoms, if you teach people about the potentiality for getting a diaphragm, or for getting a birth control or the variety of other types of contraceptive that are available, we think that these are things that can actually be very enlightening to people.

Most people that are starting to have sex don't know how to properly use a condom and they don't know about the effectiveness of other types of birth control or the rates of effectiveness.

When you're unknowledgeable about these things, you tend to learn from sources that are less reputable.

Some people learn about sex through porn, other people learn about it through older siblings but these are not reputable sources.

We think it's much preferable to have someone that has knowledge of that has knowledge of contraceptive, knowledge of STD's, these types of things to teach real information to students so they can make truly informed decisions.

So they can really decide whether or not they're willing to take on the risks of these things when they choose to have sex.

So we think that having individuals who are actually informed is more likely to result in a decline in STD's and unwanted pregnancy which are obviously problematic.

So why do you think the government has an obligation to inform?

First, we think that the government has it recognized responsibility to educate.

This is seen in the fact that nearly every state has some sort of public education system for students.

We don't think that the fact that we're talking about sex and not about math makes it any different.

That there is still responsibility to educate given that both are crucial to a functional adult.

Secondly, we think that parents are simply not qualified in the same way that students often don't know that much about contraceptive and these types of things.

Parents are often uninformed and even when parents are informed, they're often unlikely to tell these things to their children for a variety of reasons and finally, we don't think that religion is impeded by a knowledge of contraceptive.

Just because you say the word condom doesn't mean that it violates the religious freedom of any person.

It doesn't mean that you're endorsing children having underage sex, and it doesn't mean that you can't include the idea of abstinence in your sex education.

Just means that the government is fulfilling its responsibility to educate and fulfilling its responsibility to keep it citizens safe, and for use reasons, abstinence only sex education should not be mandatory.

"
"will_3175_abstinence-only_pro_opening","3175","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that schools should teach only abstinence-only sex education.

Three independent points.

First is that this is the only effective method of birth control.

When you're talking about really any method of birth control you know the pill, when your're talking about IUD's barrier methods like condoms there's a fail rate intrinsic to all of these.

Part of that is improper usage because you know children are just bad at using things because they're children but also because the intrinsically to the the nature of the product itself it just fails sometimes.

There are hormonal reasons when you're talking about hormonal birth control and then also with barrier methods you know when you're mass producing something in a factory there are just certain things that are faulty you know condoms break things like that.

So at that point then it becomes important to educate children properly, to tell them this is the only way you will be able to ensure that you're not going to you know get pregnant or get an STD is to have sex in a manner or just did not have sex rather because that's all you can really do to have one hundred percent certainty.

Our second independent point is that children really just shouldn't be having sex yet.

I think it's important to recognize that at this age children are poorly informed at best and I don't think sexual education is really going to mitigate that.

I'll get more into the flaws of the the process itself in a bit but it's important that at such a young age you're not going to have you know meaningful consent because meaningful consent is predicated on the capacity of the participating parties to have some sort of like reasonable, well rounded understanding of what they're getting into.

And specifically with sex,which can have incredible consequences on children for a long time when you're talking about you know pregnancy or STD's, this is something that they're just not ready for yet at this age.

So it's not reasonable then for schools to teach them you know here are the tools to go out and do this thing that you shouldn't be doing no matter what.

The third independent point that I'd like to put forward is that just broadly speaking even the the concept of sex education that is you know teaching children safe-sex practices is inappropriate for teachers to discuss.

I think generally speaking this is something that you know maybe parents can make an individual decision on whether or not they want their children to learn about these things but this isn't something that should go on in a public school because there are legitimate reasons for parents to not want their children to you know be exposed to this discussion at such a young age.

Different children develop at different rates, different parents have different parenting styles.

So there's perfectly legitimate reasons to say that this just isn't something that an individual parent wants their children to be exposed to.

At that point, it's inappropriate for a public school system to broadly have this conversation with every single student that's int it because that does essentially endorse the position that this is something that we should universally expose children to.

At the point where there's reasonable deviation from that standard and where this is particularly sensitive information that parents would have a legitimate reason for fully blocking children from even being exposed to, it's reasonable to say that we should only teach abstinence and that any other additional information can simply be provided by parents who would like to have that conversation with their children.

Proud to propose.

"
"james_3175_abstinence-only_pro_opening","3175","PRO","james","","Abstinence only sex education should be mandatory.

So basically by this we mean education for young people in secondary school that would teach them to wait until they're married before having sex.

This is already common in certain parts of the united states but we think that it should be required everywhere in liberal countries.

So a few reasons why we think this should be implemented: the first is that we think that abstinence only education has the power to prevent teenage pregnancies in many instances.

The reason why is that if you implement a more comprehensive type of sex ed that teaches young people about birth control and other forms of safe sex practice, is that information will go in one ear and out the other.

Young people will hear that it's okay to have sex and not actually bother to learn how to put on a condom safely or not actually bother to take their birth control in a responsible way.

And that ultimately what you've done is sexually empower people without actually giving them the information to be responsibly sexually empowered.

This is likely to lead to many teen pregnancies and we've seen that in some school districts in america, I don't claim all but in some, comprehensive sex education has coincided with a rise in sexual activity.

Given the tremendous harms, particularly to young girls if they have children while they're still in high school, many of them don't finish high school, they're much less likely to go to college, their lives are effectively changed drastically for the negative if they do get pregnant.

So we think that if there is a risk that comprehensive sex education does encourage people to have sex without actually being responsible, then we should defer to having abstinence only sex education.

Our second argument is that we should respect the democratic will in countries.

So in the united states in particular, a large part of people actually support having abstinence only sex education.

So we think that if the public wants to have abstinence only sex education, then it's not the government's place to decide that that's right or wrong for them.

We think it's probably the case that government shouldn't dictate that one way of life is better than any other way of life.

Instead they should defer to what individual people want to do.

But obviously some stance is necessary in terms of what we teach in public schools.

At that point we think we should defer to what the majority of people think, rather than having a minority of well educated elites make a decision about what's actually best for them.

Because these countries rely on democratic will for their legitimacy, we think it's illegitimate to make decisions that are unpopular with the public on social matters.

Our third and final argument is that in a world where comprehensive sex ed and abstinence only sex ed were both followed, we think that it would be a better world with abstinence only sex education.

So we recognize, first of all, that neither program is going to be completely successful.

That some young people will have sex even if we have abstinence only education.

But we think that ultimately if you could imagine a world where everyone was having safe sex in high school, in a world where no one was having sex in high school, you would still have fewer teen pregnancies in the absence only world.

At the point where that's our biggest concern, to prevent people from ruining their lives by having an unplanned teen pregnancy, we should defer to abstinence only because when it is applied effectively it would mean no one had the potential to get pregnant.

Whereas of a portion, a small portion admittedly, of people having the safe sex would actually get pregnant.

Whether that be from, you know misuse of things like condoms and birth control.

So ultimately we think that because you would have a better world if this were applied perfectly, that it is a preferable policy to take.

That we should try to do the best job possible with the best policy, rather than implementing another policy that, when both are applied imperfectly, might sometimes be better.

So for all these reasons we should have abstinence only sex education in secondary schools.

Thank you.

"
"rachel_3178_covenant-marriage_con_opening_james","3178","CON","rachel","james","When it comes to covenant marriages, it's unclear why we need the government to recognize it, given that individuals and communities can still recognize it personally.

Drew never points out why there are specific benefits to the government recognizing these marriages as well, except to say that it is more easily regulatable, and I'll tell you why he's wrong about that later.

Two main areas of clash, the first on why these kinds of marriages trap people, and often especially women, in marriages that might not be happy in the long term.

Recognize first, that even though people might get extensive counseling before entering a marriage, they might think that they know these people so well, it is often not the case that you can predict everything that will occur in your future.

No one gets married thinking that it will end in divorce.

The reason, that we do not put up extra barriers to divorce, is because we recognize that these kinds of that people change, and that and that we have to let them escape and change themselves, as their relationships change as well.

Drew is so worried about freedom, but he decreases it by making these assumptions.

He says that people who enter are going to be so consenting, but we don't think this is true.

We think these individuals usually grow up in these communities, and are pressured to participate, and more than this are often not provided with another option.

It is only after you are an adult, that you can actually be able to explore the rest of the world around you, and recognize what your real decisions meant, or what you have signed yourself up for.

So, a lot of the time these people get married quite young, around eighteen to twenty, and it's not until later in their lives, that they recognize what they gave up, or have more access to the outside world.

So, we think that when you do things, like recognize covenant marriage by the state, you are not only allowing these people to be pressured by their communities to maintain an unhappy marriage, but also allowing the state to put pressure on them as well, and preventing the state from interfering in the situations, because it recognizes this covenant as legal.

We think women are especially susceptible to this, insofar as a lot of the time these communities place less value on female happiness, and force them into patriarchal roles in the house, and they're like often given the least choice over their futures.

So, we think that, at least on our side of the house, if someone decides that they're done, they can get state backing to escape the situation.

On their side, you make it so that the government can no longer interfere in these marriages, when someone says I am done, because it recognizes the covenant as legal, and forces them to continue through these difficulties.

Our second of clash has to do with why it gives even more power and control to religious communities.

We think that the church and the state ought be kept as separate as possible, because the state obligation ought to be to people, not to religious bodies.

And when you recognize covenant marriage, you secede more control over people's lives to religions.

We think this is problematic, because religion is often run by patriarchal, outdated, and sexist norms.

So, a lot of the time, in these kinds of religious covenants, not only are women being given away very young, not only are they like being told that things, oftentimes, that like birth control is immoral, they're not really given control over their own bodies, their pleasure is vilified, but now the state recognizes these acts as legal, and says: okay, like were all right with this, let religion take that control.

When drew says that it's easier to regulate, he's just wrong, because the only time, that this is regulatable at all, is when it's not legally recognized, because that recognition binds the state to specific action.

So in the status quo, if there is a covenant marriage, and someone says I'm done, and the religious community says no you're not, you agreed to this, then the state is obligated to say that the religious community is wrong, and side with the individual.

But on their side of the house, what occurs is that because the state has recognized this, they must allow the church to go on with its proceedings.

Drew pretends these proceedings are no big deal, but recognize that you can draw out counselling infinitely.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"sam_3178_covenant-marriage_con_opening_tim","3178","CON","sam","tim","I stand firm opposition to the motion: we should introduce covenant marriages.

As an overview, I want to discuss what this motion is actually doing.

Because people can still have covenant marriages but they cannot be recognized by the government.

It is unclear why two evangelical individuals need the government's accommodation to force them into these covenant marriages.

If two people continue with their evangelical beliefs and truly believe that their marriage ought not be disrupted, than they can simply not get a divorce.

They can have a non binding agreement to have a covenant marriage.

However when government steps in, it truly removes any option from harmed parties while also pushing government into religion and religion into government.

It is terrible to set a precedent in which religious individuals can pass their traditions into law.

This is the sort of reason why queer individuals, particularly in the united states, were oppressed.

Evangelicals were able to put their belief into law and pass anti sodomy laws, and then pass anti gay marriage laws, which made it so queer individuals were oppressed by the state.

At this point there is very little utility to be gained by the government recognizing the sort of marriage, but very clear precedent for profound harm.

Additionally though, we have two more arguments to show why covenant marriages are bad.

First off on future rights - it is unjust to sign away your future rights in such a drastic agreement.

There are three conditions in which future rights can be signed away in a meaningful way: first, that these future rights will come back after a particular expiration date that is not incredibly far off.

Covenant marriages are intended to last until death.

The inability for these contracts to simply go away or expire means that these people have signed away their rights in perpetuity.

It is unclear if they will hold the same religious belief or hold the same love that push them into the marriage, and as such they are oppressing their future selves.

Secondly though, unpredictability.

There is literally no predictability when going into a marriage.

People change when you live with them, people change when you have a child with them, people change when you've just spent enough time with them.

It is impossible to predict what will happen after a marriage, and as such there's not good predictability.

When people sign contracts traditionally, it is with a great understanding and a huge amount of work which allows the law to step in were certain conditions met.

Even if conditions were written into the covenant marriage which allows them to get out of it if they're say being abused, these can always be hidden as I'll discuss my next argument.

Finally though, the another way you can sign away your future rights is if there is profound utility from the having this contract in place.

But as I already discussed, individuals could have a covenant marriage between them but do not need the government to recognize it and otherwise restrict the rights of one or both parties.

At this point there is no reason why the government should step in and allow people to oppress themselves or oppress their spouses using a covenant marriage.

The second argument I'd like to put forward though, is that leverage is important in the sort of relationships.

In abusive relationships, divorce is an an incredibly important form of leverage to get a party out of that marriage.

When individuals live in an abusive household, they live under a condition of profound stress which at times can be akin to torture.

The government has an obligation not to torture enemy combatants, so it very clearly has an obligation to its own citizens, to let them get out of torturous situations.

Very briefly I'd like to address the point of children.

Because, while tim is right that living in a household with a good marriage is preferable to living with divorced parents, it is clearly preferable to live with divorced parents than a terrible marriage where people are shouting all the time and giving their children anxiety or other conditions.

As such, we oppose covenant marriages.

"
"james_3178_covenant-marriage_pro_opening","3178","PRO","james","","We should introduce covenant marriage.

So covenant marriage is a legal category of marriage which is available in three states in america.

Basically it requires that the people who are engaged obtain some sort of premarital counseling and that as a result of this after they get married it will be more difficult for them to seek divorce for instance, they might be required to live apart for a certain amount of time or otherwise face higher legal barriers to divorce than other people would but I'd like to point out the divorce is not impossible after receiving a covenant marriage only relatively difficult.

Very few people have taken advantage of this in america even though it's been around for a couple of decades.

So now that we have some groundwork for the debate, I'd like to advance a couple of arguments for why we should introduce covenant marriage.

First, we think that people deserve to have as many options as possible about how they want to define their marriage and their relationship to the state.

There are two parts of any marriage.

First of all, you have the relationship between two individuals.

Obviously people should have the maximum amount of freedom possible when creating a relationship with another person.

We think that people have a right to self-actualize that this is implicit in the laws of many countries that give people the ability to speak, to live, to do what they want and that ultimately, because of this, we should extend a lot of freedom to people in terms of establishing relationships with others.

But marriage is also a legal contract.

So this also involves one's relationship with the state.

We think that again, people should have the maximum amount of freedom to define their relationship with the state.

If existing forms of marriage don't offer what you want to receive from your relationship with the state of which you are a citizen then we think that whenever reasonable, the government should try to accommodate you for instance, by introducing things like civil partnerships for gay people.

We think that covenant marriages fill a similar role for certain religious communities who want to have more barriers in place to divorce because they think it's unethical.

Ultimately there's very little harm to offering people the ability to have a covenant marriage.

No one's being forced to take it after all.

If people want to get a traditional marriage they still can and we've seen in the US states that have adopted it, that many people do but on top of that, divorce is also not impossible in these covenant marriages.

So it's not like it's fundamentally a different type of relationship with the state than any other type of marriage, it's just one in which it's more difficult to nullify the contract.

With this in mind, we think that there are very few drawbacks to introducing this policy.

It clearly has a benefit to some group of people even if most people won't take advantage of it and it doesn't actually harm anyone.

Everyone who participates is freely consenting into it and ultimately the contract is consistent with other principles.

With that in mind, I think it's clear that we should introduce covenant marriage.

But aside from that, we tell you that it's very likely that people are doing something similar to this whether or not the state condones it.

At that point we think it's better to regulate the practice rather than just ignore it.

What do I mean by this?

Religious communities already put barriers in place for their members to get divorced.

They might require that people meet with a priest or a counselor before pursuing a divorce for instance.

For members of these communities even though there is no civil or secular law preventing them from getting a divorce, these religious regulations may as well have the force of law.

We can see this is true because people hold very deep and serious religious beliefs which tell them that divorce might be unethical, or that they need to respect the words of a religious elder.

So with that in mind, it's likely that people are already facing barriers to divorce.

We think that by introducing this to the legal sphere you can do things like limit the potential for abuse for instance, facilitate people getting a divorce if there's been spousal abuse in an instance when their religious community might not be as supportive.

So with these ideas in mind, we should introduce covenant marriage.

Thank you.

"
"tim_3178_covenant-marriage_pro_opening","3178","PRO","tim","","We should introduce covenant marriages.

To be clear we wouldn't institute a system in which covenant marriage is mandated but rather we would allow for there to be a legal option to be bound under a covenant marriage as opposed to a standard marriage that exists within society.

And this would of course would come with the constraints of making it much more difficult to receive a divorce with different types of pressure being placed on the individual to ensure that they stay married in the long run.

We would say that these covenant marriages can be annulled if certain requirements would be met but we've set those apartments at a much higher level than marriages are in the status quo.

Okay so firstly, about the option for religious expression.

And the secondly, what long term marriage does as a social good.

Recognize that even if society doesn't believe that should adopt certain religious values, having the option of a covenant marriage option that recognizes the importance religiously of not having divorce, of staying married, does not ensure that a state endorses any particular religion, but rather simply gives individuals within that state an option of more full religious expression.

It means that individuals can go to a or go to the state and have something legally bonding placed upon them that helps them stay true to their faith.

We think this is important because for those most faithful individuals, we think that they should be forced to consider the ramifications of their decision more clearly before they get married.

They should be forced to recognize that the bond they are taking, even if it is not in the status quo legally binding in perpetuity, is one that because of their belief system, is permanently binding.

And we think that if a state apparatus can allow for that faith to be more meaningfully expressed, if it can allow for that faith to be more fully expressed, and if it puts constraints that makes people seriously consider their faith more, when it only applies to individuals that have that faith, we think there is no loss in instituting this type of system.

We think it's good that individuals are able to have the most full type of religious expression because these types of religions these types of religious beliefs about marriage and about connection with a spouse are so fulfilling to individuals in the status quo.

So aside from the religious benefits, we think that there are real benefits to long term marriage that a covenant marriage helps to protect because it makes it such much more difficult to get divorced.

Firstly, it ensures that if you it insures that because you're thinking more about your marriage you're more likely to marry someone that is going to be a stable partner.

So whether or not you love your partner, a permanent partner does allow for an immense amount of financial and social security even in instances when you may be struggling.

When you're tied to someone and when you have a partner in life that is going through the same types of struggles you are, that is bound to your struggles, it makes it much easier to bear the burden of that struggle.

It also means that if you're having a long term marriage, you're much more likely to have a stable household for any potential children.

Children have no choice about what type of familial household they're going to be born in and it's just statistically true that single parent households are much more likely to lead to a situation which a child struggles moving forward in life.

We think that covenant marriages, because it makes it more difficult to get divorced, is more likely to ensure that you don't have single parent households.

That you have a situation in which both parents feel a responsibility to stay for the child.

Finally we think because we think finally we think there's a benefit some think that you're less likely to get into a legal battle over assets which can be not only struggling and detrimental to any sort of semblance of relationship you have with the person you're getting divorced from, but can also leave you in immense destitution moving forward in life.

We think that marriage as an institution allows you to have a partner, allows you to support children potentially and allows you to be in a more stable situation.

Given that covenant marriage is not mandated but rather an option.

We see no downsides the government introducing it and that's why we should introduce covenant marriage.

"
"tim_3180_goal-line_con_opening_yaar","3180","CON","tim","yaar","We should not introduce goal line technology.

So, I think what's important, for framing the discussion in this debate, is to recognize what sport is actually about.

Because, in oftentimes when people talk about sports, especially fans of sports, there's often discussion of values, like valor, and honor, and tradition, and the spirit of athletics and competition, but recognize that sport, whether it's soccer, whether it's basketball, or any baseball, or any type of sport, these are all intrinsically about entertainment, whether it's at a at a young age, the entertainment of playing the sport, the the entertainment of growing from the sport, but as far as to goal line technology, as far as professionals, it is solely about the entertainment that you can bring to fans.

That the sport of soccer exists in order to make money for the owners of the team, to make money for the players, to make money for all the people involved in the creation of the product on the field, and that what matters, when making this decision, is what is going to be the best for fans.

So, when people make claims about how goal line technology allows for more accuracy, and things like that, that is not intrinsically valuable, unless they can explain why it's valuable to the fans, why it gives a better fan experience.

So, we have three reasons why we think that, it's less likely to lead to a good fan experience, and why we shouldn't introduce goal line technology, based on that reason.

The first is that, it slows down the game.

Recognize that in soccer, delays simply do not exist, in the same way that they exist in other sports, that soccer is largely about the flow of the game, about setting up plays, about the back and forth, and about ensuring that you that there's some sort of a flow and a rhythm to watching the game.

We think that goal line technology is more likely to be invasive in soccer, than it is in any other sport, that it' that the flow of soccer, the flow of the game, is so much more important to the entertainment, to the product that you see, when you're watching the game on the pitch, than it is in almost any other sport in society.

And given that this is the case, we think what's likely to happen is that fans are less likely to watch the product on the field, even if they're not less likely to follow the sport generally, they're less likely to actually give the views on on TV, and on the internet, that that provides ad revenue for these types of sports, and when that exists, we think that you're likely to get the downfall of the not the downfall of the industry of sport, but you're less likely to get revenue from the sport, and that's bad for all actors involved in the sport.

Secondly, it removes faith in referees.

So, we think that when you institute goal line technology, you're less likely to have people have faith in referees, because it's a signaling affected: if you introduce this type of technology now, it means that there's some sort of reason, that you think, that referees are not sufficient in doing their job, and yes, it is the case that obviously, voyeurs can see whether or not refs are right, when they can like look at the replay five seconds after, and yes m sometimes refs are wrong, but when you do this type of thing, you signal that you think refs are wrong so often, that they need to have this type of thing, that interrupts the flow of the game, that literally stops the game for a number of minutes, so they can go and watch one more time, or a number of times, what happened right in front of them.

Given that that's the case, and that there are the trade offs of interrupting the flow of the game, we simply think you shouldn't send that signal to fans.

Finally, we think that there is, honestly, a tape of bonding that occurs in booing referees, in booing officials, when they get something wrong.

We think that as fans, you experience the struggle of the team, when there's a mistake that happens on the field in the refereeing of the game, and you become closer to the people on the field, because you can empathize with what they're going through.

They're struggling to win a game, and in the moment, they've been stripped of something that a referee is wrong about, it allows you to connect with the people on the field, and connect to the people in the stands, to bond.

And yes, it may mean that you get a less accurate reflection of the score on the field, but it provides a more community oriented feel to the game, which is less which is more likely to attract people, to keep following the game, and increase revenue.

And it's ultimately more likely to be entertaining for people who interact with the sport.

And for these reasons, we should not introduce goal line technology.

"
"will_3180_goal-line_con_opening_james","3180","CON","will","james","I am proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should introduce goal line technology in football games.

Two independent points.

First is the human element that is associated with the status quo.

We think that sports in general have a disturbing trend that they're moving towards in adopting technology to replace the rules of humans.

This is problematic a, because we think that a significant portion of why we enjoy sports in general has to do with that human element of it that is the impressiveness of seeing human beings achieve individual feats and we think that extends as well to the refereeing that this is something that we care about having that human connection with but b, because we think that a lot of decisions that are made in football and other sports have assess a certain context associated with that is that there is a need to make subjective decisions on individual things and that when you introduce machines into these sports, you lose that capacity to make contextual decisions from the human perspective.

With specific regard to goals in football, you know we think that there are different situations in which you know the computer technology can fail to appropriately record whether or not a goal is made based on essentially the parameters that are initially fed to the machine.

This is a problem then for two reasons.

One, we think that it sets a trend in football towards machine recording in general.

So I think even if you don't believe that goal line technology is specifically an abuse we think that this sets in motion a slippery slope of moving towards more machine based recording and decision making in sports that is less capable of accounting for the context of a specific action.

But secondly, we think that it's a problem because because there is abuses that are going to happen in real time essentially that you won't know the machine has an intrinsic issue with it until that issue arises and makes that mistake and because of the nature of the way that football works, you can't go back on that decision after it's been made if the call's been made then the call was made and you've made that decision for goal line technology to supplant the role of the referee in that scenario given that we think that it least at the beginning there arw inevitably going to be faulty calls because the machine will essentially be tested out in real time in actual games where those faulty decisions will essentially become law.

Our second independent point is hacking.

So we think that obviously there are some arguments that gov brings forward about subjectiveness and potentially even corruption amongst referees.

Largely we think that this is a fairly silly.

Referees are generally hired by the league and are fairly objective.

The problem with goal line technology then is two fold.

The first is that it is a computer run and as such it is subject to hacking sports fans care very deeply about the outcome of games and we don't think it's you know hard to imagine somebody you know making that decision to actively tamper with this technology in an effort to benefit their own team but beyond this we think that actually the goal line technology is often managed in house through technology housed in individual stadiums and as such teams themselves can actually manipulate this technology with relative ease that then opens a significantly easier door for corruption and problems within this technology that we think mitigates the usefulness of this certainly defining accuracy but also in terms of the fairness that gov touts.

Proud to oppose.

"
"yaar_3180_goal-line_pro_opening","3180","PRO","yaar","","We should introduce goal line technology.

And I guess that the question in this case should really be - why not?

Meaning, I think that the main burden in this debate, not like other debates, should primarily be on the opposition side to explain why not use this technological improvement that all it does is just make sure that referees are making less mistakes and the game gets a little fairer.

We need to understand: no matter how good or experienced you a referee at a football match is, he is still a human being and can still make mistakes.

He's unable to see everything always and always be right.

Especially not when he runs around on the court side for ninety minutes straight and when there's a lot of pressure from the side of the fans and the teams and the coaches and so on.

This is a recipe that can easily effect any man's judgment.

We also need to understand that deci decisions such as this, like was there a goal or not, are often decision that mean a lot a lot of money for a lot a lot of people.

So this, again, adds to the pressure but it also makes this decision something of value.

It's important to make it right.

So eventually we don't think that this has anything to do, it's not like a moral question that's complicated and requires a human judgment in any form, it's a very technical question: did the ball cross the line or not?

And these are exactly the types of questions that a computer with sensors can know the answer to much better than humans do.

It can be argued that some of the beauty of the game is exactly the fact that it doesn't involve any technology and that somehow worth the occasional mistake, but it's unclear why this is true when such mistakes are costing millions of dollars.

And in addition we'd like to point out that the use of these assisting technologies is already a common practice in many many other sport fields.

In tennis we can like a a player can challenge the decision off the referee and let the simulator determine whether like there was a point or not.

In basketball referees often request to take a look at the cameras when they're uncertain about a certain thing.

And we think that it would be extremely hard to argue that these games has become any less exciting or good than they were because like due to the use of this technology.

So in conclusion, we say that we are only talking about a very small change that's entire effect is that it prevents human errors, prevents regretful human errors, and is making the game more fair to everyone.

The burden is on the opposition side to tell us what on earth could possibly be wrong with that.

Please propose.

"
"james_3180_goal-line_pro_opening","3180","PRO","james","","We should introduce goal-line technology.

So we're going to argue that this technology which allows referees to use a computer to check whether a goal was actually scored should be used in high level football competitions, such as the premier league, champions league, la liga, and world cup.

We think that whenever possible, these technologies should be implemented in a league, but we recognize that some smaller leagues might not have the ability to do so.

We think that ultimately this would be beneficial for the leagues and for football as a whole.

Three arguments for our side.

The first is that this should make football a more fair sport.

It's important that fans perceive that a sport is fair if you want them to watch.

And realize that all of the money that football teams bring in is contingent on people watching the sport.

They sell advertisements and spots on TV and seats in stadia, and these are how they make all of their money.

So this is very important for the leagues and the teams within them, as businesses.

Goal-line technology makes the sport more fair because now you're able to objectively measure whether a given goal was scored.

Right now we can have highly trained officials try to make a judgment call but at the end of the day, it will never be as accurate as having a computer make that determination.

We think that when fans understand that something completely objective is determining whether or not goals have been scored, that there will be a better appearance of fairness within the league and that many people who don't watch football right now, because they think it's rigged or because they think that it's not fair, would be more likely to support the sport and spend their money on it if we introduce this goal-line technology.

In particular, at a time when more sports are becoming popular in traditional football areas, such as basketball gaining popularity in europe, we think it's important for leagues and for teams to improve their reputation and improve their standing in the community.

Our second argument is about accountability for officials.

While match fixing is relatively rare in both football and any professional highly organized sport, we think that it's important that we take every step possible to limit match fixing.

The reason why is that all of the harms listed above to having a worse reputation, such as fewer viewers and less advertising money, are greatly multiplied by the perception that the officiating is unfair.

Right now, if there's a perception that popular players or popular teams are given more credit by the officials, then that feeds into all the harms we told you about earlier.

Where goal-line technology makes football a better sport is that it introduces independent accountability for officials.

Someone from the league or someone from fifa or another body can go in and see if the referee was actually making a legitimate call.

This makes match fixing basically impossible, because referees can't lie about who scored what goal.

So all of the benefits above come through uniquely from goal-line technology.

Our third and final point is about having football conform to international sporting norms.

While it's true that football is the most popular sport in the world, it's not growing as quickly as some other sports.

Basketball, in particular, is rapidly becoming more and more popular worldwide.

We think that it's important that football conform to the expectations people have for sport more broadly if it's going to grow in areas where it hasn't been as popular in the past, such as the united states, and maintain its status as the most popular sport in countries where it's very popular right now.

If you're a new sports fan in america or china and you're deciding whether you want to spend more money on football or basketball, one thing you might ask yourself is which one is more fair, so or which one seems more legitimate to you.

And because other sports, like basketball, like baseball, use technology comparable to goal-line technology, it's important that football do this as well so that they're able to keep fans and to attract new fans.

So for all of these reasons, we should introduce goal-line technology.

Thank you.

"
"sam_3181_same-sex-marriage_con_opening_james","3181","CON","sam","james","I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should support same-sex marriage.

As a brief overview, I want to say that when we say marriage, we don't mean the collection of tax benefits and other recognition that individuals get from the government and institutions.

We would say that same-sex couples should get the same sort of tax benefits as heterosexual couples.

In the same way, we would say that things like hospitals and insurance programs should provide the same benefits to same-sex couples as they do to heterosexual couples.

However, we think that the label of marriage is reserved for particular couples and particular institutions, that same-sex marriage is fundamentally an oxymoron with this in mind.

Three arguments to support this motion: first, marriage is inherently religious.

Marriage as an institution comes from a long history developed by religious institutions.

It was fundamentally a way in which two individuals of the opposite sex could come together and be married before god.

If you look at marriage vows, around the world, particularly historical marriage vows, they were all about religious individuals coming together before god and making a union.

At the point where these religions fundamentally oppose same-sex marriage, it is unclear why we should enforce the will of the government and enforce the will of these couples against their own religion.

At the point where someone thinks that they are going to hell if they support a same-sex marriage, we think that the utility gained by having a label upon your union versus the disutility which comes from fundamentally violating your religion and violating your community and ignoring the systems of belief that you grew up with, we think it is clear that individuals should be able to refuse to provide same-sex marriages.

In the same way, we would say the government can continue to ban same-sex marriages insofar as marriage, once again, is an inherently religious institution.

If there is a particular community which want to support same-sex marriage, they're going against the teachings of historical religion, and as such are not being true members of that religion.

So we would say that same-sex marriage still would not be religiously permissible.

My second argument is that marriage is also inherently oppressive.

It is a patriarchal system which put women below men and forced individuals into situations that they did probably didn't want to be in.

It took away the autonomy of both partners from splitting from the union and really abandoning their partner when they feel like it would be the most utile.

As such, we would say that marriage is inherently bad.

It promotes problematic norms within society and propagating it by supporting same-sex marriage simply expands these problematic norms even further.

Anti-marriage activists also the anti-same-sex marriage activists insofar as whenever you support marriage, you're supporting a problematic institution which continues to oppress women around the world and largely leads to power imbalances within relationships which we think are inherently problematic.

Our third and final argument is that this is a waste of resources among activists.

Supporting same-sex marriage on a government level will lead to a huge number of people leaving the LGBTQ movement and activist forces.

When schools were desegregated in the south, the civil rights movement lost a huge number of white allies simply because they thought the fight was done.

In the same vein, supporting same-sex marriage and passing same-sex marriage laws means that a huge number of straight activists will leave the community and stop fighting for the goals of LGBTQA people.

As a result, things like trans rights, things like gay homelessness, will continue, and these are far more problematic.

I don't really care if two straight people, excuse me, not two straight people, two gay people can get married, particularly if they're wealthy people, if queer teens are still on the street dying due to homelessness.

As such, we think the harms as a result of losing activists is far greater than the benefits of simply labeling a particular union.

As such, we oppose same-sex marriage.

"
"tim_3181_same-sex-marriage_con_opening_will","3181","CON","tim","will","We should not legalize same sex marriage.

So, we want to be very clear in this debate, we're fine with allowing for civil partnerships between a same sex couple.

We're fine with giving same sex couples equal rights in in the legal realm, equal protections, equal visitation rights, the ability to raise children together, we don't think that same sex couples should be barred from starting a family together, and giving the legal recognition, that such a family in such a structure deserves to be granted with.

What we would say principally, is that the state itself should not be involved in marriage at any level.

We would say that marriage is, historically, a patriarchal and religious tradition, that is firstly, an outdated means of giving away a woman to a man for for a property exchange, but more importantly, it's an inherently religious service.

Recognize, that for the vast majority of history, the state didn't come together to wed two groups of people, it was churches, it was religious institutions, that would do these things, and we think that that is where marriage should be.

We think it's fine to have civil partnerships in at the state level, we think it's fine for individuals to conjoin their assets in the way that marriage allows them to do, all those legal aspects of marriage can be done without giving it the label of marriage, without giving it that religious connotation, that we think is so problematic in the status quo, and is the real reason that people are same sex couples are denied access to this thing in the status quo.

But, even if it seems hateful, we think that religions should have the freedom to do what they see as necessary, to follow their faith, as long as it doesn't allow for people to have a lower level, or a lower quality of life, and we think that if you allow same sex couples to access the same legal protections, that a married couple otherwise would, we don't think that there's a major detraction to same sex couples, as far as their quality of life is concerned.

So, we think religious freedom is crucial.

Religion allows if you allow for religious interference in this instance, in in this occasion, we think it will inevitably lead to future marginalization of religious communities.

We think that what you're ultimately going to get is that you have a state that is willing to back religions that back the vast majority of individuals, and that marginal religion, and marginal communities, are likely to be stamped out.

We think that that's problematic, because we think that faith and religion are crucial to one's identity.

They not only give you an understanding of your place in the world, and the after life, and all these things, but they also give you moral power, they give you the the moral ideas that you hold with you in your life, and they allow you to make decisions in difficult situations.

All of these things are crucial, and yes, while some of these things may be based on outdated notions, that liberals don't agree with, we don't think that it means that people don't receive value from these things, and that they're inherently problematic.

We think we think that if a faith doesn't allow this type thing, you shouldn't force them to do these things.

We think that the only legitimacy that the government has, as far as dictating religions, is that it forces religious individuals in the public sphere to treat other individuals with an equal amount of respect, as they would to another religious individual.

We don't think that that amount of respect in in order to achieve that amount of respect, you necessarily need to ensure that people are able to have the same sex marriage.

We think that giving them equal legal and political accountability, equal political rights, and equal recognition, even if you don't put the name of marriage onto it, creates a balance between the religious freedom, that these institutions deserve to have and the protections that same sex couples also need to have.

And for these reasons, we should not legalize same sex marriage.

"
"will_3181_same-sex-marriage_pro_opening","3181","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion that we should ban that we should legalize same sex marriage.

I think the model for this is pretty intuitive, right?

Just like a government should just recognize same sex unions and that you just change the definition of marriage from a man and a woman to just to individuals who consent into the marriage.

Three independent points under this: first, that autonomy is something we should respect including for gay people, secondly that bans on gay marriage increase instances of homophobia, and thirdly that there ought be a separation of church and state and in so far as the opposition to gay marriage is largely religiously based, we should recognize that like this is a poor reason to oppose gay marriage.

So, first on autonomy.

I think it's worth recognizing that autonomy is a good thing.

It is the most fundamental right that we have.

The reason why we care about life is that we can do things and not like condemned into slavery, right?

The reason that we care about our health is because that enables us to actually have decisions like the ability to do the things that we want to do.

Autonomy to the maximum extent is always going to be good in a vacuum.

When the government is justified in infringing on autonomy?

It's because that autonomy comes into conflict with someone else's autonomy.

So like murder for example is banned because we recognize that when one person kills another person, that limits the person who is killed's autonomy to a very large extent.

So, we look at these two things that we say: "" oh okay well you know, your right to kill someone is a lot less important than your like right to just be alive. ""

So we restrict the thing that restricts the other person's autonomy.

So, there has to be an externality to an action.

A way in which somebody else suffers or has their autonomy limited as a result of your actions in order to for a ban to be justified.

The problem is that gay marriage doesn't have externalities.

People aren't affected by this, right?

Like if I engage in a union with another man, someone standing down the street or someone else in society isn't affected by that union in a meaningful way.

And even if they are like peeved by it, or they find themselves made slightly uncomfortable, we think that is a much less significant harm tan the harms that will be enacted upon myself and my partner by not being able to engage in a lawful union.

That leads me into my second independent point that instances of homophobia and harms upon gay individuals are magnified by a ban.

This is true for three reasons: so, broadly that it normalizes homophobia.

That it normalizes the idea that being gay is like the other and is not acceptable within mainstream society.

So three harms to that: first it increases instances of assault and discrimination because it normalizes the idea that gay people or the other and that you can treat them like the other.

That you can engage in housing discrimination or that you can assault on the street, things like that.

So when you take down the veil, when you say: "" no, it is okay for these people to enter into legal union "" you take down the legal basis or at least the societally justified basis for why it is okay to discriminate against gay people.

Second is it creates identity crisis of most especially young gay people that they think that this thing that they experience, that is completely natural, completely acceptable and doesn't affect other people's lives in another way, isn't okay because society has told them it's not ok, because there are these legal signals that their identity is wrong.

So recognize then, that that is a harm.

There is massive psychological trauma associated with that.

That is why like suicide amongst gay teens is so massively massively high.

Thirdly, when you push people onto the fringe of society, there are harms intrinsic to that.

So like, for example, how like a lot of gay people used to have to be prostitutes.

Like in the, you know, the eighties and even today to a large extent, because they are put to the fringes of society and are told: "" you are not good enough to be within like a normal context of society and act as a normal member of our society "".

So, the third independent point I'd like to advance is the separation of church and state and why that's an intrinsically good thing.

Like recognize that the opposition to gay marriages largely religiously based, that there's like some textual arguments about this from like christianity particularly, but it's important to note that the state shouldn't be involved with like shouldn't make policy decisions on a religious basis.

That it shouldn't favor particular religions or even religiosity in general when compared to secularism because that necessarily favors one group in society over another.

It's for this reason, these reasons rather, that it's important to recognize that the opposition to this policy is fairly ridiculous.

Proud to propose.

"
"james_3181_same-sex-marriage_pro_opening","3181","PRO","james","","We should legalize same sex marriage.

So I'm going to argue that countries around the world which had the rule of law and which generally protect people's rights should allow people to marry those of the same sex in the same way that they allow people to marry those of the opposite sex.

We don't think that domestic partnership programs like what they have in germany right now are sufficient.

We think that it needs to be an equal form of marriage with what people who are marrying someone of the opposite sex have access to.

With that in mind, three arguments for our side.

The first is about equality under the law.

Right now, in germany for instance, if you happen to be attracted to the same sex you don't have equal protection under the law as someone who is attracted to the opposite sex.

They are allowed to marry whoever they want and whoever they love and you are not.

We think that fundamentally because the law in germany as well as in other liberal countries around the world is predicated on the idea that all citizens are equal citizens that this is fundamentally unfair.

You cannot claim to have equality under the law if some people are able to enter into a contract and other people are not.

In particular, we think this is egregious because sexual orientation is an intrinsic characteristic.

Research and the experience of millions of people around the world tells us that people don't choose who they are attracted to, but rather this is something that is intrinsic to us.

This is similar to the way that we don't choose our sex or our race so we ought not be discriminated against on those terms.

We're, broadly speaking, fine with limiting people's rights based on things like age which change over time, but not based on things like sex or race.

We think that sexual orientation is more like the latter than the former and therefore that we ought guarantee equality under the law for people regardless of their sexual orientation.

And this would necessitate allowing people to marry whoever they want or whoever they love regardless of that person's sex.

Our second argument is about the legal benefits to same sex couples.

In america, I know, you're only allowed to visit someone in the hospital if you're a close relative.

So brother, sister, son, father, husband or wife.

So before gay marriage was passed here many times you would have a person's long term partner, someone they had been with for thirty years, who wasn't able to go visit them in the hospital because they technically weren't a close relative.

This is just one example of the types of legal discrimination that gay people face if they aren't able to marry.

We see that because the law privileges marriage over other types of relationship through things like legal privileges and tax status, that we have to allow these benefits to accrue to people attracted to the same sex as well as those who are attracted to the opposite sex.

Otherwise legal discrimination against those groups percolates through every layer of society, which we think is fundamentally unacceptable, especially in liberal countries like germany.

Our third and final argument is that it is good for your country or your area in the long term to legalize same sex marriage.

We see that many areas in the united states which legalized same sex marriage early on and which gained a reputation for being tolerant, saw an influx of highly talented workers.

Many people move to cities like boston, where which was the first major american city that had gay marriage, because they saw that it was somewhere that was more accepting of their lifestyle.

Where people were more likely to treat them as equals than other parts of the country where they were denied access to certain legal protections and the right to marry.

In the same way areas like san francisco that have historically been associated with tolerance for homosexuals have also seen that people move there because of this tolerance.

So it becomes a pull factor that brings in qualified hardworking people from around your country or around the globe even if you legalize same sex marriage.

So this ultimately is beneficial to the whole community, not just the people who want to have these types of marriage.

For these reasons we should legalize same sex marriage.

Thank you.

"
"james_3182_universal-health-care_con_opening_daniel","3182","CON","james","daniel","We should not introduce universal healthcare.

I want to clarify a couple of things before I launch into our three constructive arguments.

The first is that this universal health care implies that people have some sort of buy in, whether that be requiring people to have private insurance as is the case in some countries, or introducing some sort of public insurance scheme like the united kingdom has.

Ultimately people are paying for their premiums either in the form of taxes or payments to a private insurance company.

And all universal health care does is require everyone to do this and not allow people to choose to opt out as they used to be able to in the united states.

So from this perspective, even the united states, which requires people to purchase private health care, has universal health care.

Our first argument is that it is unfair to make young people subsidize older people.

How does health insurance work?

Basically healthy people have to buy a product that they don't need in order to let less healthy people get that product at an affordable price.

So young people who probably don't need to go to the doctor more than once a year for a quick check up are forced to pay for very expensive insurance schemes so that elderly people who consume huge amounts of resources are able to receive those same treatments more cheaply.

We think that this is fundamentally unfair.

People ought not be forced to subsidize others and take on huge risks to themselves.

But I think in particular that it's unfair because elderly people are not asked to subsidize young people in the same way.

In countries like the US or britain for instance, young people have to pay huge amounts of money to attend university and don't receive public subsidy to do so.

So ultimately we think that this is a one way street, that you're requiring younger people to pay for the elderly and not investing in a similar way in helping the young.

We think that if anything, society should work the other way.

It should take from older people who have had time to accrue more resources and give it to younger people who haven't and who represent the future.

This also punishes healthy people by extension.

If you run every day for your whole life and eat a healthy diet, then you're much less likely to need expensive health care in your old age than someone who smokes a pack a day and eats nothing but cheeseburgers.

So healthy people are being forced to pay for the health insurance of people who made worse decisions.

This, one, disincentivizes people from making good decisions and two, punishes people who did make good decisions, which we think fundamentally is unfair.

We think that if you choose to make decisions that make your health care costs lower, that you shouldn't have to bear the higher cost for those who didn't make those good choices.

At the end of the day, forcing everyone to pay for health insurance, whether through a government scheme like national health in britain, or through mandatory private insurance like obamacare, is unfair to many groups of society.

It either punishes them based on an intrinsic characteristic like age, or it punishes those who made good decisions and privileges those who made poor decisions.

We think either option is unacceptable.

Our third and final point is that this forces people to fund controversial treatments.

In the united states no federal money may be used for abortions.

But we still see that government health money goes to fund things like treatments that would not otherwise be covered.

For instance treatments that use stem cell research which many people consider to be unethical.

We don't think that people ought be compelled to pay for treatments which are contrary to their own moral principles.

To do so undermines the ability of people to live according to their own ethical principles when they don't conflict with anyone else.

If people want to receive abortions we think that that's fine.

If people want to use the products of stem cell research we're similarly okay with that, but we think that it's wrong to compel christians to pay for that, which necessarily a national healthcare scheme that pays for those things would do.

So at the end of the day we oppose forcing people to purchase insurance because it's unfair to certain groups based on their beliefs.

Thank you.

"
"will_3182_universal-health-care_con_opening_james","3182","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should guarantee universal health care.

Our first independent point is that guaranteeing universal healthcare is particularly expensive and creates a significant drag on government coffers.

The united states is a good example of this where already eventhough we're not even covering everybody a significant portion of our country's spending is sunk into health care costs things like medicare and medicaid.

This isn't a cheap thing to provide for people and one of the fundamental reasons for it is that the more coverage is sponsored by the government the more of the healthcare costs.

The reason for this is a what's called a a principal agent issue that is when the person who's paying for the good isn't the person who benefits for the good.

There's a problem both in terms of the quality of the good provided but also in terms of the incentive of payment.

The united states government faces political pressure to make payments regardless of what the quality of the care provided is as such then they are often going to pay increasing amounts of money for the same costs.

This is a problem because the money that the united states government pays doesn't come from like thin air it comes from the government's coffers and this is money that can easily be reallocated to more effective uses of capital while healthcare is a facilitative right other things like housing and food are also facilitative rights so we think at the point where the government has to make active decisions on what it's going to spend its money on we think that it is better for the government to spend money on something like housing programs or snap benefits which will ensure that facilitative rights are still being met but it will do so in a way that doesn't actually create ballooning costs within that industry.

Our second independent point is that there is a need to consent out and we think this is a fundamental right.

We think the people should specifically have the right to consent out of healthcare.

This is an informed decision that is that people often will make it a conscious decision about whether or not healthcare is a smart bennett is a smart investment for them and we think particularly younger people often see that they are quite healthy and not in need of paying a significant portion of their income towards health care rather they would rather just keep the money and given that the chance of them needing to go to the hospitals quite small spend on other important things like food and shelter.

The issue though is that if universal healthcare is guaranteed even if there's an opt out capacity there can't be an opt out capacity you need something like what the united states on obamacare an individual mandate to ensure that the system will operate because the functional nature of health care pools is that you balloon up the costs that are going to be created by the sick people by having the healthy people pay into it.

This is a problem then because if we find that individuals have a right to consent out of this product and make the active decision that they're not going to sink their money into something that they don't need than the system fails.

Either you engage in mass rights violations or you just have a failing health care system.

Either way this is significantly worse than the status quo.

Our third independent point is that providing universal healthcare is redistributive economics and those are bad.

So specifically what we mean is that how the providing universal healthcare at the point where most wealthy people already have health care anyway involves taking money from wealthier individuals and putting it into public social spending programs that will then be reallocated to poorer individuals.

The problem with this is that wealthy individuals have a rights claim to their property that is the capital that is then being taxed in then reinvested into poor individuals.

We think that quite often they earned this money giving them a particular deserve claim to it but beyond this we think that it is also a fundamental violation of one's property rights to take their property from them forcefully.

This in turn is a significant abuse on the part of the government.

Proud to oppose.

"
"daniel_3182_universal-health-care_pro_opening","3182","PRO","daniel","","We should introduce universal health care because it's both a moral responsibility and smart policy.

So let's start by talking about why the introduction of universal healthcare is a a moral responsibility, and I think that a lot of this comes down to the very basic idea that people suffer, people die, and if we have the ability to help them, it's worthwhile to do so.

There's a whole lot of reasons for this.

It could be because if we were in that desperate situation, we would want that help.

It's because it's just a basic level of empathy that we don't want to see people in pain.

At the end of the day, I think it's just the idea that this is a kind of suffering that we can prevent at, honestly, not that much of a sacrifice, and it's therefore worth the cost.

And I think that it's only about healthcare that we really look at these things in that way.

If you look at the idea that police officers shouldn't help people who are poor because they don't have as much of an ability to fund police departments via taxes and things like that, most people would probably agree that's a kind of ridiculous concept because, of course, like police officers should be helping prevent crime.

Like if a poor person is getting murdered, that's not any worse than if a rich person is getting murdered, and I think that that's not all that different from healthcare.

Possibly like getting shot by a weapon or things like that isn't you're going to be just as dead if you're going to die of cancer, but you can't afford a lot of the treatment because you don't have health insurance and these things aren't covered, and it's not going to make all that much of a difference to you how it happens to you.

And I think that we're talking about human lives and this is very important is on a moral level.

But the next thing that I want to talk about is about why I think that this is smart on a policy level.

And in most places around the world, if it's an emergency situation, hospitals are going to just turn you down based on an inability to pay.

They may discharge you earlier, you may get more limited treatment options, but they're still going to take you in.

If you're like having a severe medical crisis, hospitals are gonna do that and at least in places like america.

And that's a problem because preventative care is less expensive than dealing with the consequences in both like hard terms and softer terms.

In hard terms in that it just often costs less money to do regular checkups, regular screenings, removing things maybe before they become cancerous or the like, making sure that you have access to like a healthier lifestyle.

All of that is ultimately better for someone's life and wallet and the state's wallet than having to deal with incredibly hefty medical bills from specialized care as a result of lack of preventative treatment.

But in addition to that, it's also better in a a broader soense in that obviously it's not great for the economy if a lot of people are getting sicker more often, if people are dying more often, and things like that.

Like when people put off care in earlier parts of their life, it makes things like , in america, medicare for older people or specific support for elderly people, or it burdens employers who whose employees can't work as much.

All of these things add up in cost and since health is something that affects everyone, it has an incredibly massive effect on on an economy, and it ultimately results in money just getting wasted and lives getting destroyed.

And for all those reasons, we should introduce universal healthcare.

"
"james_3182_universal-health-care_pro_opening","3182","PRO","james","","We should introduce universal health care.

So by this we mean to say that every country around the world should guarantee that all of their citizens have access to basic health care.

So, this might look like the national health service in england or it might look like an expanded version of obamacare, where private insurers but offer everyone insurance similar to the status quo in the US but more extensive.

We're okay with any policy that ultimately ensures that everyone in your country can go to the doctor, can fill prescriptions, and can receive emergency care.

Three reasons why.

First: we tell you that access to healthcare is a human right.

Why is this so?

Well, the first reason, if we think about rights that arise by convention or agreement, is that UN member states have all agreed that there is a right to healthcare.

We see that many UN member states offered charity and aid to other countries to guarantee that those countries' citizens have access to health care, because it's recognized as a fundamental human right.

But it's also a facilitative right we tell you.

Most every country in the world guarantees people some rights: the right to work, the right to vote, the right to speech, to practice a religion, and all of these things are contingent on access to healthcare.

People who are dying because they lack access to pharmaceutical drugs and the like can't access other political rights.

So we tell you that we need to introduce universal health care in order to uphold people's other rights which are more explicitly granted by their nation's constitutions.

At that point, we see that this is both a right by convention and a facilitative right, so it's clear that we should introduce universal health care in every country.

Our second argument is actually that universal health care will save nations money in the long term.

Let's think about what happened in america back before obamacare.

Many people would get sick and not go see the doctor because they didn't have access to health care.

Then, they would go to the emergency room where the law requires doctors to treat them.

So someone who started out with a case of pneumonia that it would have cost fifty euros to treat with antibiotics, now goes to the hospital and consumes thousands of dollars of health care, because they need their lungs drained and they need intensive medical treatment that lasts for days.

So we see that ultimately we would have saved a lot of money by offering this person a a primary care physician or a family doctor, depending on what they call them in different countries, rather than having them turn to emergency services.

But what's more, we also see many people go bankrupt in the US and some other countries although, fortunately, few of them, because of a lack of access to healthcare.

People, for instance, who can't go to the doctor, go to the emergency room, run up enormous bills, and then declare bankruptcy.

Which means that the hospitals lose money, and ultimately those hospitals have their debts written off by local or state governments because, let's face it, hospitals have to be funded somehow.

So, ultimately, we think everyone would save money, and this would help both individual citizens and also hospitals and municipal governments by offering health care.

Our third and final point is about economic growth.

So, I'll talk about first developed, then developing, countries.

In a developed country, like the united states, we think that the economy would grow and be more stable if more people were employed in the health care sector.

Ultimately, increasing access to health care will also increase demand for healthcare, which will lead to a health care boom.

In developing countries, we tell you that a major problem is that many people are unable to find work because of illnesses that are easily preventable.

Many people in nepal, for instance, have cataracts and eye disease that causes you to go blind.

This is easily treatable but ultimately, people without health care can't access that.

So they're not able to work.

They become a drain on their community.

But with basic access to health care, these people would be able to work once more and to contribute to their community.

So, ultimately, for these reasons, we should introduce universal healthcare.

Thank you.

"
"will_3183_racial-profiling_con_opening_james","3183","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should increase racial profiling in airports.

Our first independent point is that there are rights violations intrinsic to this practice.

So, first we think that these are fundamentally arbitrary practices that while there is certainly a stereotype of our minds and perhaps even a statistical correlation of like black and brown individuals being more likely to commit these crimes, we don't think that a, it is to an extent that is significantly higher enough that warrants mass rights violations inflicted upon people of these races but b, we don't think that the crimes of the few should make the many suffer.

That is to say that just because a few individuals of middle eastern descent are you know members of terrorist cells that inflict harm upon others, that doesn't justify subjecting the hundreds of millions of people that happen to be of the same race to enhanced interrogation techniques essentially.

So specifically what is the nature of the rights violations that we're looking at?

I think it's interesting when government tells you oh we're not going to strip search or like do any of those other over the top things we're just going to be engaging in enhanced searching.

So I want to clarify that if enhanced searching isn't strip searches and other stuff like that, I really don't know what it is because like absent the thing where they just kind of like swab your hands down like that's it like that that that's what enhanced searching is.

When they pull you over in line like that's what they're going to do.

So I think it's important then to recognize that there is a significant burden placed upon innocent individuals who have done nothing wrong and simply happen to share a skin color with people have done something wrong.

That in and of itself is a rights violation, specifically a violation of one's rights to privacy that is insofar as privacy is you know key to a lot of other rights like the ability to you know do is one please without fear of retaliation unnecessarily, but it's also a violation of one's right to bodily autonomy, to have as one pleases done to one's body.

We think that you know strip searches especially are extremely invasive and definitely constitute a significant rights violation in terms of that.

Again, it is probably fair for gov to say that these individual violations don't amount to the same as an individual right to life for example that stems from like an airplane attack.

We also think that these attacks are so rare that it in the aggregate the rights violations that come from random interrogations probably outweigh the significance of like those like another nine-eleven as is demonstrated by the fact that nine-eleven was like sixteen years ago.

Our second independent point is that racial profiling isn't effective.

It's easy to dodge because if you just recruit people that don't match the profile then you can just have them carry out the attacks instead.

Like isis has white people and those white people can just conduct the attacks if really explicit racial profiling actively distracts the TSA from looking into people who aren't brown.

Given that, we think it's just like a bad way of ensuring safety and at that point then I think a lot of govs offense about specifically protecting innocents right to life falls through.

If anything, this is the worse tactic of insuring people safety and as such actively infringes upon those rights.

Our third independent point is the narrative that centers around racial profiling.

So, specifically, govs gives them lip service to the notion that you know we'd rather have racial profiling happen explicitly than implicitly, implying that racial profiling is something that happens anyway.

I think the problem here is that when it happens explicitly, that's actually a boon for recruiting for terrorist cells.

Terrorist cells specifically do the recruiting on the basis that people feel alienated from society at large and specifically individuals of middle eastern descent often feel the effects of islamophobia in a very real and tangible way.

Cells like al qaeda and isis then utilize that sense of alienation to recruit individuals into being terrorists.

This of course is a huge driving force in their ability to conduct attacks, so we think it's problematic then when things that could easily be cast as blatant islamophobia are able to be shaped into that narrative and are able to you be used to affirm the notion that isis says you know you are an outcast of society, join us and we'll fight against the oppressors.

Proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_3183_racial-profiling_con_opening_will","3183","CON","rachel","will","Three areas of clash as to why racial profiling ought not be allowed in airports.

First, it is no longer relevant.

There was a time when due to regional originality of certain groups of people racial profile was incredibly effective.

Because in the end, the majority of isis were iranians.

But this has passed as soon as racial profiling became a known tactic.

This is because terrorist organizations aren't stupid.

They know that a brown man or a religiously dressed women are more likely to be stopped, so instead they recruit white kids to do their dirty work.

What this means is that instead of actually finding terrorists or likely criminals, all that racial profiling accomplishes is creating a distraction from the real culprit and making it less likely that you're actually going to find them.

Because while you're busy patting down the guy with the accent, the person who actually has the dangerous item is much more likely to slip by unnoticed.

It it's also no longer relevant because airport security has gotten so tight that it's incredibly unlikely that anything will at smuggled in in the first place.

At the point that you get stopped for aerosol cans that are actually just your deodorant, and metal detectors exist that scan your whole body seamlessly, we're not sure how exactly someone is going to get by with a weapon in the first place.

Our second area of clash has to do with why it's rights violative.

In the united states you are innocent until proven guilty by our constitutional rights.

When you use racial profiling you pre-assume someone's guilt based on their race.

Therefore, not allowing them innocence until there's proof.

This is rights violative since now that person is treated like a criminal, and stripped of their rights to their autonomy or to their property regardless of whether they actually committed the crime or not.

In fact, they most likely didn't in the majority of these kinds of situations.

At the point that we still exist in the united states, we don't think that the government just gets to suspend these rights for efficiency's sakes.

If that was the case then you have a special clause in the constitution that said you can become authoritarian when you feel like it.

But we have these kinds of laws in place specifically to protect from authoritarian regimes.

Because sure, right now we're afraid of muslims and isis.

But these kinds of things can become more and more expensive if the justification can be security.

In the end anyone can become a security threat, and the things that you can do in order to protect the security of a certain nation can also become infinite.

We think this kind of slippery slope is incredibly real and we see this in other countries.

That say they host democratic elections but then slowly take away rights to internet, as we see currently in russia, because of security issues and being afraid of hackers and viruses.

Meanwhile what they're actually doing is suspending protesters and anyone who doesn't agree with the current government.

Our third area of clash has to do with why this is uniquely traumatizing and why people ought not be forced to go through it.

If you're innocent getting randomly searched based on your race can be incredibly traumatizing.

Given that not only is this often like it physically obnoxious system in which we're being patted down and touched by a stranger, but it's also humiliating.

Oftentimes you're in front of people you know and you don't want them to see you in that situation, and not only this but you're also often in front of strangers, who you definitely don't want to see you in this situation.

It also teaches children to be afraid like teaches children who are not of that race to be more afraid of that race, and so raises the general fear in society, and it also teaches children of that race to hate themselves a little bit more, given that they are much given that they're being stereotyped and labeled as terrorists and it like basically leads to them not feeling safe within this nation.

For these reasons proud to oppose.

"
"will_3183_racial-profiling_pro_opening","3183","PRO","will","","I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should increase racial profiling in airport security in the united states.

Three independent or two independent points.

The first of which is simply accuracy.

I think it is fairly clear from looking at you know crime records and statistical records that there is a strong correlation between specific ethnic groups and like criminal activity.

I think this is also true to an even greater extent of criminal activity that airports are concerned with.

A large number of like plane hijackings and bombings and things like that have been committed by individuals of middle eastern descent and it is notable that this is not because of anything intrinsic to the race but rather because of just like particular parts of the world.

The correlation with these crimes is obviously much stronger with the point of origin than it is with the actual race itself.

Nonetheless it is not actually possible to you know verify point of origin especially when you know people that are going to commit the significant crimes probably have falsified documents.

Given that then the next best proxy is race and this is important.

Op is going to tell you that the the thing we should be doing is basically tracking criminal activity rather than tracking the race.

I think the problem though is what we're talking about specifically when we're talking about airport terrorism is is really a set of criminals and terrorist organizations that are so refined in tactics that it's not really possible just to track you know indicators like you know whether or not they're like holding water bottles or whatever whatever criminal patterns might you know correlate with with with airport security issues.

I think one reason for this is just the small data set, that it's difficult to build a statistical model that accurately tracks the behaviors of the airport terrorism.

But secondly it's it's it's just not something that's easy to detect because of how you does explicitly it's designed to avoid detection.

This is a high-impact crime and as a result there is a lot of you know a lot of care that goes into constructing a a criminal profile that is designed to evade security.

And as such you need proxies that are easier to identify, to figure out how you narrow your scope down to you know potential perpetrators and one way to do that that is extremely accurate and correlating with the criminal profile is race.

And this brings me into my second point and really beating back I think what is going to be the main line out of opposition and that's specifically the rights violations.

I don't think it's a reasonable to contest that there are inherently rights violations that are associated with racial profiling.

The problem is that as is the case with any rights debate you have to weigh this against the high magnitude of the crimes that are going to be perpetrated, something like an airplane bombing or a hijacking puts a lot of people's lives in danger.

So I think it's important then to ensure that you're going to take really really clear steps to ensure that this does not happen no matter what the cost you know stop and frisk is also something that has rights violations this is yes it's obviously profiling it's obviously going to infringe on you know concepts like innocent before proven guilty but if the tradeoff there is you know dozens if not hundreds of lives then I think that's a reasonable tradeoff that's the more significant goal that we need to work towards is ensuring that access to your right to life essentially.

Proud to propose.

"james_3183_racial-profiling_pro_opening","3183","PRO","james","","We should increase racial profiling in the united states at airports.

So in this debate what we're arguing is that whereas right now the TSA, the security group at airports, often denies that they use racial profiling, or is forced to search people they don't want to search to avoid the appearance of racial profiling.

We should allow them instead to just openly racially profile people.

A few reasons why we think this is the case.

First of all safety.

Recognize that the reason why we have groups like the TSA in the first place is to promote airport security and to prevent another nine eleven attack from happening.

At the point where we know that the people most likely to carry out massive terrorist attacks are people from groups like al-qaeda, and at the point where those groups recruit primarily among certain populations of a given race, we think that since we're going after al-qaeda we should target the people most likely to be al-qaeda members.

Now some people might say that this is contrary to the principle that you can't discriminate against people based on their race, but we think that ultimately the trade off in terms of safety outweighs the harms to some people's individual freedom which is relatively modest.

We're not talking about like strip searching people and having cavity searches and things like that.

We're just talking about enhanced security for some individuals.

Our second argument is about fairness.

Now some people might say that it's unfair to profile one particular group.

But we think that what is being done right now is actually worse.

Because recognize that this profiling still goes on in the status quo to a great extent.

What happens in order to disguise it is that the TSA will stop one young apparently arab man at the airport and that in order to avoid charges of discrimination stop three old white women at the same airport.

We think that it's unfair to externalize these costs on to people who are very unlikely to be members of these terrorist groups and who have done nothing wrong in order to cover up this practice.

In either world racial profiling is going on.

The only question is: is it fair to punish other people in order to disguise this racial profiling?

We think that it would obviously be more fair to discriminate against fewer people, to make fewer people go through these procedures, and that therefore we should just allow explicit racial profiling at american airports.

Our third and final argument is that public will is in support of racial profiling.

Why is this important?

The united states derives its legitimacy is a government because it rests on the will of the people.

The american government is not a group of technocrats who decide what is best for the country, it is a group of representatives who are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents.

At the point where the united states is something like sixty five percent caucasian and overwhelmingly christian, probably over eighty percent, we think it's almost certain that a large majority of the country supports racial profiling against people of middle eastern background.

We think that at that point the united states must follow the will of the people, even if it has ends that are morally intolerable to some individuals.

Recognize that in the past the US has carried out lots of unpopular policies that were technically legal because of public support.

We think that we need to continue to do so now.

And if these policies are actually country to the constitution, then we should have supreme court rulings in place that prevent it from happening again.

In the meantime though, it's not up to the executive branch or individual legislators to decide what is in the best interest of the american people when they've made their own wishes fairly clear.

We think that in order for the american government to maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens it needs to implement popular, well-liked policies such as racial profiling at airports.

So ultimately, because racial profiling is going to go on either way, we think that it would be more fair to use it explicitly, and we think that the american government's legitimacy relies on public support and so therefore the policy should be implemented.

Thank you.

"
"will_3184_internet-censorship_con_opening_james","3184","CON","will","james","I'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should increase internet censorship.

I want to begin with a quick overview that I think addresses the lion's share of gov's material and that is that if specific materials are illegal anyway, we don't think that internet censorship is a necessary tool to enforce those laws.

Something like child pornography is illegal in its own right.

The production, distribution, and ownership is itself a crime, so we don't think then that it's actually necessary to even shut down the websites because we think they're just other avenues through which you can prosecute the individuals.

If somebody downloads child pornography, that itself is a crime.

There's no need to bring down the medium because you can just prosecute the existing crimes that are on the books.

Censorship then seems an to be an unnecessary tool for most of gov's impacts.

Our first independent point is that there is a freedom of information intrinsic to the internet, and that on this basis, government intervention is unjustified.

We think that there really two basis for this.

The first is more tied to freedom of speech, that is sort of the autonomy that is intrinsic to you know basic human rights, the freedom to do with your life as one pleases, and this is rooted in the fact that people are the best proxy for their own interests.

We think then that it is unreasonable for governments to limit their you know basic our basic rights to access things that we please and that make us individually happy, and as such, absent things that are already illegal for obvious reasons, we think that government limits on what sort of information and what sort of materials we can access are unjustified.

Even if this is something like you know isis ideology there is still a problem intrinsically with people intervening in individuals' want to access that material.

But I think the second problem with these restrictions is that there isn't objectivity that's intrinsic to any government.

We think that no conception of the good life is inherently correct, insofar as our preferences are often shaped by the societies that we grow up in.

So our perceptions of things like religion and things like justified uses of force are shaped by that society, not by any sort of like universal moral code that is inherently objective.

As such, it is unreasonable for governments to enforce a specific moral code.

But secondly, and I think this sort of ties back into it, our second independent point is that there isn't a justification for jurisdiction over the internet because the internet is something that is international.

We think then, because this is something international in nature and not defined by state borders, it is unjust for individual governments to intervene in the type of information that is conveyed over it.

Look at the you know the basic nature of this is that it is a way for people to communicate across state borders, and it is a subculture in and of itself.

No government has the right to intervene in this as such.

Our third independent point is that it warrants persecution narratives.

So I think even if you take the objective moral code and you say, okay this is what is inherently right and this is what is inherently wrong, I still think that there is a pragmatic problem with internet censorship, and that is that often these sort of like dredges of the internet your your neo nazi and your isis fighters thrive off of narratives that paint them is persecuted.

The reason for this is that they often recruit people themselves who feel that they are isolated from the rest of society or rejected by it, and as such when isis or neo nazis or whomever can essentially put forward a narrative that says we are persecuted too, we are also being targeted by the masses of society, there is you know a better ability to recruit essentially that they are more capable of bringing in large numbers of people to their cause.

We think then that there is a significant amount of backlash associated with internet censorship, and that because it is impossible to fully regulate every corner of the internet, you can never achieve a full shut down of these organizations.

Rather, you can just push them further and further underground where they are tougher to fight and where they are more capable of bringing in large numbers of people who themselves see themselves as rejected.

Proud to oppose.

"
"rachel_3184_internet-censorship_con_opening_daniel","3184","CON","rachel","daniel","Internet centrist censorship should definitely not be increased.

First to clarify the round we think that it's fine if individual forms in their sub laws say we will remove language that is hate speech language that is bullying this is what we do not tolerate in our forums.

We think what this round deals with is specifically if the government is increasing internet censorship and using their power to censor what people on the internet are saying.

Two main areas of three main areas of clash first on free speech and why it's violation occurs.

We think that regardless of whether my speech is mean or derogatory unless I am calling to violence or actively higher harm I'm harming someone else it is protected.

This is because speech is a away by which individuals actualize themselves and communicate themselves to the world.

Silencing them essentially means erasing their existence given that if no one knows my thoughts my feelings or my emotions then they cannot validate that I exist in the world and have rights.

So it is the same thing as me not being there.

More than this though we think that a lot of the time the speech that one person might consider to be mean or an attack is speech that is valued by others.

There is no universal standard by which we say this speech is valuable but this speech isn't because we think that when it currently metric by a standard the black lives matter movement often uses is they like to say fuck white people or insult white people as a race.

We think that this is probably acceptable given that this is in insinuation that talks about the like years of oppression that have occurred then is often used productively.

The problem is that the same people that when the opposite occurs when someone says fuck black people this is something that would be considered hate speech and rightfully so should probably not exist.

The issue is that it depends on who is in power.

Should you have a republican or a bunch of white supremacists in power they're much more likely to say it is fuck white people that ought be erased and censored not the opposite that is okay.

So we think that in the end at the point that everyone is going to consider a different type of speech valuable and my speech is a way by which I relate to the world we think unless you're actively harming someone or calling to violence then that speech is protected.

Our second area of clash has to do with why we think it lends more growth to dangerous ideologies when you censor them.

First we think that people use the internet as an outlet and because I can go on to this forum and yell all my racist thoughts I am much less likely to go into real life and shoot someone but also we think that the only way in which you can destroy these ideologies is by facing them head on and clashing with them.

Because if you can never point out the holes in a theory because you've banished it and not allowed it to enter the internet or the marketplace of ideas then the people who made it will still think they are right.

The only way in which you can truly beat it down is if you are able to tell the rest of the world why they are incorrect and keep them from gaining popularity and followings.

Our third area of clash has to do with why it's open to government abuse.

Sure in an ultimate world where liberals are in charge then at least me and fellow liberals are happy.

The problem is that the conservatives still aren't and we would say that this is still oppressive and abusive of other people who have valid ideas.

But recognize also that governments change over time.

We think in a world where trump very recently got elected and the majority of both the senate and the house are republicans it is very possible that the ultra right does gain power and they change the standards in which we see.

And suddenly the censorship isn't hate speech that I might consider hate speech and it isn't like the kinds of it isn't the kind of mean or bullying things that I might consider mean or bullying but it flips the other direction it becomes censorship of liberal ideologies and censorship of progressive movements and protests.

For these reasons proud to propose oppose.

"
"james_3184_internet-censorship_pro_opening","3184","PRO","james","","We should increase internet censorship.

By this we mean that countries in which the internet is basically laissez faire and not regulated should introduce limits on what content people are allowed access.

For instance we see that recently britain has taken steps to limit people's access to pornography and we think that that's the kind of thing we're debating about here.

Not a sort of chinese system wherein people don't have access to most of the internet, but one in which the government filters certain content and I think the debate comes down to what that content ought to be.

Our first argument is about limiting access to obscene material.

Now I'm not going to defend the conservative ban in britain of pornographic material, but I do think that everyone can agree that things like child pornography shouldn't be accessible in any country.

I think that you can use internet censorship to make it more difficult for people to, one, access, and two, distribute child pornography.

In doing so, you also reduce the incentives for its creation.

Which means that you can reduce the amount of child abuse going on within and without your country.

We think that this is obviously a huge end and that even if you lose out on some legitimate content, the benefits that accrue by limiting child abuse greatly outweigh them so we're willing to bite that harm.

Our second argument is about radicalism online.

We see that since the early days of the internet, radical groups have used it to recruit members.

Whether that be al qaeda in the early two thousands, isis in recent years, or now the alt right and neo-nazis in america and europe today.

Isis for instance has used twitter as one of their main resources to get young men in europe to join their cause.

Attackers in france, belgium, and britain have all been found to be radicalized online.

We think that at that point, when certain material online poses a real threat to the safety of a nation, that it is acceptable to censor access to radical islamic materials.

If fewer young men had access to these materials, then fewer would become terrorists because this is the means by which they are being radicalized.

So we think that this is ultimately a tool to fight against terrorism.

But moreover, the alt right has used the internet as a way to legitimize their narrative about white supremacy, racism, and bigotry.

Because the internet acts as an amplifying chamber wherein a few, hardcore, neo-nazi types can seem much more popular than they are.

This draws people in to think that their message is normal and ultimately makes more people think that this kind of discourse is acceptable even though it isn't.

At the end of the day we think that it's worth it to censor access to this type of material so that people don't think that being a fascist is acceptable nowadays, when in fact of course it isn't.

And that the harms that these alt righters pose to democracy, ultimately makes it acceptable for the state to take extreme action, like censoring the internet.

Our third and final argument is perhaps a little less important than those but still matters to some people, namely private property violations on the internet.

Now many people are not sympathetic to the big hollywood movie studios and the big record companies who are losing money due to piracy, but remember that this also affects artists and independent labels and indie film houses as well.

At the end of the day, piracy has greatly reduced the profitability of music and film.

There's much less incentive to produce music and film, especially to take risks on new genres or new artists, if you know that the amount of profit you receive is going to be much lower than it was twenty years ago before widespread piracy.

We think that this disproportionately harms groups that haven't had access to the media production in the past.

That it's less likely that we'll see types of media targeting new groups or groups that pirate more often, such as low income people, because there's no money to be made if everyone just gets everything on the pirate bay.

So we think that it would be acceptable to censor websites like the pirate bay if it means that more people are consuming media legitimately.

For all of these reasons we think that we should increase internet censorship.

Thank you.

"
"daniel_3184_internet-censorship_pro_opening","3184","PRO","daniel","","We should increase internet censorship because it will be beneficial in suppressing dangerous ideologies and essential in suppressing abuse, harassment and bullying.

So let's start by talking about why it's invaluable to suppressing abuse and bullying and harassment.

And I think that these kinds of things are incredibly common on the internet especially because you can post anonymously, and a lot of these things don't get traced back to you.

You see hordes of internet trolls, you see people trying to leak private parts of people's identity, you see people bullying people online.

You see people making threats against people's safety, their family and their own safety online, and these kinds of things are incredibly bad.

And the idea, like, the main idea for why censorship is bad is because you don't want to suppress discourse.

But obviously bullying and harassment, besides just being affront to individual people's dignity, is also going to suppress discourse because, like, if I'm afraid of if I'm afraid of like a bunch of trump trolls, like doing very bad things, threatening me, leaking my identity, I'm not going to express my views on the internet, critiquing them on twitter if I'm worried that it's going to set off like like a whole like a whole big thing.

So I think that in a lot of ways this leads to it can lead to great harms to people, but it also can suppress discourse anyway, if you just suppress discourse in the right way.

And I think that this is also true with respect to possibly getting dangerous ideologies out.

And this is important because the internet's a useful platform in giving a lot of unsavory individuals a community to coalesce around.

You can have places like like four chan, have like a lot of unsavory elements to it.

I hear there's five chan nowadays, which is for the people who I guess weren't who didn't like four chan enough.

They wanted something even less savory.

There's whole lots of internet forums like that, or more commonly I guess is reddit, where people post all kinds of things, all kinds of content, and it's essentially a breeding ground for a lot of things, like alt-right, white supremacy groups, other kinds of things like that which are oftentimes used to target vulnerable people in society in really bad ways.

And I think that censoring the internet is important to actually suppressing these kinds of things.

So the final thing they I would therefore talk about is why I think that censorship is going to happen in the correct way.

And I think that the reason why it would happen in the correct way is because right now we have a great default to other than in the most extreme of extreme cases, just about anything on the internet goes.

And even if something on the internet is bad per se, since it's so difficult to regulate it, since we don't put a lot of resources into some kinds of internet monitoring, for things other than like terrorism and like crimes I guess, but we don't look at so much as regulating it as a modicum of discourse.

That's like a big problem because a whole lot of our discourse as a society happens on the internet nowadays and when we don't regulate it the right way, I think that what it results in a lot of these unsavory elements bubbling up.

And the big thing is that I feel like there's a natural check against this in that if you try to check reasonable people or if you try to check people who have more like reasonable political views, there would be a whole lot of backlash on that.

Most places have legal protection on those kinds of things.

I really don't see this being all that successful unless you're talking about people who are truly abusing their position or using it to hurt other people and silence silence other people.

So for those reasons, increase internet censorship.

"
"tim_3186_flat-tax_con_opening_rachel","3186","CON","tim","rachel","We should not introduce a flat tax.

Our argument is essentially going to come in two parts, the first part is that a flat tax is inherently a a regressive tax based on the system of taxation and the system of capitalism that we live in, and the second argument and the second prong is essentially why a regressive tax is always going to be bad.

Alright so let's talk about why flat tax is regressive.

A flat tax means that everyone is paying a roughly equal percentage of their income to the governmemt.

What this means is that when you have a lower income you spend you're giving up an equal percentage of your income no matter how much more money someone else's making.

But when you have a lower income each dollar is is much more valuable than any single dollar that someone who is more wealthy has and the reason for this is that when you're making say twenty thousand dollars a year, you're living near the poverty line.

You're living with very little room left to function before taxes are even taken into account.

But if you're living off say two million dollars a year, you're so dramatically above the poverty line, that most of those millions of dollars are not necessary in order for you to live in a comfortable environment, to live a comfortable life in which all of your needs are being met.

The problem is when you have this so called flat tax, that person that's making twenty thousand dollars a year say that tax is twenty five percent that person making twenty thousand dollars a year now only has fifteen thousand dollars to live off of below the poverty line and again those five thousand dollars are much more important than the five hundred thousand dollars that that person who is making two million dollars is giving up.

And while it may sound ridiculous to say that it's more onerous on the person that's giving up five thousand dollars to the government than it is to the person that's giving up five hundred thousand dollars to the government, we would say that the difference in disposable income illustrates that a flat percentage is in is more regressive because of the impact that it has.

Because you have much less disposable income at your disposal in order to use to feed yourself and to take care of yourself and because of this we would say that based on the impact that that tax has any sort of a flat tax is going to have a regressive impact even if you're paying the same percentage.

But that impact is what really matters in the day-to-day lives of people that are paying these taxes as opposed to what percentage of their income they're losing because that impact is what affects whether or not they can afford to feed their children, whether or not they can afford to live in their homes, these types of things that have real world devastating impact.

So why is a regressive tax bad?

We think a regressive tax could only be just if people who are worse off use more government resources, but this is simply a myth.

It sounds true in theory but it's not.

While yes people that are more that are worse off get things like welfare, government infrastructure, market protections and national defense are ultimately more important to those who are wealthy because they profit off of things like those markets and those structures in ways that those who are poor do not.

For example, if you have a business in which you sell copious amounts of goods on the market, those market protections are far much more valuable to you than any sort of welfare that anyone who is poor is getting.

We think you create a system where you need to spend more on welfare to support those whose money you're taking away at a higher clip anyway and this means that new tax revenue ends up being expended on the people that you're taking the money from anyway.

We think that that impact based taxes are better and therefore using a progressive percentage rather than a flat tax is more preferential because it means people are paying based on what they can afford and based on what they use not just on some sort of percentage that someone sets arbitrarily.

For these reasons we should not introduce a flat tax.

"
"sam_3186_flat-tax_con_opening_tim","3186","CON","sam","tim","I stand in firm opposition to the motion, we should introduce a flat tax.

I'm going to break this speech into three parts: firsts, I'm going to discuss the morality of a flat, versus progressive tax, then discuss why progressive taxation is the most utile way to do it, and then thirdly, discuss why customisation is key when it comes to taxes.

First off on morals.

While tim may claim that the wealthy have the only claim to their property, and the government has no right to take that money away, we would fundamentally disagree.

First we don't think a strong link between individuals humanity, and the property that they control, was actually created.

Instead, we think government action and taxes by extension are simply about utility, and that taking property away from individuals is a tradition, that has existed throughout history, and is again fundamental to the construction of any functioning government, and is always essential to helping the most marginalized within a particular community.

Additionally, we would say that the wealthiest got their power on the backs of the poor.

Individuals who are still making a large amount of money employ, typically, huge amounts of poor workers, and depend on poor and middle class individuals to buy their goods, therein creates a reciprocal obligation to pay back the suffering people, who you have manipulated and profited from.

Additionally, individuals who got their money from a historical fund, who whose family has had money going back, typically made their money by stealing, or further oppressing marginalized peoples, and pushing people into poverty.

It is unclear why donald trump, coming from a millionaire family, deserves all this money, when it came on the back of poor individuals, who were pushed out of society, and were essentially pushed into the cycle of poverty, in order to push their family up.

Additionally though, we would say that the claim to property has nothing to do with humanity, is based on, instead on utility.

The reason we don't take everyone's property away, the reason we don't steal people's goods, or take their homes away, and redistribute them evenly, is because we believe that it would lead to less utile outcomes.

If it were possible to evenly distribute all goods, in all situations, and then still have a functioning and profitable society, still have good foreign direct investment, we would do so.

It's simply that this is the most effective, and and pragmatic way to actually do taxes.

Finally, we would say that the rich actually use tax money the most.

Just look at the owner of walmart, the average employee is is on food stamps.

A proportion of their living wage comes from the sort of tax revenue, and as such the rich use it to push themselves in power.

They also use roads the most, because they have the most transportation uses, they ship goods, and largely get the benefit of some of the most effective school systems, through the money that they pay.

Now, going to my substantive material.

We believe progressive taxes are the most utile, because the poorest people have the greatest marginal value of a dollar.

This also extends to the marginal value of a percentage of their income.

If a rich person loses ten percent of their income, they can't buy more caviar, or more fancy food, when a poor person loses a huge percentage of their income, they cannot survive, they cannot buy food, shelter, or basic living conditions.

They can't pay for internet transportation, which is essential for many jobs in twenty first century.

At the point where people will starve, through a flat tax, it is unjust.

Now the second point of substantive material, is that customization is key.

As tim says, the role of government is to incentivize particular action, and to maximize utility.

The ability to have a progressive, and somewhat complicated tax system, allows the government to disincentivize particular action, or otherwise levy fees on individuals who benefit the most from taxes, which as we said, where the wealthiest people.

As such, we believe that we should not introduce a flat tax.

"
"rachel_3186_flat-tax_pro_opening","3186","PRO","rachel","","The motion for today's debate is that we should introduce a flat tax.

What this means is that in the united states where we currently tout a progressive tax the majority of the time we would instead institute we would replace that tax with only a flat tax which would take the same percentage of income from everyone regardless of how high their income is.

So someone who was earning a hundred thousand dollars a year would still pay more in taxes than someone earning only forty thousand but only because of the percentage not because the percentage goes up as you pay as you as you earn more.

Three main areas of clash, first on the principle of fairness in this situation.

We think that at the end of the day, wages are meant to evaluate the labor that you put in and different forms of labor are worth different amount not even due to an objective metric but rather because of the way that society values that, making this actually one of the most democratic systems that currently exists.

It basically says that because that we take all these criteria, how much energy you put into something: how much schooling you had to go through, how much that schooling maybe cost.

And we say this is the metric by which we evaluate how many how much your wages are and we think this is like the market is a pretty is does like a pretty good job of this insofar as clearly people are still willing to go into any number of positions regardless of their wages, it just changes the barriers in between.

So we think that doctors make more than fry cooks because society values the effort that both jobs require and how much of an energy commitment they are and decided that being a doctor deserves more compensation.

Given that we understand that we think that how much each career makes influences then how like what those people choose to put into it, so we think that everyone has access to the information that a doctor makes more than a fry cook and given this they make an educated decision based on this knowledge in combination with their knowledge of how much education they might need etcetera etcetera and become either a doctor or a fry cook.

So given that you need to so given the end of that whatever you earn is in exchange for your labor, it becomes the property of that individual who earned it.

Taxes regardless of what kind they are are a state are a form of state supported theft but given that you need some tax for public good that everyone agrees is necessary like roads are something that everyone needs etcetera we think that it's fundamentally unjust to steal more from some people on the basis of their income and that you need to promote a hard line when it comes to state sponsored thefts as to what is justified and what is not.

So we think that it's only fair if it's the same percentage from each person given that that way you're stealing the same percentage from each person.

Our second area of clash is about encouraging innovation.

We think that getting more money is an incentive for people to exert themselves more than they are necessarily comfortable exerting themselves and a progressive tax removes the incentive because it reduces the margin of difference in economic growth.

It makes the trade off of time for money harder to justify if the money is marginal in terms of its increase.

We need but we need people to have an incentive to work harder in order to achieve greater efficiency like at the end of the day we need someone to serve as the manager or the boss or the director and if the extra hours that they spend in the professional arena does not justify the amount of money that they earn because the progressive tax takes off so much of their raise, then we're just not going to have anyone who's willing to become those because everyone loves maximizing the time they spend at home or relaxing.

But we also think this is really important in terms of maximizing peoples' incentives to create and to innovate like physically.

We think the reason we have the majority of the great inventions in the world have to do with because we like respect patents and respect intellectual property.

Our third area of clash is just on why it maximizes efficiency.

We think that it gets rid of having to file for taxes, no dividends, no IRS rules to comply with, which just makes the entire tax process a lot easier.

For these reasons, proud to propose.

"
"tim_3186_flat-tax_pro_opening","3186","PRO","tim","","We should introduce a flat tax.

In the status quo the majority of income taxes in western liberal democracies are progressive taxes that disproportionately tax wealthy earners and take their money even though they are the people that are least likely to take government services.

For this reason we would propose that the states or that states introduce an income tax that is a flat tax that ensures that all people that are capable of paying taxes were not going to eliminate a minimum earnings limit that allows you to have a taxable income because we think that certain people simply cannot pay taxes because of the situation they're in.

But in instances in which people can afford to pay taxes, all people have to pay the same proportion of their income into the government.

So we think that it's essential that this occurs because recognize that all individuals are exist under a coercive apparatus of the state.

No matter how wealthy one is or how poor one is, all people have been forced into the state by circumstances of where they were born or because of where they had to go to live for jobs or other types of social reasons.

No one entirely freely chooses to be within the state, and even if they did the state cannot simply, because of consent, choose to abuse its people.

The state can only be justified, can only exist in a just way, if it serves to benefit all of its people.

This means that the state has an equal burden to all citizens, even if certain citizens, through their own free power and capabilities, are able to earn more within the state apparatus then other individuals.

What we think this means is that when you have other systems of taxation such as a progressive tax, you choose to ignore the claims of representation that certain members of your constituency have.

And it means that you're saying that the freedom of property the freedom to accumulate property and accumulate wealth is different once you get richer.

It says that the humanity and the claims you have to ownership are diluted when you are a more wealthy human being.

And it's more important to recognize that the vast majority of wealthy individuals in western liberal democracies are not individuals that are taking the types of social benefits that taxes go to pay.

They pay into certain things that they're simply never going to use.

Things like welfare benefits, things like social security, these are things that wealthy individuals are forced to pay into but gain little benefit from.

Yes, it's true that these individuals gain benefit from infrastructure, protection from the army, all these things just as everyone else does, but it is the case that these individuals simply are not getting as much out of the government directly as poor individuals are.

What this means is that it is unfair, principally, to force these people to pay more and that when you have progressive taxes it allows for drastic spending to take place because it because constituencies and a base of people in the public know that they will not be the ones that have to bear the burden, the spending burden, that increased government spending costs.

We think that if you're going to institute no new government programs if you're going to place more coercive power into state hands, if you're going to ensure that the state is more capable of taking from the people within the state and stealing the property that they have earned, it is important that all people bear the ramifications of this equally.

Yes it is the case that less less wealthy individuals have less disposable income at their at their disposal but this doesn't mean that their claims to ownership change because of the quantity of ownership that you have.

Rather claims of ownership matter because of the importance of valuing property in a broad and principled manner.

We think that flat taxes to the best job of representing that and flat taxes do the best job of ensuring that not only do all people bear the same burden, but all people are given the same level of right to property as anyone else.

In the status quo there's a system that allows spending to run wild in the government level with the burden being pushed dramatically on a small segment of society.

That burden isn't fair given the responsibility the state has to all citizens and the conception that the state serves to serve exists to serve all.

Given this we should introduce a flat tax.

"daniel_3191_recall-elections_con_opening_tim","3191","CON","daniel","tim","We should not introduce recall elections because recall elections are only going to make politics more inefficient less effective and ultimately therefore less accountable to the actual or less representative of the actual will of the people.

So first let's start by saying that in extreme circumstances of misconduct or if there is extreme wrongdoing you usually have alternative mechanisms anyway.

You can have impeachment.

You can take actual charges against someone so if someone is if a political figure is guilty of corruption or misdemeanor or some other kind of misconduct there's alternates you can take if they actually do severe action.

Usually recall elections just happen because they do something you don't like and they do it on a sufficient enough scale that you really don't like it or you do it because you can get away with it and it mucks up someone's agenda.

So let's break down what this will look like.

Generally when you win an election with the majority of the people you have a mandate to enact your agenda because the people have spoken and the people want something so you should give it to them.

Because that's the way democracy is supposed to work.

The way democracy isn't supposed to work is that if somebody wins the majority of a election or the like, now obviously an opposition can and should keep fighting but one thing that they shouldn't do is that when you keep trying to trigger a recall election what you're likely going to do is make it so that it's not actually focusing on the issues as much as you're focusing on the continued reelection of somebody.

So you're not actually really going to let someone who was democratically elected enact their agenda because it becomes rather difficult to do things when you're running for election oftentimes.

But additionally I also think that recall elections are less representative because when you have like a major election you tend to get more turn out people plan for it people can it's easier to get time off from work maybe.

You're more aware of it because it comes at similar times on predetermined intervals.

But a special elections tend to have lower turnout which means that you're likely going to get a less representative result anyway which isn't really all that fair and that's very bad.

And most likely the results aren't going to change all that much and even if the results do change then what you've done is you've hijacked the agenda likely over something that's rather unimportant and therefore it's going to be a big impediment to actually enacting your agenda.

But further I ultimately think that this is a quite bad way to conduct politics because recall election just result in a further fueling of animosity .

It further contributes to the seemingly constant election atmosphere the constant adversarial atmosphere where constantly trying to get the other party out of power in every way possible and that's obviously not very good or conducive to solution solving problem solving which is bad because there's a lot of problems that do need to be solved that aren't getting solved.

So for those reasons we should not introduce recall elections.

"
"tim_3191_recall-elections_con_opening_james","3191","CON","tim","james","We should not introduce recall elections.

So, we think that the problem with recall elections broadly is that they allow for people to remove individuals from political office, when politics is is essentially and apparently a long game.

What we mean by this is that it's very difficult to gauge political decisions in the short term, because the ramifications often appear in the long term, and it's very difficult for people to internalize those things, for example when congress chooses to pass one budget over another, it's hard to internalize, and to see the ramifications of those minute differences, or sometimes very drastic differences, for a number for a very long period of time, because bureaucracy change the amount of time that people are able to adopt certain policies, there's there's a a wide variety of metrics that could be at play, and therefore we think it's irresponsible for voters to remove someone from political office in the middle of their term.

We think it simply is not fair.

We think that people have immensely limited information, generally, and that politicians often have vastly more information than individuals do, especially in regards to interests that concern national security, particular legal interests, or business interests, we think these are instances, in which individuals or the public at large is very bad at making decisions, and that we shouldn't trust our politicians to make these decisions for us.

We think that recall elections lead to a number of very bad scenarios.

The first is that we think there's immense pressure to appeal to populists, because populists are often the people that vote in niche election, so non presidential elections, and if there was to be a recall election, populists and popular supporters, the most fervent supporters and in a district, the most fervent advocates, are likely to be the ones that end up going to that recall election, and therefore politicians need to be cognizant of those people, and play to their interests, even when information goes against the interests of those individuals, because those individuals are just like everyone else in society, and are not privy to the special information that politicians do.

We think this makes it impossible we think that it means that politicians are more likely to be on a tight leash, and it makes them less likely to do a couple of things: first, it's less likely to let them go against their party, and we think given the immense amount of partisan gridlock, that exists in our current political systems, it would be preferable if politicians didn't fear backlash from their party, especially in a recall election.

Second, we think it's less likely that individuals are likely to introduce controversial but important bills, because whereas certain times whereas in the status quo, bills can be passed and play out over a long period of time, and you can see the ramifications to ramifications of those bills, that same amount of time isn't given to people, when you have recall elections, as a threat to repeal those people from office.

Look, we think that politicians deserve the opportunity to to fill out their time in office.

Look at someone like president obama: in the early term of president obama, in his first term, approval for president obama was fairly low, below fifty percent, individuals didn't think that he was able to accomplish much, and he seemed kind of trapped by his by his healthcare policy, and not much more of significant accomplishment.

Then he went on to do things, like be crucial in the paris climate accord, in passing the iran deal, and his popularity skyrocketed, because individuals were able to see how his policies played out.

They're able to see the immense unprecedented streak of job growth and job creation, that came after obama's stimulus, something that simply was not visible to individuals a you know, a number of months, six months, a year out from when that policy was passed.

And we think that recall elections damage the the integrity of the political system, as it currently exists.

And for those reasons, we should not introduce recall elections.

"
"james_3191_recall-elections_pro_opening","3191","PRO","james","","We should introduce recall elections.

So in some US states, for instance, if people living in that state think the governor is doing a poor job, they can hold a referendum, and everyone votes on whether or not they want to keep the governor or recall him and then elect a new governor.

We think that pretty much every liberal democracy should introduce similar policies.

We've seen this take place in US states, like wisconsin, in recent years.

Two arguments.

The first is about accountability for politicians.

Right now, politicians talk a good talk during elections.

They say that they're going to do things that the people actually care about.

Then they get into office and suddenly they're able to start filling their pockets, and helping out their friends, and listening to big business interests, and basically ignore people until six months before the next election.

There's no accountability for what you do except for the immediate period right before an election.

Because people, generally speaking, have to think about more recent information rather than something you did two years ago.

But what this means is that if we implemented recall elections, you could remove politicians as they did bad things.

Ultimately, we think this has tremendous impacts for a few reasons.

One, it changes the decision-making of politicians up front.

It's now harder to go into politics simply to fill your own pockets or to make money for your friends, so we think that fewer bad people, basically, are going to be willing to go into politics.

But secondly, we also think that it gives you more of an incentive to run on honest policies.

Candidates will have less of an incentive to oversell themselves or to promise things that they can't deliver if they know that they might be removed for failing to fulfill campaign promises.

And thirdly, we think it's much more likely that the politicians who run will actually reflect the will of the constituents, that you'll have support for things like social welfare or policies that ordinary people in their districts want.

The other team might try to tell you that this means politicians will change constantly in order to try to react to the latest polling data, but I don't see why this is necessarily bad.

We think politicians should react to what the people want, even outside of an election year.

It doesn't make much sense to me that simply because you win an election in two thousand sixteen, you should have a mandate to do whatever you want until twenty twenty four.

Circumstances in the world change.

Why shouldn't your governments have to as well?

We can hold people accountable, we can make them be honest, and we think that ultimately this leads to a healthier democracy.

Which leads nicely into our second major argument about democratic engagement.

Right now, if you live in a liberal country, there's really no reason to be engaged in politics between election years.

Nobody really cares about protesters, so you don't have any way to change anything in government if you don't like the way things are going.

You can write to your congressman and things like that, but they don't have any reason to listen to you because they know that ultimately, as long as they're a little better than the other guy during election year, that they don't have anything to worry about.

But if you have the ability to have recall elections, then suddenly it makes sense for people to be engaged throughout their lives rather than only every few years when there's an election.

If people are thinking about whether or not they want to recall a politician, then they need to inform themselves on the issues.

So you create more of an incentive for people to be informed.

But on top of that, you create an incentive for people to contact their elected officials, to think about who else could be governing them.

And we think that this means that people will be more democratically engaged.

A democracy really only works if people are voting, if people are thinking about the issues, that people care and feel like they have a voice.

It's a big problem right now and a reason why there's such low voter turnout in the west, that people don't think they have a voice.

They don't think their vote matters.

We think that we shift that kind of decision-making on our side by encouraging people to participate in electoral politics and in democracy in between election years so that it matters much more to their ordinary day-to-day lives.

So because of accountability and because of democratic engagement, we should introduce recall elections.

Thank you.

"
"tim_3191_recall-elections_pro_opening","3191","PRO","tim","","We should introduce recall elections.

So, to begin, we're going to give a model of how we think this would look, and then we're going to explain the principle that this is based on, before explaining how the pragmatic benefits would accumulate, if we introduced recall elections.

Okay, so, we think that recall elections are generally going to take place at the state level, we don't think that it is feasible to have a national recall election, but at least at the state level, we think it would be initiated via a petition of twenty percent of registered voters in the area of the representative.

So, what this means is that if some state if constituents of that person want to recall them, they would need to get a petition of twenty percent of the population that is registered to vote.

Which means that, if you're child, you couldn't sign this petition, if you're not registered to vote you couldn't sign this petition, and this is so that you ensure that those that have a stake in the election are those that can have a stake in the recall.

Okay, so we think that the principle behind this is very simple: we think that democracy, while it is certainly flawed, is the best way to aggregate the preferences of the people.

We think that term lengths are, in and of themselves, arbitrary, and that allowing recall elections, allows for people not to be bound by these terms lengths.

We think that this is incredibly important, because oftentimes these term lengths ensure that individuals that become incredibly unpopular, elected officials with approval ratings below thirty percent, below forty percent, people that simply don't have the trust of the public, continue to stay in office.

We think that this is problematic, and while in some instances, we think that there may be a misuse of judgment, by those that are recalling the person, in the vast majority of instances, we think when people would be recalled, these are legitimate instances, in which that person is failing in their role as a as a representative of the people, because they no longer represent the popular will of those that elected them.

So, we think that there are some massive pragmatic gains that come from this, in instances where there could be a recall.

First, we think that there are instances in which elected officials are corrupt, and what this means is that when you recall these people, you ensure that you're moving corrupt officials from office, and these are often instances in which there isn't enough evidence that this person would go to jail, or a legal process would be much longer than a recall process.

We think that recall can ensure that corrupt officials are removed from office, which is crucial to avoid an abuse of power.

We also think that the potential of recall always holds elected officials to the fire.

Means that, you know that you're not safe, and you're not bound to your term, but rather if you are doing a poor job, if you're acting in a way in which individuals, that you are representing, do not approve of what you're doing, you can be removed from office.

And this is important, because oftentimes elected officials will behave in ways that go against their constituents, but because the the public memory is a very short term thing, what this results is people shifting their position, once an election becomes closer, and these individuals end up winning reelection.

But, we think that this only involves a cycle of abuse, in which people are able to abuse the fact, that the public is not able to be constantly vigilant, and constantly aware, and they're not able to recall.

What this means is that, if you have recall elections for the entirety of the term, people are more likely to be representative of their constituents, rather than them shifting to be representative when it comes time to have an election again.

We simply think that a direct democracy leads to a more satisfied constituency, it leads to a voting body that is more likely to be happy with the actions of their elected officials, and it ensures that in those cases, in which those elected officials have clearly failed to represent their people, the people that voted them into office, we think that recall elections are invaluable tool.

And for these reasons, we should introduce recall elections.

"
"rachel_3192_compulsory-voting_con_opening_daniel","3192","CON","rachel","daniel","Every time we have a debate about compulsory voting, the the question is always: do we care about the quantity of the votes that come in or do we care about the quality and the thought that people put behind those votes?

This is the central question in this round because, in the end, you can mandate for people to come to the voting booth, but you cannot mandate for them to spend hours researching the candidate or to make sure that they know what they're talking about.

In the end, those who didn't have time before are unlikely to have time now, and so what you're actually creating is a world in which hundreds of people come in, throw a random name into the ballot box, and leave.

Two main areas of clash, the first on why it is unjust to mandate compulsorily compulsory voting.

If it is a right to vote, it should also be a right not to.

This is because a central tenet of democracy is the freedom of an individual to be autonomous and live life as they desire.

As such, it might be preferable if everyone voted, but it is undemocratic to force everyone to vote.

Moreover, we think that it is wrong to make something a legal requirement which we know will unevenly discriminate among the population.

In the same way that there's massive opposition to stop and frisk policies because they are used in a racist and biased way, we think that requiring compulsory voting is the same thing.

Insofar as lowest voter turnout occurs mostly among those in poverty and very often among people of color, who have been forced into poverty by society, we think that when you then say, "" if you don't show up, we're going to fine you, even though we stuck you in the same situation, "" is completely unjustified and actively discriminatory.

We also want to talk about political speech, because we think that not casting your vote is often a political statement in itself.

If turnout is low, it indicates that none of the candidates were preferable, that they weren't engaging, and that they didn't engage the the like democratic process.

It's then a political statement in itself to say that, "" look, I'm not voting because there isn't a good option for me, because I don't think they're representative of my views. ""

Insofar as this is, in its way, a like an act of political speech, like a statement of saying, "" I do not believe in either of these candidates, "" we think it also ought be protected as such.

We think that this is then legitimate, even if not all of them are being political.

As we see, like people are protected in wearing political clothing, although not everyone is making a statement by spouting a big large gun on the front of their shirt or naked women.

Our second area of clash is about being pragmatically problematic.

We don't think, as danny thinks, that you're actually going to change the incentives of politicians, because in the end, those who are going to be voting more now are those who are lower down in society and don't have as much money.

This means larger politicians do not care about them and honestly would still prefer for them to have a difficult time getting to the vote, because who cares if they get fined, they just don't want them voting against them.

So, at the point that they're like not actually creating a meaningful base for politicians, all you're actually creating on their side of the house is a world in which you're going to have a lot more attack ads and a lot more flash campaigning, because now they're going to be directly advertising to people who don't have much time to research.

So a lot more of he he said she said, look how much prettier I am than my candidate.

Like we think that a lot of the time candidates like trump grow because people just only see the social media presence rather than doing the research with regards to their politics, and I think that's actually what you're creating.

Because their side of the house doesn't actually create time bubbles where single mothers can suddenly spend time researching political candidates, rather just says, "" go and do it, "" you're much more likely to have decisions that are based on snippets.

We also think that fines for those who don't go in further disengage them from the political process and create a financial strain.

Basically it's saying: you're already struggling, let me as like the proxy government make you struggle even more.

This is the best way for them to say, "" I don't care about this government.

Not only is it not representing me, but it is actively harming me and forcing me into uncomfortable situations that take away from my life.""

But at the end of the day, the candidate is still not going to be representative, even with compulsory voting, because people aren't truly voting for who they believe in.

They're just trying to get out of it.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"
"hayah_3192_compulsory-voting_con_opening_james","3192","CON","hayah","james","The government's speech boils down to the fact that they want to change the incentives of political parties and have them appeal to new people, and they want to solve voter apathy.

The problem is they don't really do either of those things.

And the other problem, ladies and gentleman, with this issue of like: "" let's change the incentives of political parties "" what a silly way to solve this problem.

Right?

They say to themselves: "" how can we get rich white guys to be more appealing to young poor black guys? ""

Well here's a better question: why don't we, instead of getting the rich white guys to be more appealing, why don't we just get more young poor black guys involved in politics?

Right?

That would be a much more, that would be a much better and more real change that can and should be meeting countries like the united states.

So for example, policy changes that would make it easier for poor people to run for elections.

Right?

By doing things like limiting the amounts of money you can spend on your campaign.

That would be of real change in politics that would allow real people who actually care about these issues to run and make the changes, and have more people involved in politics and actually get interested in politics and get people excited about politics again, as opposed to just saying like: "" hey let's get this rich old white guy "" like the same political figures to like turn to these new populations.

Which we don't think that they're going to do anyways, for a number of reasons.

Not least of which is the electoral college system in the united states which is going to lead to a backlash about this policy and people being very upset about this policy, but no actual change in in like who politicians are turning to, because they know where their voter base is.

They know where they tend to win, they know where the votes are.

Then we heard this idea of like voter apathy.

Right?

We're going to solve it.

You don't solve voter apathy by by threatening somebody with a fine or jail time.

Right?

That's not how you solve voter apathy.

You're not more likely to get involved in politics for threatened with a fine or jail time, you're just more likely to go stick any ballot in the box.

Right?

You go grab the first one that you see.

Or, even more likely or and even worse, is you're going to and you're gonna see a lot more novelty voting.

Right?

People who write jed bartlet for president on their ballot, are people who stuff fifteen ballots into their, into their envelope, or people who put in blank ballots, or people who put in ballots for the party that they think has the funniest name or the funniest platform.

So in countries that have a multi-party system, for example israel, you're going to get a lot of votes for for novelty parties such as the green party, whose entire platform is based on promoting the legalization of marijuana.

Not that there's anything wrong with that being a party platform or being a policy platform or or being a policy that people believe in, but when you get but when you force people to vote and you get huge swaths of the population who think that it's a big joke, or who are angry at the government for forcing them to go and vote, you're gonna get a lot of votes like that which doesn't necessarily reflect the true will of the people either.

So I think that you get disproportionate power for small for small interest groups rather than a better representative government.

More than that, ladies and gentlemen, we think that you violate the freedom of speech by compelling people to speak.

We think that you have a right to vote but not a duty to vote and we think that that's a big difference.

Right?

You can choose to vote you can choose not to vote.

And the fact is, ladies and gentleman, that the non vote should be enough of a vote for us.

It gives us a lot of information.

It gives the governing parties a lot of information.

It means anybody who truly cares about changing the country that they live in, who truly cares about politics will look to those people and say: "" why aren't they voting? ""

Right?

When you had barack obama, for example, who when he ran for president, you did get a lot of people who in the past it and vote, and he appealed to them.

He cared about them and he looked at the people who weren't voting and said I want to appeal to them.

We think that that's a a good idea.

We think that the information that you get from having a non vote from every election being told this is the number of people who just didn't care enough to go out to the to the polls.

We think that that information is crucial and valuable to the government.

Its people telling them that they want to change the political system.

For example, change it away from the electoral college, where people feel that the votes are being wasted.

We think that it tells people that they're disillusioned with politics and that they need to change their ways.

We think that there are better ways to solve the problem of apathy rather than this.

Thank you.

"
"james_3192_compulsory-voting_pro_opening","3192","PRO","james","","We should introduce compulsory voting.

So what we're going to argue for you this evening is that countries like the united states or canada which do not have compulsory voting right now, should adopt a system similar to what they have in australia, whereby people have to go to the polls on election day and turn in a ballot.

People are free to turn in a blank ballot, or write gandolf or darth vader on their ballot if they want to, but everyone has to go to the polls and vote on election day.

So three reasons why we think this policy should be implemented in countries that don't have it yet.

First we think this changes the incentives of political parties in a very positive way.

Right now, there's a huge incentive for political parties to appeal to the populations that actually go out and vote.

After all it doesn't matter if you command a huge lead with people who don't go to the polls on election day.

What does this look like?

It means that older people and wealthier people who are more likely to be able to go to the polls or to choose to go vote, are much more likely to have political parties cater to them.

So the interests of wealthy elderly people, particularly white people in countries like the US and canada, are disproportionately influential in our democracy.

We think that if you introduced compulsory voting, parties would now have more of an incentive to appeal to other groups in society as well.

In other words, suddenly it matters what young black people in chicago think because they're out at the polls in as great a numbers as old white people.

At the end of the day, we think that this is important because it means that parties want to appeal to more people so they will implement policies that actually help a broader portion of society than what we see right now when they try to appeal only to a narrow section of society who actually go out to vote.

Our second argument is that this would lead to better participatory democracy.

So what we mean by this is that right now there is a tremendous amount of apathy in many western countries.

In the united states' midterm elections, ones between presidential elections that is to say, often have voter turnout well below fifty percent.

In britain, voter turnout is rarely over sixty.

On the other hand in brazil or australia, obviously voter turnout is close to one hundred percent.

What this means is that there is a greater culture in those countries of participating in elections.

Many people in america or similar countries, never vote in their lives.

They don't feel any connection to their country's democracy.

This means that they're less likely to try to stay informed about the issues, less likely to know who their politicians and leaders are, and generally less likely to participate in civic society.

We think that for democracy to be successful, people must have an incentive to participate and that compulsory voting is the best possible incentive.

And our third argument is that we would have a more representative government.

Right now we see that governments as I mentioned earlier reflect the interests of a relatively narrow scope of people.

But now I want to talk about what it actually looks like when you have a government that represents everyone.

I think it is much more likely that governments would focus on social policy, on helping low income people, on helping immigrant families and the like, if we had compulsory voting.

This is true because right now the government actually doesn't represent the american, canadian, british, whatever country you choose, doesn't represent their people.

It represents the voting population.

But when you make it so that everyone is the voting population, suddenly the state must actually care about what is good for everyone.

At that point we think it's much more likely that you get policies which are tailored to the general interest than those which are tailored to certain special interest groups which vote disproportionately.

So for these reasons, we should implement compulsory voting in countries that do not already do so.

Thank you.

"
"daniel_3192_compulsory-voting_pro_opening","3192","PRO","daniel","","We should introduce compulsory voting, because turnout is one of the absolute most important things in a democratic society, and, I think compulsory voting is going to increase turnout.

So, let's start by talking about the problem of turnout.

One of the biggest problems plaguing a lot of democratic societies is a lack of participation.

So, when you look at a place like the united states, you can only more or less expect like fifty to sixty percent of people participating, I believe, in most in a presidential election.

In mid term elections, or local elections, numbers are often even lower, and a whole lot of people aren't participating.

And additionally, in a lot of countries around the world , this is a similar problem, like I believe participation in the the UK prime minister election that took place a couple of days ago, I believe participation hovered in, like, somewhere in the sixties, and it historically high turnout.

So, the problem with this is, that when you have numbers like that, you're a democracy, but it seems like a huge portion, like millions of people, aren't participating in the process.

And, even if they're not participating in the process, in order for the state to be just, it still has to obey the will of the people, and it's therefore important to make sure that, it's as easy for people to participate as possible.

I think compulsory voting makes it more likely that people are going to participate, in two ways.

First and foremost, people don't want to get fined, people don't want to face the possibility of minor levels of punishment, and people just like don't want to deal with that.

So, people are probably going to vote to avoid that.

But moreover, when voting is seen as something that is, like, your civic duty, rather than something as that you're obligated to do, it gives people more latitude to suppress votes in some ways in line with political incentives.

So, when you look at places like america, it's easier to have your elections on a work day, where it's hard for some people to get off from work, and it could be more inaccessible, it's easier to make it more difficult for people to vote by mail or electronically, it's easier to make it so that people can't vote, by like exclusionary voter ID practices, it's easier to put elections all on different days, at different times, to make it harder for people to vote, but when you make voting compulsory, and people face the possibility of getting punished for not voting, I think that there's going to be a whole lot of pressure to make sure that, if people have to vote, then voting is much more accessible to people.

And, I think that that's absolutely great for political participation, and I think that the result of this is that more people are going to participate, and you're going to see spikes in turnout.

That's huge, because it means that the state is more representative.

Policy is going to be more representative to the politicians, politicians can act more powerfully and decisively, because they have a stronger mandate of the people, and there's not like this like possibility of like, well, half the people didn't participate, and a couple of thousand votes in one or two areas can swing the entire election.

You're gonna have much more of a possibility of, like, what the what people actually want.

So, for all those reasons, compulsory voting should be introduced.

"sam_3581_cheerleading_con_opening_rachel","3581","CON","sam","rachel","I stand in firm opposition to the motion we should end cheerleading.

Cheerleading is a sport just like any other.

It has inherent value insofar as it allows young women and men in some cases to get outside, exercise, express themselves artistically.

My opponent tries to tell you that cheerleading is inherently sexualized but it's unclear why cheerleading is anymore sexualized than dance, gymnastics, or any other sport which sponsors women or features women in a way that does not require them to have full physical contact or to throw a ball through a hoop.

To that end, we think that people being able to choose cheerleading, giving someone an option for what they want to do will always be beneficial.

This is my first argument, the value of individual preference because cheerleading would be bad if we forced every individual to do it.

If I had no choice in the matter and had to be a cheerleader, I would very likely dislike it.

Whoever, it is simply one of a myriad of options which we allow to young people in high school or even sometimes middle school.

This means the individuals who choose to go into cheerleading are those who have determined it will give them the greatest amount of benefits, those who have a clear preference for this.

The only clear moral system we can derive is one in which we value individual preference.

We cannot express that there is some god above who gave us rights or preferences because that would inherently contradict other individual's religions and there's no way we could make a cohesive system out of it.

Similarly, we can't say that the state is wholly just in all of its actions because we think that it is equally fallible to the individual.

To that end, the only system in which there is true universal value is one in which we give individuals preference and allow them to follow their preferences.

By giving individuals the option of cheerleading, we inherently support this moral system and allow individuals to self-actualize more effectively.

But my next two arguments are about how cheerleading has inherent value even if we were to say force everyone to do it.

My next argument is about the value of athleticism.

In the united states particularly, we think obesity is a massive problem.

As time goes on more and more young people suffer from being overweight or obese due in large part to a lack of physical activity.

When the only option available to individuals it's full contact sports or essentially being on the computer all day, we think individuals will ultimately make bad decisions.

We think that full contact sports are regularly dangerous things like rugby, football, are very likely to cause long term damage particularly if individuals get concussions and sitting in front of the computer all day inherently makes individuals less healthy as they spend less time on their feet actually developing their muscles.

By allowing cheerleading we allow individuals a better avenue for athleticism, allow them to learn how to throw other people, become more flexible, and generally just be healthier.

My final argument is the value of art because we think that cheerleading just like gymnastics and dance is a form of art.

Individuals come together and form routines which are very regularly intricate.

They put incredible thought into this and ultimately are very impressive when they actually go on display.

We think that cheerleading then is one of the most pure forms of art as it allows individuals to soar through the air in a way that is simply not available in other avenues.

We think that the value of art comes from individuals individual preference first off, but also simply the miraculous, the splendid.

We think that cheerleading falls into this category because it allows individuals to go beyond the regular means by working as a group and doing something truly miraculous.

For this reason, we should not end cheerleading.

"rachel_3581_cheerleading_con_opening_james","3581","CON","rachel","james","We should not end cheerleading.

Recognize first and foremost that men will always objectify women.

All of drew's arguments work for banning literally any female sport insofar as men sexualize any female sport.

I think a really good example of this is tennis in which even though we recognize that the women there have worked incredibly hard and are like equal to their male athletes in terms of status, the way in which they are demeaned and viewed by society is very much in terms of the clothing that they wear and how attractive they are.

Recognize that the only actions we can control is our own and that whatever men do with our bodies or with the images of our bodies are separate from us insofar as we do not control their minds.

We also think it's incredibly problematic to say that because men are shitty, we ought change the behavior of women and have them have less of a community and less ability to choose their support.

If this was the logic that we followed, we think it would also follow that the response to islamophobia is to stop being be muslim, or the response to any kind of like discrimination, on any basis, means to stop identifying with that thing.

Insofar as women are always going to be women and they cannot control their bodies or the way that they are perceived, we think that they ought have as many rights as possible and that these rights ought not be limited based on the fact that men can't control themselves.

Two main areas of clash: the first as about cheerleading as a valid form of a of athletics and art.

Drew already concedes that cheerleading is a physically challenging activity, but it is also physically unique in that the actions that are that are taken during cheerleading are distinct from what you'd find in other sports, whether it be dance, which many consider to be quite similar, or like a true sport, such as football or soccer or basketball.

What this means is that it is valid to prefer the activity of cheerleading to another sport given that it is not the case that the actions are intermixable.

Like just just because basically what we're saying is that because someone could prefer the motions that are gone through in cheerleading to something else, it is not the place of the government or any one individual to say that you could do any other sport instead.

We think that people should have as many choices as possible because in the end, they know their own situation and what will help them self-actualize more than any other individual.

Recognize that drew's arguments are all for changing societal messages messaging.

We think that it would be preferable to tell football players to respect cheerleaders, maybe don't give them overly sexual costumes or motions.

All of these things are changeable without saying that without declaiming the entirety of the sport.

Second, though, we want to talk about cheerleading as a form of empowerment.

Because recognize that women get sexualized day to day, regardless of their consent into those systems.

It is more than this though, we are socialized into these systems in which we are told to accept the fact that men will sexualize us without our consent and without our participation.

We think that at the end of the day, you should provide many as many avenues as possible by which women can then reclaim their sexuality, and we think that cheerleading is an example of a sport that does that incredibly well.

We think that being able to give women a world in which they can define their own sexuality through their own motions, in which they can subvert their men's images of themselves, as one can with with cheerleading is really important.

And we think that if someone chooses to do cheerleading of their own volition for a long time, like recognize that I think neither side of the house supports children who are forced into cheerleading, but we think that this is true for any kind of sport.

Like my mother wouldn't let me quit dancing for a really, really long time, but that doesn't mean that I necessarily think that it was a bad like that we should stop dance altogether.

In the at the end, all our side advocates for is a world in which women can choose to do cheerleading, and that and we like we don't understand why the government should be able to prevent that.

For these reasons, proud to oppose.

"james_3581_cheerleading_pro_opening","3581","PRO","james","","We should end cheerleading.

So we think that the US predominantly, but also other countries where cheerleading has taken hold, should pass legislation to end public support for it, and that we shouldn't have things like cheerleaders at pro sports games or parades and other events.

We would prefer a world where cheerleading was done away with, even if it's not explicitly banned.

A couple of arguments for our side.

The first is that we think cheerleading is demeaning to women.

At its root, cheerleading equates women's appearance with men's ability.

So, because cheerleading is usually associated in the US, where almost all cheerleaders are located, with sports like football, ultimately you are equating the football players with the cheerleaders.

But how are these two things different?

The football players are exhibiting athletic prowess and incredible skill and talent, in a way where people respect them because of the hard work that they put in and their incredible skill.

The cheerleaders certainly do work hard and I don't want to say that they're not, and that they don't have skill because clearly they do, and their routines are quite complex, but they're being valued more for their appearance and attractiveness, more than anything else.

What's more, they're being used as a display to encourage the football players and to encourage fans to be more supportive of their team, rather than being celebrated in their own right.

And while it's true that there are now standalone cheerleading competitions today, people still generally associate cheerleading with this traditional role that they've had in encouraging football players and other athletes to play better, and encouraging people to root better for their male compatriots.

So ultimately, because cheerleading reduces women to the status of props for men's athletics, we think that this is really demeaning.

That it encourages people to ignore these women's abilities or skills or talents, and only look to their appearance and how well they encourage the fans to root for their male counterparts.

Ultimately, this seems very demeaning to the women who participate in this.

And we think that the alternative world in which these women are playing sports on their own, or participating in other activities where they can be celebrated and rewarded for their hard work, would be a better one compared to the world in which they are cheerleaders.

I know the other side will say that people like opt into being cheerleaders and want to do this, but that doesn't mean that it's a good thing.

People make bad decisions all the time, and even if people want to do something, that doesn't mean that it's something that's good for them.

Our second argument is that we think this is exploitative of little girls.

Ultimately, there's nothing wrong with sexualizing grown women who are sexual beings and or have the ability to consent into this and understand it.

But because cheerleading is something that's so sexualized, we think it's problematic that it's so prominent for young women or young girls to participate in.

Many girls begin cheerleading even before middle school, when they're pre-pubescent, yet the outfits that they wear and the routines that they perform are still sexualized.

And this only continues into high school or middle school, when the girls are sexualized even further, especially by media that often portrays them as the natural people for athletes to date or have sex with.

So we think that ultimately, it's somewhat creepy and certainly exploitive to encourage little girls to go into an activity that sexualizes them, and treats them more as objects for the enjoyment of these athletes than it does as individuals.

Moreover, we don't think that these girls can positively opt into becoming cheerleaders, because they're too young to understand the implications of the sexual implications of the activity that they're participating in.

So ultimately, because this is demeaning to women, and because it sexualizes young girls, we think that we should end cheerleading.

Thank you.

"rachel_3581_cheerleading_pro_opening","3581","PRO","rachel","","We should end cheerleading.

Two main areas of clash, first about the over-sexualization of youth.

We think that it's true that cheerleading as a sport is entirely based on the sexualization of eighth grade to twelfth grade girls.

We see this in terms of the revealing dance moves, the skimpy costumes, and to the fact that they only exist in order to motivate male ballplayers on a field.

And the fact that it has always been majority marketed towards women and only started to include men when it became like a principled thing, like yes, let's have one or two men on the team who want to do it.

We think that what this does is it presents these girls as objects for male consumption, and as such it influences the way that these people see them in the future.

Like if I'm a football player and I've been taught that these people are here to cheer me like me on, and here for my entertainment and my pleasure and like my motivation, then why would this be something that I would recognize as like individual people who I ought treat with respect or with dignity, if I have been taught that they don't actually deserve either of those things.

We think that this influences these people into the long term, insofar as these become the like adults who also watch these kinds of things from the sidelines and see these individuals to be just as like sexualized and objectified for their use as the like those who are younger.

It indicates this also it's like a generalizable thing to all women, it says like look, like women in general are sexually gratifying, they're here to service you, and that's something that young men already learn from a really young age from other stimuli, but something that gets massively reinforced when they see cheerleaders out on the field.

This is especially problematic because it teaches young girls to see themselves in this way as well.

Like when society tells you that you are something for long enough, you tend to start believing it, especially when this comes from figures of authority or people who you respect, or if this is the way that like the majority of the men in your grade treat you, if this is how you were taught you gain popularity, as we often see surrounding cheerleading culture in general, and we think that's actually incredibly problematic.

It poisons the ability of the self to see yourself in an empowering manner and to see yourself as an equal to men specifically.

We think this is actually quite obvious, like how do you see yourself as an equal to someone that you were taught you are an object for the pleasure of, like we think that a lot of this also comes with signaling like the stereotype of the cheerleader who gets together with the with like the boy from the football team, and like this is something that teachers propagate in really subtle ways, and so we actually don't see any kind of solution to this except to abolish the entire sport.

Like given that it literally has no other purpose besides to objectify women and show that they are just objects for male consumption, we don't understand why we ought value its existence at all.

This brings us to our second area of clash, which is about working against the gendering of athletics.

Recognize that cheerleading is is like represents a blatant creation of a sport just for women when there isn't actually a need.

Women are perfectly capable of doing things like football, soccer, dance.

Recognize that cheerleading is literally dance, except dance usually doesn't doesn't have as many like sexually submissive undertones to it.

So we actually think that like there's literally no unique niche that cheerleading fills, so we don't understand why it exists in the first place.

It's just there to propagate the objectification of women in a society that and like to tell us that we value boys more than girls, which is why our girls are like relegated to this motivation role, rather than being the focus of the game in the way that football players are.

We think that what this is about is a round about whether what kind of options we provide and what kids are pushed toward, and we're unclear on why there ought be an there ought be an option or an influence to do something like cheerleading that is clearly so detrimental, when there are sports that are infinitely less problematic out there.

Proud to propose.
