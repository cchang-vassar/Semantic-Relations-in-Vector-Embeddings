"GPR-KB-1","We need to think about how this affects us right now.","It is necessary to balance short-term and long-term concerns. The long-term effects in this case greatly outweigh the short-term ones."
"GPR-KB-2","<ACTION><TOPIC> will benefit us in the future.","There are many things that could theoretically benefit us in the future. Unfortunately we have to look realistically at our available resources and deal with the immediate needs of the people."
"GPR-KB-3","<ACTION><TOPIC> will lead to greater problems in the future.","Governments have an obligation to their citizens in the here and now. The better off society is today, the more resources we will have to make the future better when it comes."
"GPR-KB-4","<ACTION><TOPIC> will not solve the problem.","Rarely is it possible to completely solve a problem. We are aiming to make the situation better for society and to send a clear message, which this policy does."
"GPR-KB-5","<ACTION><TOPIC> is the most practical way to solve the problem.","We cannot make decisions based solely on practicality. We cannot justify unfair and heavy-handed means based on a desired result."
"GPR-KB-6","<ACTION><TOPIC> is not the most practical way to solve the problem.","Practicality is not the only consideration. Our goal should be to find an approach that is equitable and sends the right message, not a quick and dirty fix."
"GPR-KB-7","Alternative methods exist to deal with this problem.","True, there are some alternatives, but this method is effective and has minimal harms and as such is the most suitable for implementation."
"GPR-KB-8","If there are problems we can fix them.","The problems are significant enough that a band-aid solution just won't work. We need a completely different approach."
"GPR-KB-9","<ACTION><TOPIC> will harm others.","While some risk of harm may exist, the value of this policy greatly outweighs those harms."
"GPR-KB-10","<ACTION><TOPIC> puts society at risk.","Some risks will always exist, we cannot eliminate risk entirely from our lives. The benefits involved outweigh the risks."
"GPR-KB-11","<ACTION><TOPIC> does not put society at risk.","<ACTION><TOPIC> may not lead to the immediate demise of civilization, but that doesn't mean it is a good idea. <ACTION><TOPIC> still entails harms that should not be taken lightly."
"GPR-KB-12","<TOPIC> [involves/involve] risks to the individual.","We allow individuals to take risks as long as they are fully informed and rational. "
"GPR-KB-13","<TOPIC> [has/have] many benefits.","While <TOPIC> [has/have] some benefits, they are outweighed by the risks."
"GPR-KB-14","<ACTION><TOPIC> is what is best for individuals.","We cannot make decisions for individuals in society, even if we think we know what is right and wrong. In a democracy we must let people make their own decisions, even if they make bad decisions."
"GPR-KB-15","<ACTION><TOPIC> limits personal choice.","While governments strive to afford citizens as much personal choice as possible, those choices must be limited when there is a clash with a more important right or clear harms to society at large. This case falls under those criteria."
"GPR-KB-16","<ACTION><TOPIC> protects personal choice.","While governments strive to afford citizens as much personal choice as possible, those choices must be limited when there is a clash with a more important right or clear harms to society at large. This case falls under those criteria."
"GPR-KB-17","This is a legitimate choice to make.","While we wish we could always allow everyone full freedom of choice, we need to recognize the risks to individuals and those around them and take measures to protect those individuals."
"GPR-KB-18","We must limit personal choice in this case.","The greater good means nothing if the rights of individuals are being violated. It doesn't make sense to violate rights in order to protect them."
"GPR-KB-19","People don't always make rational choices.","The real question is whether most people make rational choices most of the time in this situation, and the answer to that is yes."
"GPR-KB-20","<ACTION><TOPIC> violates a basic right.","We cannot look at each right in a vacuum. We need to see how they intersect with other rights and other needs. In cases such as this, some rights must be compromised."
"GPR-KB-21","<TOPIC> [violates/violate] a basic right.","We cannot look at each right in a vacuum. We need to see how they intersect with other rights and other needs. In cases such as this, some rights must be compromised."
"GPR-KB-22","<ACTION><TOPIC> does not violate a basic right.","The question of which rights are basic and which are not is subjective, and is beside the point. Policies like <ACTION><TOPIC> lead to an erosion of societal rights and values."
"GPR-KB-23","<ACTION><TOPIC> sends a negative message to society.","People tend to hear what they want to hear and while some people may hear a negative message from this policy, the government needs to do what is right and just."
"GPR-KB-24","<ACTION><TOPIC> sends a positive message to society.","People tend to hear what they want to hear. The goal should be to do the right thing, not to send a message that some people might like."
"GPR-KB-25","<ACTION><TOPIC> will encourage better choices.","There are other ways to encourage better choices that don't require such a forceful government intervention."
"GPR-KB-26","<ACTION><TOPIC> will not encourage better choices.","Policies are not always meant to encourage and educate, but also to lay down guidelines and rules for a better functioning society. <ACTION><TOPIC> is necessary from both a principled and a practical point of view."
"GPR-KB-27","<TOPIC> [is/are] impossible to regulate.","Even if regulation is difficult we cannot simply abandon a good and just law. The message alone is enough to justify <ACTION><TOPIC>."
"GPR-KB-28","The government is bad at making these kind of decisions.","The government knows what its citizens need and is held accountable by the public, making it the best-placed body to make these decisions."
"GPR-KB-29","The government knows how to make these kind of decisions.","Unfortunately, the government is actually very bad at making such decisions, because it is weighed down by bureaucracy, inefficiency and corruption."
"GPR-KB-30","<ACTION><TOPIC> gives the government too much power.","It is easy to scare people with the idea of abuse of power, but the fact is that the government is held accountable by the public to ensure that it is doing a good job. While a government is in power, we need to afford it the tools to protect and serve the public."
"GPR-KB-31","<TOPIC> [gives/give] the government too much power.","It is easy to scare people with the idea of abuse of power, but the fact is that the government is held accountable by the public to ensure that it is doing a good job. While a government is in power, we need to afford it the tools to protect and serve the public."
"GPR-KB-32","We need to send a strong message.","There are many ways to send a strong message to society. The harmful effects of this particular method make it a bad choice."
"GPR-KB-33","We need to protect the weakest members of society.","A truly fair society is one where different people are afforded similar rights and are also trusted to look after themselves. While weaker segments of society can be more vulnerable, this does not justify paternalistic policies that are not beneficial for society as a whole."
"GPR-KB-34","<ACTION><TOPIC> disproportionately harms minorities.","Most policies carry extra burdens on minorities because of burdens we carry from historical injustices. This is a separate issue that should be addressed on a wide scale. As far as <ACTION><TOPIC> is concerned, the focus should be on the overall effects of the policy on society as a whole."
"GPR-KB-35","<ACTION><TOPIC> particularly benefits minorities.","Helping minorities is a positive goal, but it is also important to look at the big picture. Overall, the harms of <ACTION><TOPIC> outweigh the potential benefits."
"GPR-KB-36","<TOPIC> only [benefits/benefit] a small segment of society.","Strengthening small segments of society has a ripple effect and does good for society as a whole. "
"GPR-KB-37","The private sector is profit-driven and therefore unable to serve the public.","For-profit companies have an interest to care about their customers and want to ensure high quality products so they can sell as much as possible. They have the resources to satisfy the public's needs in a way that the public sector cannot compete with."
"GPR-KB-38","<ACTION><TOPIC> is good for the economy.","While we need to take the economy into account when making decisions, it cannot be the sole consideration or even the top priority in many cases. In this case, the harms outweigh any benefits there may be to the economy."
"GPR-KB-39","<ACTION><TOPIC> is bad for the economy.","While we need to take the economy into account when making decisions, it cannot be the sole consideration or even the top priority in many cases. In this case, the long-term benefits outweigh any immediate harms there may be to the economy."
"GPR-KB-40","<ACTION><TOPIC> will save the government a lot of money.","Money cannot be our primary concern in this case. There are other concerns that far outweigh the potential monetary gain."
"GPR-KB-41","<ACTION><TOPIC> will cost too much.","There is always a way to find funding for things we deem important. The real question is whether or not we see value in this policy, and in this case it is clear that we do."
"GPR-KB-42","<TOPIC> [is/are] a waste of public funds.","Nothing is free in this world. The benefits of this policy are well worth the cost."
"GPR-KB-43","<TOPIC> [is/are] a good use of public funds.","There are certainly more important things than <TOPIC> to spend money on. In any case, it is unfair to burden the taxpayers with these costs. "
"GPR-KB-44","This will make it harder for new people to enter the field.","This may be true, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't take this step. The benefits involved outweigh this concern, and perhaps those who will be deterred aren't suited for this field to begin with."
"GPR-KB-45","This will make it easier for new people to enter the field.","This may be true, but it doesn't mean we should take this step. The harms involved outweigh this consideration, and perhaps those who will enter the field aren't suited for it to begin with."
"GPR-KB-46","Adopting this proposal will lead to backlash.","Some amount of backlash will always exist. We cannot allow a small and vocal minority to dictate the choices we make as a society."
"GPR-KB-47","These risks exist elsewhere as well.","Indeed there are some similar cases out there and we should look at those cases as well, and see if they fit the same criteria and should be dealt with accordingly."
"GPR-KB-48","Animals have rights.","A system of rights is based on reciprocity. Without the ability to contribute to society and fulfill certain duties, you have no rights."
"GPR-KB-49","Animals don't have rights.","Just because humans have certain intellectual advantages over other animals, this does not justify treating them as mere property. Morality dictates that the basic interests of animals must be given due consideration."
"GPR-KB-50","Animals deserve protection.","The animal kingdom is all about hierarchy. Humans are at the top of the food chain and using animals for our own needs is only natural."
"GPR-KB-51","Animals do not deserve protection.","In order to maintain our own morality, humans should protect those weaker than themselves, not treat them cruelly."
"GPR-KB-52","<ACTION><TOPIC> harms the environment.","Humans are not a separate entity to the environment. For millennia the world has learned to adapt itself to its inhabitants, weather changes, and everything else that can affect its well-being. We can't stop ourselves from developing and furthering humanity in the name of the environment. "
"GPR-KB-53","<ACTION><TOPIC> benefits the environment.","Humans are not a separate entity to the environment. For millennia the world has learned to adapt itself to its inhabitants, weather changes, and everything else that can affect its well-being. Our decision should be based on developing and furthering humanity, not on some obscure environmental risk or benefit."
"GPR-KB-54","We can't make the environment a priority right now.","We have a duty to future generations to do as much as we can to protect the environment and make it livable for them."
"GPR-KB-55","We must make the environment a priority right now.","Our priority should be taking care of current human needs and interests. Placing excessive focus on theoretical environmental concerns comes at the direct expense of the population and its immediate well-being."
