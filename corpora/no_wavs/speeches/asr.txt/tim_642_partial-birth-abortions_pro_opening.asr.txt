Partial birth abortions.
So before we start the debate, we also want to say that as part of banning this type of abortion, we want to say that if you were to do this, you would also allow more open access to abortion and the first trimester to ensure that women have the option of getting an abortion we don't want to end this type of abortion and additionally bad other types of abortion we want to expand access to others, but we think that this type of abortion isn't justified, we can get actively harmful to women and women's rights.
Okay, so first, we're gonna talk about what justifies abortion and why this doesn't meet that justification exactly when I talk about the negative political will associated with partial birth abortion.
So firstly, on justification we think that there are a couple of main justifications for abortion in the status quo we think the primary justification is that based on a balancing of rights abortion should be allowed that women's bodily autonomy outweighs the fetuses right to life for the fact that at the time one woman would have an abortion, a fetus is not viable, it isn't capable of using its cognizance of isn't able to make judgments it isn't able to live outside the womb of the mother and therefore is entirely dependent on that mother.
We think that this is the fun fair expectation placed on a woman, and we think that there are numerous reasons why one of my one have an abortion that are entirely justified and don't mean that she opted in to having a child for example, in cases of rape in cases where birth control proved ineffective.
But the woman took all proper steps to ensure that you wouldn't get pregnant and we think that a woman's ability to use her bodily autonomy to choose how her body is going to interact with the world around her and what is going to happen to her body, especially something as drastic as carrying the child to term and given birth, we think that this is something that a woman should have full autonomy in making the decision, especially given the case that early in the trial early in the pregnancy, a fetus is not capable is not a viable living creature that arguments for potentiality open a paradox in which we give preference to potential creatures to potential life in all instances we make things such as masturbation and things like that and having sex for reasons other than intercourse, we think you would also have to ban those things under a potentiality argument because all sperm could become a child all it could become a child, and we think that the potentiality argument justin used to a slippery slope, but we think the case of a partial birth simply a late term abortions we don't think the same arguments holed up here at a point in which the child the fetuses become viable, and therefore the question is no longer one of potentiality, but one of weighing the right to life that this living creature, this bible creature has against the rights to bodily autonomy of the woman, especially because if you increase access to abortion and other times, we think that the woman has had full capability of expressing her bodily autonomy has had a full has had the full range of time an opportunity to do so and not choosing to do so earlier we find the right of the fetus then out weighs the mother in the long run.
Okay, certainly on political.
Well, we think that because partial birth abortions are such a dramatic and kind of visceral thing that can be portrayed in the media by anti abortion activists and other groups of the like we think that by banning partial birth abortion you're more likely to get political will for other types of abortion.
We think that when people can paint abortions all abortions has this kind of this really negative thing, it increases political will from those on the fence for moderates against abortion for all we think that by banning partial birth abortion you make it less likely that these types of visual images are going to come out less likely that anti abortion activists are going to be able to paint this is all abortions and therefore more likely that in the long run more women are able to express their bodily autonomy.
And if you keep partial birth of partial birth abortions as an actual option for these reasons, we should ban partial birth abortions.
