I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban anonymous posts on the enforcement mechanism will basically be to just shut down websites that allow anonymous posting on so, you know, presumably most sites associated with large firms will obviously just comply with this, you know, sites like twitter, for example, that allowed just sort of like a counts were you to which can allow for anonymous commenting on.
We would say that this always has to be associated with like an actual person, and we would just outright shut down sites that are completely predicated upon anonymous posting so like yak yak and things like that, two independent points first is that anonymous posting allows for more vitriolic online discourse and that this is inherently problematic.
I think there's really two ways in which this breaks down.
So broadly what happens here is that because people are able to hide behind it in on the machine they're not, you know, particularly accountable for whatever it is that they say but they're more likely to see things that are deliberate lee inflammatory or deliberately offensive on either just because they think they can get away with it and they genuinely hold those views or because they're just trying to be inflammatory and just trying to get a rise out of somebody.
So then the two ways really that we see this breaking down and causing harm is first is the personal harms that people are more likely to target individuals and on, you know, actually harass them online.
So I think one particularly good example of this is on the way that leslie jones was harassed on twitter, you know, having racial racial epitaphs slurred at her and misogynist at the paths.
So this type of harassment is directly facilitated by anonymous commenting because people don't have to remain on my accountable for what it is that they're saying.
But secondly, there's the discursive harm that broadly online discourse becomes more vitriolic becomes were confrontational, because there is this norm, sat around the internet that people are just going to be more aggressive when they're behind anonymous shield, we think that to an extent, this still happens even when you're not personally face to face with the individual, but it is significantly and even exponentially more problematic when there is no way for there to be any sort of accountability for these types of actions because the discourse shifts to be more vitriolic on the internet, when there's not anonymous component, we think there's a more long lasting effect on our societal discourse patterns in that we are, you know, more likely to be competitive with one another in that we are you more likely to see other says you the enemy and less willing to take, you know, rationalize with another because of just sort of the way there online commenting has shaped the way that our society talks with one another.
The second independent point that I'd like to advance is a general lack of accountability for actions suit just beyond sort of the ways in which this affects how we talk to one another there's also the broader issue of accountability.
First, I think this is something that just a principled issue that arm when we speak bomb, we should be accountable for the things that we say we want on individual, you know, sentences and sentiments to be tied to an individual because we only care about things being expressed in the first place because there is an individual behind that sentiment we think that when sentiments just kind of come out of the ether because their voice by anonymous trolls or whatever that's a problem because that means that there is a really significant portions of our societal discourse that don't have an actual source that don't stem from an individual person.
But we also think that that lack of you know, connection to an individual person is harmful for lawn for spent reasons that anonymity on the internet has, you know, made it very difficult to enforce things like, say hate crime laws because you can essentially target people anonymously on you are less accountable from a legal perspective to answer for your actions and to answer for the the harm you have placed on society by encouraging this type of discourse and bike incurring these types of harm's on people proud to propose.
