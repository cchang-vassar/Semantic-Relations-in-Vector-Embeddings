We should not further exploit unconventional oil.
We think that the status quo there are many avenues, clean energy, better being developed in other opportunities that we can unconventional oil simply crowds out and that we think is unnecessary so we're gonna talk about too many things were going to talk about why I'm conventional oil is simply bad for the environment, and why that matters more than anything else and then going to talk about alternative methods of getting energy in one those are preferable.
Okay, so recognize that alternate methods of oil are the least clean ways of extracting oil going to things like sands and using fracking aren't, both incredibly difficult in the status quo, which means the method of extraction, both requires the use of energy in order to extract a higher rate than other types of energy extraction, but also have the most impact on local ecology, you need to do trillion, you need to do types of things that ruin the habitats of animals that exist in these areas oftentimes in areas that have already been decimated by the impact of climate change.
So one of the two impacts of these bad things first destroys local ecosystems when you destroy local ecosystems, we think that there are massive long term ramifications in the area if you desolate ecosystems definitely habitat, it means that many species can be put at risk.
It means that the entire environment change which could have ramifications on every on everything from agriculture in the area to weather in the area to basically people's standard of living in these areas, we don't think that this is worth it to extract more dirty energy.
The other thing that can happen which often happens, especially with methods like fracking is stop polluting the water supply when you polluted water supply, especially in some areas that are simply already at risk of losing water at losing access to clean water, especially with global warming, decreasing the level of access to clean water across the globe, we think that was likely to happen is that the people he's area are going to suffer because of because of unconventional oil.
It means their access to clean water goes down in this is a basic necessity that these people need in order for their survival, and you don't think that it's necessary to adopt these types of these types of energy.
We simply think that in the status quo we are on the path that is unsustainable that global warming is an inevitability that we need to try and stop right now.
Before you reach up further tipping point, we think that even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way, even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems you're only adding to the problem in the status quo you're, only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced, which we think is unacceptable is unacceptable is only going to lead to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people.
And even for people the status quo we think that this isn't worth it, especially given the alternatives that exist also recognize that alternate clean methods of energy are becoming incredibly increasingly cheap and viable things like solar wind and hydro technologies are becoming more and more efficient every year, and as they become more efficient, these methods also become cheaper, which is why we've seen the rise in solar technology, not just in the united states, but also in more developing nations like china because it's becoming even more efficient even more worthwhile to use given that these other methods of technology exist and that even if they may be expensive in the status quo, there are also avenues for more information innovation surrounding green technologies, running things like wind and solar energy are simply more innovative than using oil using the same energy methods that we've been using for the past hundred years for the past two hundred years, we think that when you subs even if it means you need to subsidize the the type of energy I mean you're likely to get more innovation and you're guaranteed not to increase pollution, not only are these energies are useful for emissions rates that they lower CO two emissions, but they're also really environmentally friendly for local habitats.
You don't need to destroy an entire ecosystem in order to collect sunlight or wind from a certain area given that these clean technologies are increasingly becoming efficient.
We simply do not think it is necessary nor do we think it is worth while to explain further on conventional oil.
We think that we would rather use methods that are going to do in the future of our planet that I'm going to do in future societies.
And for these reasons we should not further exploit unconventional oil.
