We should introduce covenant marriages to be clear.
We wouldn't students system in which covenant marriage is mandated, but rather, we would allow for there to be legal option to be bound under a covenant marriage as opposed to a standard marriage that exists within society in this would of course would come with the constraints of making it much more difficult to receive a divorce with different types of pressure being placed on the individual to ensure that they stay married in the long run.
We would say that these covenant marriages can be an old if certain requirements are being that believes that those requirements and a much higher level than marriages are in the status quo.
Okay, so firstly, about the option for religious expression in the second rate, what long term marriage does as a social good nice that even if society doesn't believe that should be stopped certain religious values having the option of a covenant marriage option that recognizes the importance religiously of not having to force of staying married, does not ensure that a state endorses any particular religion rather simply gives individuals within that state an option of more full religious expression.
It means that individuals can go to a group or go to the state and have something legally binding placed upon them that helps them stay true to their faith.
We think this is important because for those most faithful and vigils, we think that they should be forced to consider the ramifications of their decision more clearly before they get married, they should be forced to recognize that the bond they are taking even if it is not in the status quo legally binding in perpetuity is one that because of their belief system is permanently binding.
And we think that if a state apparatus can allow for that for you to be more meaningfully expressed it would allow that faith to be more fully expressed in if it puts constraints that makes people seriously consider their faith more when it only applies to individuals that have that faith, we think there's no loss instituting this type of system.
We think it's good that individuals are able to have the most old type of religious expression because these types of religions, these types of religious beliefs about marriage about connection with the spouse are so fulfilling to individuals in the status quo.
So aside from the religious benefits we think that there are you'll benefits to long term marriage that a covenant marriage helps to protect because it makes it so it's much more difficult to get divorced.
Firstly, it ensures that if you are interested because you're thinking more about your marriage you're more likely to marry someone that's going to be a stable partner so whether or not you love your partner, a permanent partner does allow for an immense amount of financial and social security, even instances when you may be struggling when you're tying to someone and when you have a partner in life that is going to the same types of struggles you are that is bound to your struggles and makes it much easier to bear the burden of that struggle.
It also means that if you're having a long term marriage too much more likely to have a stable household for any potential children, children have no choice about what type of nearly all household they're going to be born in and it's just it's just agree true that single parent households are much more likely to lead to a situation which a child troubles moving forward in life.
We think that covenant marriages because it makes it more difficult to get divorced is more likely to ensure that you don't have single parent households today you have a situation in which both parents feel a responsibility to stay for the child.
Finally, we think because we think finally, we think there's a benefit something that you're less likely to get into a legal battle over assets which can be not only struggling in a detrimental to any sort of semblance of relationship you have with the person you're getting divorced from but can also leave you an immense destitution moving forward in life.
We think that marriage is an institution allows you to have a partner allows you to support children potentially allows you to be in a more stable situation, giving a covenant marriage is not mandated, but rather an option we see no downside to the government introduced in it and that's why we should introduce covenant.
