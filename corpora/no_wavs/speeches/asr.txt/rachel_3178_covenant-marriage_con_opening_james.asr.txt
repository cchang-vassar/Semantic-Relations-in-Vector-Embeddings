When it comes to covenant marriages, it's unclear why we need the government to recognize it given that individuals and communities can still recognize it personally drew never points out why there are specific benefits to the government, recognizing these marriages as well, except to say that it is more easily regularly double and I'll tell you why he's wrong about that leader too many areas of clash, the first on why these kinds of marriages tropic people and often especially women in marriages that might not be happy in the long term recognize first that even though people might get extensive counselling before entering a marriage might think that they know these person people so well, it is often not the case that you can predict everything that will occur in your future.
No one gets married thinking that it will end in divorce the reason that we do not put up extra barriers to divorce is because we recognize that these kinds of things that people change and that we and that we have to let them escape and change themselves as their relationships change as well drew was so worried about freedom, but he decreases it by making these assumptions he says that people who enter are going to be so consenting, we don't think this is true.
We think these individuals usually group in these communities that are pressured to participate and more than this are often not provided with another option.
It is only after you are an adult that you can actually be able to explore the rest of the world around you and recognize what your real decisions meant or what you have signed yourself up for so a lot of the time these people get married quite young around eighteen to twenty and it's not until later in their lives, they recognize, but they gave up or have more access to the outside world.
So we think that when you do things like recognize covenant marriage by the state, you are not only allowing these people to be pressured by their communities to maintain an unhappy marriage but also allowing the state to put pressure on them as well and preventing the state from interfering in these situations because it recognizes this covenant as legal, we think women are especially susceptible to this in so far as a lot of the time these communities place less value on female happiness and force them into patriarchal roles in the house and they're like often given police choice over their futures.
So we think that at least on our side of the house, if someone decides that they're done, they can get state backing to escape the situation on their side, you make it to the government can no longer interfere in these marriages when someone says I am done because it recognize the covenant as legal and forces them to continue through these difficulties, our secondary of class has to do with white, gives even more power and control to religious communities.
We think that the church and state kept as separate as possible because the state obligation ought to be to people not to religious bodies, and when you recognize covenant marriage you seed more control over people's lives, two religions, we think this is problematic because religion is often run by patriarchal outdated and sexist norms.
So a lot of the time these kinds of religious covenants, not only are women being given away their young, not only are they like being told that things oftentimes like birth control is immoral they're, not really given control over their own bodies, their pleasures vilified, but now the state recognizes these acts as legal and says okay, like were all right with this, let religion take that control what drew says that it's easier to regulate he's just wrong, because the only time that this is regulated will at all is when it's not legally recognized because that recognition binds the speed state to specific action.
So in the status quo, if there is a covenant marriage and someone says I'm done and the religious community says no you're, not you agreed to this, then the state is obligated to say the religious community is wrong inside with the individual, but on their side of the house.
What occurs is that because the state has recognized this, they must allow the church to go on with its proceedings drew pretends these proceedings are no big deal, but recognize the control out counseling infinitely for these reasons, proud to oppose.
