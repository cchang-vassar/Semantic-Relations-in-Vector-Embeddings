We should not and recognize first and foremost, that men will always objectify women.
All of jews, arguments work for banning literally any female sport in so far as men sexualized any female sport.
I think a really good example of this is tennis in which even though we recognize that the women there have worked incredibly hard in our public equal to their male athletes in terms of status, the way in which they are demeaned and viewed by society is very much in terms of the clothing that they wear and how attractive they are recognize that the only actions we can control is our own, and that whatever men do with our bodies or with the images of our bodies are separate from us in so far as we do not control their minds.
We also think it's incredibly problematic to say that because men are shitty, we change the behavior of women and have them have less of a community unless ability to choose their support.
If this was the order that we followed, we think it would also follow that the response to islamophobia mr slopping muslim with a response to any kind of like discrimination on any basis means to stop identifying with that thing in so far as women are always going to be women in it, cannot control their bodies or the way that they are perceived, we think that they ought have as many rights as possible and that these rights ought not be limited based on the fact that men can't control themselves too many areas of clash.
The first asked about cheerleading as a balance form of athletics and art drew already concedes that cheerleading is a physically challenging activity, but it is also physically unique in that the actions that are that are taken during cheerleading are distinct from what you'd find in other sports, whether it be dance, which many consider to be quite similar war, like a true sports, such as football or soccer or basketball.
What this means is that it is valid to preferred the activity of cheerleading to another sport given that it is not the case, the actions are intermixed double like just because basically what we're saying is that because someone could prefers the motions that are gone through cheerleading to something else, it is not the place of the government or any one individual to say that you could do any other sport in step.
We think that people should have as many choices as possible because in the end, it may know their own situation, and what will help them self actualized more than any other individual on recognize the druze arguments are all for changing societal messages message, we think that it would be preferable to tell football players to respect your leaders on maybe don't give them overly sexual costumes, emotions, all of these things are changeable without saying that without to claiming the entirety of the sport second, though we wanna talk about cheerleading as a form of empowerment because recognize that women get sexualized day today regardless of their consent into those systems, it is more than this, though we are socialized into the systems in which we are told to accept the fact that men will sexualized us without our consent without our participation.
We think that at the end of the day, you should provide many as many avenues as possible by which women can reclaim their sexuality.
We think that cheerleading is an example of a sport that does that incredibly well.
We think that being able to give women a world in which they can define their own sexuality through their own motions in which they can subvert their set on the men's images of themselves as one can with such with cheerleading is really important.
And we think that if someone chooses to do cheerleading of their own volition for a long time like recognize that I think neither side of the house supports children who are forced into cheerleading believing that this is true for any kind of sport like my mother wouldn't, let me quit dancing for a really really long time, but that doesn't mean that I necessarily think that it was a bad like that we should stop dance all together.
But at the end, all our side advocates for is a world in which women can choose to do cheerleading and that a little bit like we don't understand why the government should be able to prevent that for these reasons, proud to oppose.
