I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that physical education should be mandatory.
First, just a quick overview on how you know the part and structure in this round works because generally speaking when we're talking about whether or not the government should not compel action by individuals on there's a couple standards that independently can be sufficient to justify that requirement.
So what I mean by this is that obviously the offline in this round is going to be something to the effect of well, you know, you're telling these kids that they got to do with thing and it's better when you allow them to make the choice because individuals are more capable of making choices for themselves than some of their party actor that's obviously a high standard that we hold up pretty high regard suit, generally speaking, then we have high bars that we meet to ensure that you know, that's not on that they did that the restriction is justified.
I see too when these are going to be my two independent points.
The first is if there is more or less objective, good given to the individual arm when you an active restriction on so, for example, restrictions that we put on our cigarettes for example, arm are more or less objective, and this is why we are justified in doing that I'm also why we can acquire academic on education in it beyond just physical education.
But secondly is when there's externalities that is, you know, also looking at cigarettes, something like second hand, smoke, something where we see that a person that didn't consented to the action is suffering consequences.
And as a result, we are justified in restricting it because you know your autonomy doesn't extend to violating other people's preferences on the first point that regarding objectivity, I think there's a pretty obvious case to be made in terms of, you know, the health benefits of engaging in physical education, especially when children are quite young, there says sirius need to ensure that they are physically active on this country's, obesity epidemic really underlines, how insufficient job we are doing our of meeting that standard, but do you know, just that small amount of physical activity day, you know, thirty minutes or whatever that really goes a long way in ensuring the child to long term physical well being without that physical education, there really isn't and meeting full check to ensure that they are doing that.
I think a lot of the kids that are getting their proper exercise of the type of kids that are usually fine with doing p anyway.
These are the more competitive kids, the more active ones I think, really what he's designed to do is to target the kids that aren't getting a sufficient amount of exercise on a daily basis because they're just not the type of the personality type that enjoys doing that on a regular basis, but it is still important to ensure that they get that fits kel education.
So the government probably is that man justified in mandating at all the second standard that regarding externalities, I think a lot of this folds into health care costs.
So this was also flouted a lot during the I sugary drinks debate around new york city, and what happens here is that when you have a substantial amount of people that are, you know not active enough, and by extension, then not healthy, their healthcare costs go up.
This is, you know, fairly clear why this would happen, you know that they are more likely to have physical illnesses are going to be making more doctors visits so on so forth, given that the odd the way the healthcare works essentially is based on a pool that is when one person's costs go up in order for them to be properly covered other people's cost also have to go up on an individual level.
This really doesn't make that big of a difference on a larger societal level when we are undergoing something like in your PC, the epidemic that has a really significant impact on healthcare costs, and in fact the united states now is one of the most expensive place up places to get health care in the world and a large factor in that is just the general on healthiness of this country.
I think that is justified to engage in tactics there's explicitly designed to improve the healthiness of individuals within this country when there are broader externalities on other people, people that have to pay more for health care because of on other people's, you know, health given that project hose.
