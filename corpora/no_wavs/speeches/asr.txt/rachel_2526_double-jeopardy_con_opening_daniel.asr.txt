The biggest problem that got us in this debate is that danny misunderstands what double jeopardy, actually it is what the legal definition connotes is that it is the same crime with the same evidence that a person is free, tried for what this means is that his entire first independent point that talks about what happens when they're new evidence appears when someone confesses all of this falls through, because with the addition of new evidence with the addition of a confession, the crime can be appealed and the case can be reopened.
We think that the point that there are significant systems in place that allow for the appeals process were allow for it for people to come out and confessed to their crimes, even after they have pled, not guilty.
And one means that double jeopardy exists as a protection for innocents against the over reach of the judicial system.
We think that one of the most used is one is an attempt to their punishments or where someone who's innocent down, and that is what we are talking about in this debate.
We think that everything that can be talked about is completely irrelevant at the point that you can always appeal the situation when new evidence comes out two main areas of clash, the first on the justice system and why we think preserving the fine now you've rulings is important.
We think the purpose of the justice system in trial by jury is to a value we killed innocents based on the people based on how your peers seen you put this means is that whether you are guilty or innocent isn't, just a fact claim but also depends on things like your situation and where you were at the time and the small amounts of bias he's with how people perceive them for example, something that might be perceived as first degree murder by some individuals can also be spun to look like something like self defense for others.
This is why we think that it's important that when we stand by a standard of trial by your peers, you stand by it to the end, you don't just get to switch out the peers at the end and try the trial over and over again until you get what you want as your result, rather the first time is important unless something changes because this is the standard, our legal system has sucked.
We also think this protects against things like court clog in providing closure.
We think the point that you could just read try every trial as many times as you want until you got a guilty verdict you'd, never stop re trying people danny says all, but we wouldn't want to do this, but I think he misunderstands the incentives to the judicial system elected judges, people who work for the d a's office, they want convictions and they want and they, but they often times go to many ends to get them.
We think that people who have money and have been victimized by others are often willing to spend that money trying in re trying trials because they want closure all of these kinds of things are all reasons as to why you would go on and re try people and keep them in jail, but more than this, we think that providing closure for victims as well as perpetrators is incredibly important.
We think that after that hearing that your trial is being retried all over again is an extra level of emotional suffering that someone just shouldn't have to go through more than once we think that when someone hears the guilty or not guilty verdict, this should be the end in so far as anything after that is just additional suffering and additional pain.
This works both for the victims in so far as now they have to listen and go through reliving that tried reliving their damaged experiences over and over, but also for the person who's accused insofar as there if they are innocent, they also have to live through this again.
Second, the we want to talk about protection of the innocence, because we think it's most important to keep those were innocent out of jail in so far as imprisoning, someone who's innocent is a rights violation on the part of the state and it's always worse than not imprisoning someone who is not innocent in so far as they have already committed their crime and no future rights violations are going to occur.
We think that allowing the court to have the systems that let them reach my innocence over and over again in order to wear them down because the d is so convinced that they are guilty, they will do anything regardless of the evidence is a problem because a lot of the time the DA or large corporations just have more money, and in order to stop being dragged into that courtroom, I will agree it to anything.
We also think that allowing courts to lay your punishment is also a problem in so far as you can try someone for the same crime over and over again and give them more and more years in jail for these reasons, proud to oppose.
