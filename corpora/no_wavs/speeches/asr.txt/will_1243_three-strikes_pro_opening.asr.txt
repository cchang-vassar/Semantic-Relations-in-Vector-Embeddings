I'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish three strikes laws, three, independent points.
The first being that these laws are fundamentally unfair.
The reason that we have protections for against cruel and unusual punishment in the united states, simple inmates despite having ghetto committed crimes still actually have rights that they are, you know, people who experience suffering and that when we can mitigate that suffering, we obviously should on this is, you know, fundamentally the reason that like we don't penalize like minor offenses with the death penalty that to some extent we want punishment to actually be proportionate to the crime we don't think the and that just because something is broadly classified as a felony that committing it three times justifies a life sentence, you know, something like robbery being classified as a felony, for example, doesn't mean that if I rob a convenience store, three times I'd just go to jail for the rest of my life, like I think it's some fundamental level, we just have to recognize that even if this does have a deterrent effect which I will address later as to why it most likely doesn't there just isn't a reasonable basis upon which we can say that this is a fair punishment and fairness is quite important in our criminal justice system.
We want a system that actually responds properly to the nature of the crime aid because those inmates do have rights but be because we want the perception that the state actually acts within the interests of its citizens at the end of the day, these inmates are still citizens of the united states or the state that they operate with them as such.
It seems fundamentally to be a breach of the social contract contract then to enforce draconian rules upon them.
Our second independent point is that this is just expensive system.
So when you increase penalties to such an incredible degree, you inevitably result in prison overcrowding on this is already a problem in california before the three strike laws, but the three strike law certainly have not helped that in fact, they have made it exceptionally exceptionally easier on to incarcerate individuals for prolonged amounts of time and then that generate significant expense to the state.
We think that this is a problem, not just because prison overcrowding in its own right as a right violation, which it is because that results in frequently resource deprivation and lack of personal space, but also because it puts the onerous burden on the taxpayer.
I think, really the only defensible wind that is often the kiddos touted by proponents of the three strikes law says that it cleans up the streets it makes it safer for non offenders.
The problem is that that in and of itself is just like a benefit to non offenders.
So if the trade off that is absurd, absurd waste of public money and taxpayer money, I don't think that the impact cochylis actually favors the three strike clause, even when only analyze from the perspective of non offenders, this is just a burden that you're putting on people armed for what is an unclear return, and that I'm clear return part leads me into my third and final point that the deterrence off factor of three strikes laws is unclear passed on a recent study.
Twenty twelve conducted at UC riverside found that there's actually very little reason to believe that the statistical decreasing crime in california had anything to do with the three strikes laws but actually rather with decreased alcohol consumption.
The reality is that we tend to look at the three strikes law is the driving factor in, you know, decreases in street crime, but the reality is that they're just significant other factors that can easily explain this and from a logical perspective, most felonies are committed in the heat of the moment, which is why it's unreasonable than to assume that stricter penalties and punishments are you meeting full deterrent against committing those crimes, even the opposite, all the rights violations, arguments put forward then it's just unclear what the benefits of this policy are if it doesn't do anything to medicate crime, proud to propose.
