internet centrist censorship
<Sync time="2.565"/>
should definitely not be increased .
<Sync time="5.080"/>
first to clarify the round
<Sync time="6.785"/>
we think that it's fine if individual forms in their sub laws say
<Sync time="10.725"/>
we will remove
<Sync time="11.920"/>
language that is hate speech language that is bullying
<Sync time="14.970"/>
this is what we do not tolerate in our forums .
<Sync time="17.250"/>
we think what this round deals with is specifically if the government
<Sync time="20.350"/>
is increasing internet sent-
<Sync time="22.265"/>
censorship and using their power to
<Sync time="25.025"/>
censor what people on the internet are saying .
<Sync time="27.700"/>
two main areas of three main areas of clash
<Sync time="30.370"/>
first on free speech and why it's violation occurs .
<Sync time="33.585"/>
we think that regardless of whether my speech is mean or derogatory
<Sync time="37.765"/>
unless i am calling to violence or actively higher
<Sync time="40.940"/>
harm
<Sync time="41.280"/>
i'm harming someone else it is protected .
<Sync time="44.210"/>
this is because
<Sync time="45.100"/>
speech is a away by which individuals
<Sync time="47.090"/>
actualize themselves
<Sync time="48.525"/>
and communicate themselves to the world .
<Sync time="51.320"/>
silencing them
<Sync time="52.380"/>
essentially means erasing their existence
<Sync time="54.900"/>
given that if no one knows my thoughts my feelings or my emotions
<Sync time="59.030"/>
then
<Sync time="59.425"/>
they cannot validate that i exist in the world 
<Sync time="62.175"/>
and have rights .
<Sync time="63.960"/>
so
<Sync time="64.460"/>
it is the same thing as me
<Sync time="66.260"/>
not being there .
<Sync time="67.800"/>
more than this though
<Sync time="68.985"/>
we think that a lot of the time the speech that one person might consider to be mean or an attack
<Sync time="74.750"/>
is speech that is valued by others . there is no
<Sync time="77.170"/>
universal standard by which we say
<Sync time="79.365"/>
this speech is valuable
<Sync time="81.150"/>
but this speech
<Sync time="82.070"/>
isn't because we think that when it currently %hes
<Sync time="84.920"/>
metric by a standard
<Sync time="86.645"/>
the black lives matter movement often uses
<Sync time="89.230"/>
is they like to say fuck white people or insult white people as a race .
<Sync time="93.265"/>
we think that this is probably acceptable given that this is
<Sync time="96.215"/>
in
<Sync time="96.640"/>
insinuation that talks about the like years of oppression that have occurred
<Sync time="100.910"/>
then is often used productively .
<Sync time="102.750"/>
the problem is that the same people that when the opposite occurs when someone says
<Sync time="107.185"/>
fuck black people
<Sync time="108.690"/>
this is something that would be considered hate speech and
<Sync time="111.685"/>
rightfully so
<Sync time="112.910"/>
should probably not exist .
<Sync time="114.670"/>
the issue is that it depends on who is in power .
<Sync time="117.500"/>
should you have a republican or a bunch of white supremacists in power
<Sync time="121.180"/>
they're much more likely to say it is
<Sync time="123.270"/>
fuck white people that ought be erased and censored
<Sync time="126.240"/>
not the opposite 
<Sync time="127.440"/>
that is okay .
<Sync time="128.680"/>
so 
<Sync time="129.510"/>
we think that in the end at the point that everyone is going to consider a different type of speech valuable
<Sync time="134.345"/>
and
<Sync time="134.820"/>
my speech is a way by which i relate to the world
<Sync time="137.390"/>
we think unless you're actively harming someone
<Sync time="139.660"/>
or calling to violence then that speech is protected .
<Sync time="143.190"/>
our second area of clash has to do with why we think it lends more growth to dangerous ideologies when you censor them .
<Sync time="149.210"/>
first we think that people use the internet as an outlet
<Sync time="152.035"/>
and
<Sync time="152.480"/>
because i can go on to this forum
<Sync time="154.360"/>
and yell all my racist thoughts i am much less likely to go into real life
<Sync time="158.520"/>
and shoot someone
<Sync time="160.290"/>
but also
<Sync time="161.025"/>
we think that the only way in which you can destroy these ideologies
<Sync time="164.500"/>
is by facing them head on and clashing with them .
<Sync time="167.025"/>
because if you can never point out the holes in a theory
<Sync time="170.040"/>
because you've banished it and not allowed it to enter the internet
<Sync time="173.240"/>
or the marketplace of ideas
<Sync time="175.260"/>
then the people who made it will still think they are right .
<Sync time="178.080"/>
the only way in which you can truly beat it down
<Sync time="180.830"/>
is if you are able to tell the rest of the world why they are incorrect
<Sync time="184.565"/>
and keep them from gaining popularity
<Sync time="186.680"/>
and followings .
<Sync time="188.110"/>
our third area of clash has to do with why it's open to government abuse .
<Sync time="191.760"/>
sure in an ultimate world where liberals are in charge then at least me and fellow liberals are happy .
<Sync time="197.205"/>
the problem is that the conservatives still aren't
<Sync time="199.520"/>
and we would say that this is still oppressive and abusive 
<Sync time="202.380"/>
of other people who have valid ideas .
<Sync time="204.845"/>
but recognize also
<Sync time="206.450"/>
that governments change over time .
<Sync time="208.470"/>
we think in a world where trump
<Sync time="210.250"/>
very recently got elected
<Sync time="211.805"/>
and the majority of both the senate and the house are republicans
<Sync time="215.400"/>
it is very possible that
<Sync time="217.305"/>
the ultra right does gain power
<Sync time="219.130"/>
and they change the standards in which we see .
<Sync time="221.280"/>
and suddenly the censorship isn't hate speech that i might consider hate speech
<Sync time="225.700"/>
and it isn't like the kinds of
<Sync time="227.910"/>
it isn't the kind of mean or bullying things that i might consider mean or bullying 
<Sync time="232.345"/>
but it flips the other direction
<Sync time="234.220"/>
it becomes censorship of liberal ideologies
<Sync time="237.250"/>
and censorship of progressive movements and protests .
<Sync time="241.320"/>
for these reasons proud to propose oppose .
<Sync time="245.180"/>
