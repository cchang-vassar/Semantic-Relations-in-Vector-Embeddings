school uniform
<Sync time="2.160"/>
are important because they help
<Sync time="3.900"/>
protect children that come from poor families
<Sync time="7.110"/>
and help them feel included
<Sync time="9.390"/>
in the school .
<Sync time="10.345"/>

<Sync time="10.870"/>
before i reach this argument ,
<Sync time="13.400"/>
allow me to respond to the points that were brought up by the prime minister .
<Sync time="17.635"/>

<Sync time="18.290"/>
so the first thing that was brought up is that
<Sync time="20.530"/>
school uniform
<Sync time="21.770"/>
stand in the way of the children to express their creativity and sense of individuality .
<Sync time="27.845"/>
two answers here .
<Sync time="29.340"/>
a : we simply disagree .
<Sync time="30.940"/>
we think that there are a million and one other ways in which
<Sync time="34.010"/>
you could stand out ,
<Sync time="35.820"/>
not through the tee shirt that you're wearing
<Sync time="38.560"/>
and children , specifically , usually have
<Sync time="41.015"/>
no
<Sync time="41.715"/>
problem
<Sync time="42.690"/>
finding such ways .
<Sync time="44.595"/>
you want to be creative and special ,
<Sync time="47.390"/>
go to art class ,
<Sync time="49.050"/>
go play the drums ,
<Sync time="50.430"/>
go do whatever it is that you want .
<Sync time="52.620"/>
nobody's going to stop you .
<Sync time="55.210"/>
second answer :
<Sync time="56.480"/>
we say that even if it is true to an extent ,
<Sync time="59.650"/>
we simply don't care
<Sync time="61.635"/>
too much
<Sync time="62.915"/>
about every kid
<Sync time="64.775"/>
getting to feel that he is the most special thing in the world .
<Sync time="68.910"/>
we say that if we show you
<Sync time="70.485"/>
that by canceling school uniform ,
<Sync time="72.790"/>
we're going to create a situation
<Sync time="74.790"/>
that will make it a lot harder for certain students
<Sync time="77.735"/>
to fit in and to feel welcome ,
<Sync time="80.090"/>
then with all due respect to the feeling of individuality of the children ,
<Sync time="84.680"/>
it can wait until
<Sync time="86.270"/>
after hour
<Sync time="87.530"/>
after school hours .
<Sync time="89.450"/>

<Sync time="90.540"/>
the second thing that we're being told is that
<Sync time="93.285"/>
school uniforms
<Sync time="94.660"/>
aren't comfortable enough .
<Sync time="96.330"/>
i'm sorry but this is not a serious argument . i mean ,
<Sync time="99.260"/>
come on .
<Sync time="100.210"/>
if this is the problem , we can easily solve it by
<Sync time="103.080"/>
allowing a few possible versions of the uniform , you know , short sleeve , long sleeve , etcetera ,
<Sync time="108.420"/>
and
<Sync time="109.075"/>
each student can simply choose
<Sync time="111.895"/>
the version that's most
<Sync time="113.570"/>
comfortable for him .
<Sync time="115.570"/>
jus- again , with all due respect , this is not
<Sync time="118.415"/>
so important .
<Sync time="121.610"/>
lastly , we hear that there is no positive impact that comes out of school uniform and that it's all just {asserjins/assertions} .
<Sync time="129.365"/>
but seeing as this
<Sync time="131.555"/>
was basically
<Sync time="133.330"/>
said as an assertion
<Sync time="135.210"/>
itself , without any analysis , i find it a
<Sync time="137.850"/>
little funny .
<Sync time="139.130"/>
so ,
<Sync time="139.655"/>
let's move on to explain the positive impact of uniform .
<Sync time="144.100"/>
we say that children can be pretty
<Sync time="146.365"/>
cruel sometimes ,
<Sync time="147.910"/>
especially to whoever is different from them .
<Sync time="150.360"/>
there are a few ways in which you can be different .
<Sync time="154.200"/>
it can be on the basis of appearance :
<Sync time="156.500"/>
if i am overweight , if the color of my skin is different ,
<Sync time="160.280"/>
it can be in my religion or my sexual orientation
<Sync time="164.480"/>
and ,
<Sync time="165.010"/>
obviously , it can be in
<Sync time="167.760"/>
socioeconomic status .
<Sync time="170.430"/>
if my parents don't have enough money to send me to school in
<Sync time="174.260"/>
fancy clothing
<Sync time="175.675"/>
like the rest of the children
<Sync time="177.510"/>
then , in the worst case scenario ,
<Sync time="179.960"/>
i might actually be subjected to social brook-
<Sync time="183.060"/>
preclusion .
<Sync time="184.095"/>
but even if not ,
<Sync time="185.950"/>
i start to develop a sense of inferiority .
<Sync time="189.880"/>
i feel
<Sync time="190.880"/>
uncomfortable in my own skin .
<Sync time="193.440"/>
this is a feeling that accompanies me
<Sync time="195.655"/>
everywhere , including into the classroom , and i just simply cannot run away from .
<Sync time="200.330"/>
we say that if it
<Sync time="201.435"/>
is possible to at least
<Sync time="203.740"/>
allow these children
<Sync time="206.060"/>
the chance of ,
<Sync time="208.455"/>
you know , getting free from all of this ,
<Sync time="211.260"/>
from this feeling of inferiority ,
<Sync time="213.370"/>
at least while they're in the school where they are supposed to be able to sit in the classroom and study and to
<Sync time="219.805"/>
focus and concentrate without feeling
<Sync time="222.365"/>
unwelcome , without having to worry about their social status .
<Sync time="226.280"/>
we say that if we could do something about it ,
<Sync time="228.920"/>
then this is something that we must do ,
<Sync time="231.090"/>
and by
<Sync time="232.120"/>
implementing the school uniform ,
<Sync time="234.660"/>
we say that at least
<Sync time="236.010"/>
we are giving them the chance
<Sync time="238.050"/>
of being released from all of this .
<Sync time="240.460"/>
therefore , we call you to oppose the motion .
<Sync time="243.412"/>
