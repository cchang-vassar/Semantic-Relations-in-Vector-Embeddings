<Sync time="0.580"/>
as much as the
<Sync time="2.880"/>
concept
<Sync time="3.965"/>
of creating a super national union for countries to promote the big goals and aims of trade and peace
<Sync time="12.330"/>
sounds appealing
<Sync time="13.640"/>
we must face reality 
<Sync time="15.360"/>
and be able to admit
<Sync time="17.690"/>
when such an organization
<Sync time="20.095"/>
is failing 
<Sync time="21.640"/>
and is no longer justifying the cost that's invested
<Sync time="25.040"/>
in it .
<Sync time="25.940"/>

<Sync time="26.790"/>
this union
<Sync time="27.980"/>
has been unsuccessful during the decades of its operation
<Sync time="32.095"/>
to bring about
<Sync time="34.045"/>
a significant rise
<Sync time="36.110"/>
either in growth or prosperity
<Sync time="38.090"/>
of the member countries .
<Sync time="40.335"/>
there are several reasons for that :
<Sync time="42.790"/>
the first one
<Sync time="43.735"/>
is vast cultural differences .
<Sync time="47.150"/>
if we look at the european union as an example for a
<Sync time="50.770"/>
super national organization that is
<Sync time="53.040"/>
a relatively successful
<Sync time="54.890"/>
then we could say that
<Sync time="56.920"/>
despite the obvious differences in culture there is still
<Sync time="60.580"/>
a common line between the countries that are like members
<Sync time="65.540"/>
of of the union .
<Sync time="66.625"/>
they are all democratic countries with
<Sync time="69.140"/>
a capitalist economy , 
<Sync time="71.820"/>
christianity is overwhelmingly the dominant religion in the union and so on .
<Sync time="76.890"/>
a- a- but when we look
<Sync time="78.605"/>
at the a_s_e_a_n
<Sync time="81.085"/>
we can clearly see that we are talking about a union between
<Sync time="85.705"/>
countries
<Sync time="86.710"/>
with
<Sync time="87.355"/>
a completely different nature .
<Sync time="89.875"/>

<Sync time="90.810"/>
democracies like the philippines alongside monarchies like thailand alongside
<Sync time="96.125"/>
um like
<Sync time="97.670"/>
military regimes in myanmar , communist regimes in laos
<Sync time="102.460"/>
or
<Sync time="103.195"/>
autocratic
<Sync time="104.470"/>
regimes in singapore .
<Sync time="106.620"/>
there is not even one dominant religion . we have christianity , we have islam , we have buddhism .
<Sync time="112.105"/>
so
<Sync time="112.805"/>
in short we say that it is very difficult
<Sync time="115.780"/>
to create a true mutual ground ,
<Sync time="118.390"/>
mutual language , this way and
<Sync time="120.925"/>
like
<Sync time="121.545"/>
to establish
<Sync time="123.435"/>
real cooperation .
<Sync time="125.680"/>
second reason is very unstable economies .
<Sync time="129.870"/>
if there is anything that we've learned 
<Sync time="131.790"/>
from looking at the difficulties that the european union is facing
<Sync time="137.080"/>
is that the effect of weak
<Sync time="139.130"/>
countries on the verge of collapsing
<Sync time="141.540"/>
um like
<Sync time="142.840"/>
weak member states that are on the verge of collapse or that
<Sync time="145.900"/>
actually do collapse
<Sync time="147.510"/>
means trouble
<Sync time="148.675"/>
for the entire union and it takes
<Sync time="151.475"/>
huge investments of huge sums of money
<Sync time="154.570"/>
in attempts to save these member states from
<Sync time="157.645"/>
bankruptcy .
<Sync time="158.940"/>
and
<Sync time="159.810"/>
with all due respect for
<Sync time="162.620"/>
the
<Sync time="163.490"/>
hardship
<Sync time="164.535"/>
that the greek economy
<Sync time="166.835"/>
is facing
<Sync time="168.700"/>
we believe that there is no way to compare it to the economies of countries such as cambodia or thailand
<Sync time="176.090"/>
that are in much worse shape .
<Sync time="178.340"/>
so
<Sync time="179.110"/>
creating a
<Sync time="180.595"/>
trade zone between rich countries like singapore
<Sync time="183.800"/>
and
<Sync time="184.300"/>
poor countries like thailand or cambodia
<Sync time="187.810"/>
um
<Sync time="188.255"/>
brings to a complete dependency
<Sync time="191.120"/>
of the poorer countries
<Sync time="192.760"/>
upon the richer countries .
<Sync time="194.650"/>
this dependency creates conflicts and much resentment even
<Sync time="198.600"/>
and it might have the opposite effect of what we actually want to achieve
<Sync time="203.270"/>
on trade
<Sync time="204.130"/>
on exporting and importing because
<Sync time="206.595"/>
the relations between the countries
<Sync time="208.420"/>
are getting tense
<Sync time="209.680"/>
and so this might have an
<Sync time="211.540"/>
an negative effect
<Sync time="213.145"/>
on trade and it might do more harm than good
<Sync time="216.070"/>
on that respect .
<Sync time="217.120"/>
and so it seems that not only the history of this organization teaches us that it's not particularly successful
<Sync time="223.425"/>
but we also have
<Sync time="224.710"/>
a few structural reasons to believe that no significant change
<Sync time="228.570"/>
is seen in the near future .
<Sync time="230.830"/>
maintaining such an organization
<Sync time="232.850"/>
costs huge sums of money we have to
<Sync time="235.670"/>
like
<Sync time="236.250"/>
occupy buildings and pay salaries
<Sync time="238.860"/>
and conduct summits in signed treaties
<Sync time="241.860"/>
this is a lot of investment
<Sync time="244.140"/>
that goes out
<Sync time="245.160"/>
without achieving anything . it is
<Sync time="247.825"/>
a shame
<Sync time="248.800"/>
basically
<Sync time="249.770"/>
and so we support the disbanding
<Sync time="252.530"/>
of the a_s_e_a_n
<Sync time="255.464"/>
