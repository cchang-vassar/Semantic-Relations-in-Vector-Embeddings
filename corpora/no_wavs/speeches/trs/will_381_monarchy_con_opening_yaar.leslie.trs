i am proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should abolish monarchies .
<Sync time="5.060"/>
before getting into my independent points , i'd like to offer a small bit of clarification .
<Sync time="9.435"/>
for the purposes of {dis/this} debate ,
<Sync time="11.415"/>
i will refer to
<Sync time="12.580"/>
monarchies like the u_k
<Sync time="14.165"/>
as weak monarchies . these are monarchies where there's not a lot of
<Sync time="17.415"/>
central power-making , %hes
<Sync time="19.205"/>
decision-making rather ,
<Sync time="20.930"/>
given to the monarch .
<Sync time="22.860"/>
um i will refer to sir-
<Sync time="24.870"/>
strong monarchies uh as well ,
<Sync time="27.610"/>
meaning
<Sync time="28.560"/>
countries like saudi arabia , countries like qatar , where the monarch
<Sync time="31.470"/>
actually has decision-making power that is more or less absolute over the entire country .
<Sync time="36.710"/>
with that ,
<Sync time="37.390"/>
two independent points . the first is that monarchies
<Sync time="40.140"/>
afford stability .
<Sync time="41.720"/>
i think this plays out in very different ways between weak and strong
<Sync time="44.560"/>
monarchies . in weak monarchies ,
<Sync time="46.770"/>
this is through a sense of morale .
<Sync time="48.420"/>
this is , as gov admits , a
<Sync time="50.760"/>
cultural point of the country ,
<Sync time="52.740"/>
but i think it's notable that it's not just a historical thing , that this isn't just something that is ,
<Sync time="57.595"/>
" oh well , this was part of our history ,
<Sync time="59.690"/>
so we should just continue doing it for the sake of preserving our history . "
<Sync time="63.360"/>
i don't think that's what it is .
<Sync time="64.580"/>
i think it has a modern-day value ,
<Sync time="66.730"/>
that there is this sense of confidence established in your government ,
<Sync time="69.930"/>
by some sort of central figure ,
<Sync time="71.650"/>
that is often above the fray of politics and above the petty infighting .
<Sync time="75.355"/>
and as such ,
<Sync time="76.165"/>
it allows people to have a significant amount of confidence in their government .
<Sync time="80.115"/>
i think you can see this in the u_k
<Sync time="81.940"/>
where , even if there's a lot of
<Sync time="83.695"/>
%hes attention between tories and the labour party ,
<Sync time="86.620"/>
you're still going to see a lot of confidence in the queen .
<Sync time="89.370"/>
that's important ,
<Sync time="90.335"/>
because it means that people have a sense of confidence in their government , that they
<Sync time="93.885"/>
feel secure with the country that they're living in ,
<Sync time="96.140"/>
that they are happy in this place ,
<Sync time="97.900"/>
and as a result that they are confident that their government is working to do things that will assist them .
<Sync time="102.690"/>
that peace of mind is valuable ,
<Sync time="104.550"/>
but it's also valuable in mitigating the amount of vitriol that is present in politics .
<Sync time="108.900"/>
look to the united states as an example of when this can get
<Sync time="111.525"/>
extremely out of hand ,
<Sync time="113.270"/>
that without that mitigating force ,
<Sync time="115.150"/>
things can get outright dangerous , through things like
<Sync time="117.690"/>
acts of violence {crip--petuated/perpetuated}
<Sync time="119.080"/>

<Sync time="119.825"/>
by members of particular parties . and as a result of that , we think that the monarchy is a reasonable tradeoff .
<Sync time="125.660"/>
but even looking at strong dramocra- %hes monarchies ,
<Sync time="128.485"/>
i think there is still
<Sync time="129.505"/>
incredible value the pr- in the stability provided there .
<Sync time="132.785"/>
for one thing ,
<Sync time="133.745"/>
there isn't uncertainty in decision-making po- pow-
<Sync time="136.505"/>
po- uh
<Sync time="137.220"/>
decision-making
<Sync time="138.860"/>
patterns .
<Sync time="139.660"/>
when you look to something like the united states ,
<Sync time="142.070"/>
there's a lot of fluctuation between
<Sync time="144.165"/>
what's happening on one day or %hes in one election cycle or another .
<Sync time="148.080"/>
over the course of two years ,
<Sync time="149.770"/>
the landscape of who's running the country can shift
<Sync time="152.100"/>
drastically , and that has extreme implications on our foreign policy , on our domestic policy ,
<Sync time="157.480"/>
on the way people feel about their government .
<Sync time="159.550"/>
that instability is a problem .
<Sync time="161.990"/>
but secondly ,
<Sync time="162.820"/>
it mitigates power cycles . so , what i mean by this
<Sync time="166.190"/>
is that
<Sync time="167.015"/>
in democracies , there are often lots of conflicting forces
<Sync time="170.090"/>
based on electoral incentives
<Sync time="171.780"/>
that compel actors to act in ways that they don't actually think is reasonable .
<Sync time="176.070"/>
a lot of policy makers , for example ,
<Sync time="178.200"/>
will pursue things like %hes
<Sync time="180.540"/>
unreasonable
<Sync time="181.590"/>
protections for gun owners , or
<Sync time="183.465"/>
ridiculous health care policies , or
<Sync time="185.735"/>
an- any number of things that people do genuinely understand are bad ideas ,
<Sync time="190.415"/>
but they have electoral incentives ,
<Sync time="192.380"/>
driven by people that don't understand the policies very well ,
<Sync time="195.610"/>
to make bad decisions .
<Sync time="197.270"/>
this isn't true for monarchies .
<Sync time="199.200"/>
they don't have to act in this way . they don't have to be accountable to individuals that aren't understanding of the ways in which governments work .
<Sync time="206.155"/>
but furthermore ,
<Sync time="207.445"/>
they don't have to worry about things like lobbyists ,
<Sync time="210.030"/>
because they're above that fray .
<Sync time="211.630"/>
they don't have to worry about their campaign coffers
<Sync time="214.055"/>
and as a result ,
<Sync time="214.960"/>
monied interests
<Sync time="215.950"/>
don't affect them .
<Sync time="217.470"/>
our second independent briefly
<Sync time="219.290"/>
independent point briefly
<Sync time="220.760"/>
is that the means by which you would achieve abolishing monarchies are questionable .
<Sync time="224.460"/>
this isn't going to happen voluntarily ,
<Sync time="226.740"/>
so i think really the only way they can accomplish this is with some sort of violent revolution .
<Sync time="231.030"/>
generally speaking , these cause a lot of suffering and a lot of pain .
<Sync time="234.820"/>
i think even if you buy that ,
<Sync time="236.320"/>
on net ,
<Sync time="237.090"/>
the arguments brought forward by gov are slightly preferable ,
<Sync time="240.620"/>
something like the current civil war in syria ,
<Sync time="243.290"/>
i think that amount of suffering makes it not worth the transition into a slightly better form of government ,
<Sync time="248.490"/>
even if you buy that it is better . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="252.328"/>
