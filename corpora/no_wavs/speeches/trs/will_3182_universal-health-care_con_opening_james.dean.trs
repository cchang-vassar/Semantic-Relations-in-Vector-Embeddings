i'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should guarantee universal health care .
<Sync time="6.200"/>
our first independent point is that
<Sync time="8.410"/>
guaranteeing universal healthcare
<Sync time="10.330"/>
is particularly expensive and creates a significant drag on government coffers .
<Sync time="15.830"/>
the united states is a good example of this
<Sync time="18.570"/>
where
<Sync time="19.550"/>
already eventhough we're not even covering everybody
<Sync time="22.770"/>
a significant portion of our country's spending
<Sync time="25.865"/>
is sunk into uh
<Sync time="27.885"/>
health care costs things like medicare and medicaid .
<Sync time="31.050"/>
this isn't a cheap thing to provide for people
<Sync time="34.190"/>
and one of the fundamental reasons for it
<Sync time="37.010"/>
is that the more coverage is sponsored by the government
<Sync time="40.270"/>
the more of the healthcare costs .
<Sync time="42.670"/>
the reason for this is a
<Sync time="44.810"/>
um
<Sync time="45.450"/>
what's called a a principal agent issue
<Sync time="47.765"/>
that is when the person who's paying for the good
<Sync time="51.080"/>
isn't the person who benefits for the good .
<Sync time="53.930"/>
there's a problem both in terms of the quality of the good provided
<Sync time="57.540"/>
but also in terms of the incentive of payment .
<Sync time="60.515"/>
the united states government faces political pressure to make payments
<Sync time="65.190"/>
regardless of what the quality of the care provided is
<Sync time="68.130"/>
as such then
<Sync time="69.595"/>
they are often going to pay
<Sync time="71.520"/>
increasing amounts of money
<Sync time="73.145"/>
for the same costs .
<Sync time="74.900"/>
this is a problem
<Sync time="76.065"/>
because the money that the united states government pays doesn't come from like thin
<Sync time="80.000"/>
air
<Sync time="80.540"/>
it comes from the government's coffers
<Sync time="82.635"/>
and this is money that can easily be reallocated to more effective uses of capital
<Sync time="87.380"/>
while healthcare is a facilitative right
<Sync time="89.640"/>
other things like housing and food are also facilitative rights
<Sync time="94.005"/>
so we think at the point where the government has to make
<Sync time="96.220"/>
active decisions on what it's going to spend its money on
<Sync time="99.370"/>
we think that it is better for the government to spend money on something like housing programs or
<Sync time="104.010"/>
snap benefits
<Sync time="105.270"/>
which will ensure that facilitative rights are still being met
<Sync time="108.490"/>
but it will do so in a way that doesn't actually create ballooning costs within that industry .
<Sync time="114.120"/>
our second independent point
<Sync time="115.850"/>
is that there is a need to consent
<Sync time="117.960"/>
out and we think this is a fundamental right .
<Sync time="120.555"/>
um
<Sync time="121.140"/>
we think the people should specifically have the right to consent out of healthcare .
<Sync time="124.560"/>
this is an informed decision that is that
<Sync time="127.285"/>
people often will make it
<Sync time="128.825"/>
a conscious decision about whether or not healthcare is a smart bennett
<Sync time="131.865"/>
is a smart investment for them
<Sync time="133.650"/>
and we think particularly younger people often see that they are quite healthy
<Sync time="138.430"/>
and not in need of paying a significant portion of their income towards health care
<Sync time="142.650"/>
rather they would rather just keep the money
<Sync time="145.310"/>
and
<Sync time="145.940"/>
given that the chance of them needing to go to the hospitals quite small spend on other important things like food
<Sync time="151.210"/>
and shelter .
<Sync time="152.055"/>
the issue though
<Sync time="153.745"/>
is that if universal healthcare is guaranteed
<Sync time="156.580"/>
even if there's an opt out capacity
<Sync time="158.910"/>
um %hes
<Sync time="160.280"/>
there can't be an opt out capacity
<Sync time="162.400"/>
you need something like what the united states on obamacare an individual mandate
<Sync time="167.010"/>
to ensure that the system will operate
<Sync time="169.080"/>
because the functional nature of health care uh
<Sync time="172.060"/>
pools
<Sync time="172.910"/>
is that you
<Sync time="173.680"/>
balloon up the costs that are going to be created by the sick people
<Sync time="177.550"/>
by having the healthy people pay into it .
<Sync time="180.035"/>
this is a problem then
<Sync time="181.650"/>
because if we find that individuals have a right to consent out of this product and make the active decision
<Sync time="186.935"/>
that they're not going to sink their money into something that they don't need
<Sync time="190.510"/>
than the system fails .
<Sync time="192.010"/>
either you engage in mass rights violations
<Sync time="194.745"/>
or you just have a failing health care system .
<Sync time="197.940"/>
either way this is significantly worse than the status quo .
<Sync time="201.390"/>

<Sync time="202.040"/>
our third independent point
<Sync time="203.600"/>
is that providing universal healthcare
<Sync time="205.730"/>
is redistributive economics and
<Sync time="207.820"/>
those are bad .
<Sync time="209.140"/>
so
<Sync time="209.845"/>
specifically what we mean
<Sync time="211.580"/>
is that how the providing universal healthcare
<Sync time="214.210"/>
at the point where most wealthy people already have health care anyway
<Sync time="217.990"/>
involves taking money from wealthier individuals and putting it into public social spending programs
<Sync time="223.885"/>
that will then be reallocated to poorer individuals .
<Sync time="226.745"/>
the problem with this
<Sync time="228.175"/>
is that wealthy individuals
<Sync time="229.830"/>
have a rights claim to their property that is the capital that is then being taxed in then reinvested into poor individuals .
<Sync time="236.995"/>
we think that quite often they
<Sync time="238.790"/>
earned this money giving them a particular deserve claim to it
<Sync time="242.360"/>
but
<Sync time="242.825"/>
beyond this we think that it is also a fundamental violation of one's property rights to take their property from them forcefully .
<Sync time="249.895"/>
this in turn
<Sync time="251.220"/>
is a significant abuse on the part of the government . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="255.100"/>
