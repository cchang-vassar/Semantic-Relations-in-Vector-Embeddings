<Sync time="0.540"/>
we should close the guantanamo bay detention camp .
<Sync time="4.040"/>
so , we want to be clear about how we think this is going to occur .
<Sync time="7.380"/>
uh there are still uh
<Sync time="8.945"/>
dozens of the individuals that are uh
<Sync time="11.085"/>
that are interned in guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="13.715"/>
and we're going to have two main prongs to our model .
<Sync time="16.575"/>
the first is that
<Sync time="17.645"/>
if trials are possible , if there's enough evidence that someone could even feasibly go to trial ,
<Sync time="22.360"/>
we would put these people on trial , we would do this
<Sync time="24.740"/>
in a civilian rather than
<Sync time="26.390"/>
uh a military court , because we think there are
<Sync time="29.060"/>
there's more openness , there's more opportunity for people to get a fair defense in the civilian court ,
<Sync time="33.690"/>
and therefore we think that this is only just , especially given that these individuals are for the most part
<Sync time="38.050"/>
not military members .
<Sync time="39.290"/>
and secondly ,
<Sync time="40.170"/>
if there isn't enough evidence to even bring these individuals to trial ,
<Sync time="43.680"/>
we would say uh
<Sync time="44.800"/>
that they would just be returned to their homes , will be uh
<Sync time="47.880"/>
given ba- will be put back into their home country
<Sync time="50.540"/>
and uh
<Sync time="51.355"/>
they would be allowed to go free . ok .
<Sync time="53.400"/>
two main arguments . the first is on morality ,
<Sync time="55.635"/>
and the second is on legalism and international relations . so on morality .
<Sync time="59.390"/>
we think that most prisoners in guantanamo bay are currently held
<Sync time="62.670"/>
without substantial evidence
<Sync time="64.430"/>
to charge them ,
<Sync time="65.455"/>
or any sort
<Sync time="66.440"/>
of real reason that they are in there . they didn't deserve the internment that they're currently experiencing ,
<Sync time="71.700"/>
and on top of the fact that they are being detained ,
<Sync time="74.300"/>
which in and of itself is unjust , the conditions of their detainment
<Sync time="77.720"/>
is simply
<Sync time="78.585"/>
uh inhumane and what this means is that people are denied
<Sync time="81.665"/>
basic human rights , and are given
<Sync time="83.540"/>
are subject to things such as torture
<Sync time="85.890"/>
that go against
<Sync time="87.140"/>
major international law , and go against our fundamental moral code . we think that , from a deontological framework ,
<Sync time="93.330"/>
human beings are not deserving of this kind of inhumane treatment , and this can be seen as codified
<Sync time="98.140"/>
in liberal democracies across the world .
<Sync time="100.115"/>
and even if you want to take on a utilitarian framework
<Sync time="103.125"/>
of morality ,
<Sync time="104.330"/>
torture is shown time and again to be
<Sync time="106.665"/>
an
<Sync time="107.130"/>
ineffective means of getting information from people ,
<Sync time="110.330"/>
of getting information that could stop terrorist attacks or things of this nature ,
<Sync time="114.000"/>
and given that there's no real gain to torturing and detaining these individuals
<Sync time="118.190"/>
in this prison , we don't think that there's any sort of moral justification
<Sync time="122.020"/>
to leave them
<Sync time="122.960"/>
interned . uh
<Sync time="124.360"/>
but the second thing we want talk about is the international relations
<Sync time="127.610"/>
surrounding guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="129.030"/>
and why it's so problematic for the united states . so 
<Sync time="131.490"/>
firstly , the united states ,
<Sync time="133.400"/>
over its history , has constructed
<Sync time="135.200"/>
a large amount of the current international law
<Sync time="137.860"/>
such uh
<Sync time="138.365"/>
that exists in the world , such as the geneva conventions
<Sync time="141.260"/>
and certain human rights conventions that
<Sync time="143.375"/>
have been signed onto by the united states .
<Sync time="145.820"/>
we would say that
<Sync time="146.790"/>
in a world in which guantanamo bay exists ,
<Sync time="149.300"/>
the united states
<Sync time="150.290"/>
loses the moral high ground that allows it to enforce those international laws . it means that
<Sync time="155.070"/>
when american citizens and american civilians
<Sync time="158.000"/>
are detained by states that these people are subject to torture 
<Sync time="161.655"/>
and are subject to poor treatment
<Sync time="163.390"/>
by these states , and this means that
<Sync time="165.470"/>
in having guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="167.270"/>
without any sort of positive gains from it ,
<Sync time="169.320"/>
it puts americans at risk of the h-
<Sync time="171.795"/>
inhumane treatment that we cause to others . it also angers
<Sync time="175.070"/>
many people in the international world
<Sync time="177.125"/>
uh
<Sync time="177.860"/>
from individuals %hes from individual countries in europe , which if you are a human rights treatment
<Sync time="182.660"/>
is abhorrent ,
<Sync time="183.640"/>
to middle eastern and north african countries
<Sync time="185.870"/>
whose citizens are subject to detainment in guantanamo bay .
<Sync time="189.130"/>
this means that in that individual countries are less likely to want to work with the united states
<Sync time="193.555"/>
in the international sphere ,
<Sync time="195.105"/>
and it means the united states loses much of its standing
<Sync time="198.010"/>
abroad .
<Sync time="198.780"/>
finally , we think that
<Sync time="200.090"/>
guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="201.070"/>
for the most part , serves as propaganda
<Sync time="203.560"/>
for terror cells
<Sync time="204.800"/>
in the status quo . terrorists can point to guantanamo bay
<Sync time="208.130"/>
to show that this the united states
<Sync time="210.280"/>
doesn't care about human rights , it doesn't care about civilians
<Sync time="213.145"/>
that aren't their own civilians ,
<Sync time="214.695"/>
and they can paint the united states as this great evil ,
<Sync time="217.215"/>
and show the factual evidence of guantanamo bay
<Sync time="220.150"/>
as a site where torture routinely takes place and human rights
<Sync time="223.190"/>
are routinely ignored .
<Sync time="224.760"/>
given that it causes
<Sync time="225.770"/>
immense international harms , and that morally
<Sync time="228.255"/>
guantanamo bay is repugnant and unjustifiable ,
<Sync time="231.240"/>
we should close the guantanamo bay detention camp .
<Sync time="234.160"/>
