the alternatives to banning trans fat
<Sync time="3.290"/>
are exactly the kinds of education that yaar says don't work .
<Sync time="7.380"/>
things like
<Sync time="8.020"/>
ad campaigns and targeted grants that
<Sync time="10.625"/>
allow schools to have better health classes
<Sync time="13.600"/>
and more recess times .
<Sync time="15.410"/>
things like that
<Sync time="16.540"/>
unlike what yaar
<Sync time="17.620"/>
posits are incredibly useful
<Sync time="19.750"/>
and we see that they've been very effective
<Sync time="21.750"/>
in things like decreasing the use of cigarettes
<Sync time="23.990"/>
where something like
<Sync time="25.270"/>
eighty percent less people smoke cigarettes now
<Sync time="28.210"/>
than
<Sync time="28.665"/>
even five years ago did .
<Sync time="31.240"/>
it's incredibly important to notice
<Sync time="32.985"/>
that these kinds of thin- that think that
<Sync time="35.320"/>
simple information can
<Sync time="37.110"/>
easily allow people to be more educated about the decisions that they're making
<Sync time="41.210"/>
and allow them to make better decisions
<Sync time="42.980"/>
without
<Sync time="43.480"/>
banning their options through the government .
<Sync time="46.080"/>
two main areas of clash .
<Sync time="47.460"/>
first on why the standards for intervention
<Sync time="49.750"/>
aren't met .
<Sync time="50.930"/>
unless government is also going to ban sugar ,
<Sync time="53.900"/>
caffeine , or any other
<Sync time="55.855"/>
addictive food additive
<Sync time="57.900"/>
then
<Sync time="58.340"/>
they cannot ban then they cannot rightfully been trans fat .
<Sync time="62.200"/>
it is agreed by both sides of the house
<Sync time="64.980"/>
that you could intervene when something is distinctly harmful
<Sync time="67.970"/>
but government never proved somehow
<Sync time="70.190"/>
that trans fat
<Sync time="71.050"/>
was distinct
<Sync time="72.215"/>
because
<Sync time="72.975"/>
it's not more harmful than those examples i just listed .
<Sync time="76.900"/>
we think that in order to preserve democracy , the government needs to be as least restrictive as possible
<Sync time="81.800"/>
and provide as much autonomy over their decisions to the individual
<Sync time="85.000"/>
as they can .
<Sync time="86.640"/>
this means giving the right for people
<Sync time="88.510"/>
to make harmful decisions sometimes
<Sync time="90.670"/>
and unlike hard drugs ,
<Sync time="92.140"/>
trans fat is less addictive
<Sync time="93.900"/>
and less immediately damaging than things like heroin .
<Sync time="96.680"/>
like it is much easier for someone
<Sync time="98.525"/>
to be fully informed about the harms and change their diet
<Sync time="101.320"/>
than it is to tell a drug addict this drug is bad for you
<Sync time="104.090"/>
because those kind of chemicals in the brain
<Sync time="106.360"/>
information just can't fight .
<Sync time="108.075"/>
so basically at the wa-
<Sync time="109.510"/>
point that we've proven to you that this is not
<Sync time="111.760"/>
more distinct than any other kind of mildly addicting food additive
<Sync time="116.035"/>
and that we pr- and that it is
<Sync time="118.460"/>
um
<Sync time="119.025"/>
and that it is not nearly as harmful as things that we currently have banned ,
<Sync time="122.615"/>
we don't think that government has met the necessary standards in order to ban this in the first place .
<Sync time="127.260"/>
but in case you don't buy that ,
<Sync time="128.680"/>
let's talk about the harms .
<Sync time="130.110"/>
our second are of clash has to do with exactly
<Sync time="132.790"/>
how much tra- banning trans fat
<Sync time="134.985"/>
would change the lives of specific individuals in a bad way
<Sync time="138.310"/>
because
<Sync time="138.920"/>
recognize that the kind of food that uses trans fat
<Sync time="141.830"/>
is oftentimes things that are cheaper .
<Sync time="144.040"/>
fast food restaurants are heavy users of trans fat
<Sync time="147.090"/>
uh any sort of like frozen good ,
<Sync time="149.205"/>
t_v dinners .
<Sync time="150.310"/>
these are the like kind of groups that use trans fat because it is so cheap
<Sync time="153.760"/>
and is so easily mass produced
<Sync time="155.750"/>
and so easily used as a preservative .
<Sync time="158.410"/>
what this means is that the people who rely on this kind of food
<Sync time="161.440"/>
are those who usually don't have the economic means to eat better ,
<Sync time="164.670"/>
because you sure as hell aren't going to see a rich person
<Sync time="167.580"/>
chomping on mcdonald's all day
<Sync time="169.260"/>
because they know that it's bad for their bodies
<Sync time="171.185"/>
and they have the money to choose an alternative .
<Sync time="173.370"/>
so all that government is doing is targeting people who already don't have the means
<Sync time="177.525"/>
and saying that
<Sync time="178.340"/>
because we decided this is so bad for you
<Sync time="180.980"/>
we prefer for you do not have enough food at all .
<Sync time="183.570"/>
while opposition prevers-
<Sync time="185.280"/>
prefers that you eat something less healthy
<Sync time="187.850"/>
as opposed to just not having enough to eat in
<Sync time="190.150"/>
first place
<Sync time="190.955"/>
because
<Sync time="191.560"/>
we think that it's much worse for children to not have a meal
<Sync time="195.185"/>
than it is
<Sync time="196.255"/>
for them to have something that is less healthy but at least they can still
<Sync time="199.605"/>
function that day , they can still learn normally .
<Sync time="202.320"/>
recognize that being hungry
<Sync time="204.260"/>
detracts from a lot of productive abilities .
<Sync time="206.570"/>
so if i didn't eat dinner that night ,
<Sync time="208.370"/>
i'm not going to be able to focus in school the next day .
<Sync time="210.910"/>
more than this though , we think this is a band aid on the obesity epidemic
<Sync time="214.740"/>
because people can still get fat
<Sync time="216.900"/>
off of unhealthy foods
<Sync time="218.420"/>
without trans fat being included
<Sync time="220.440"/>
but if you're using all of your political will to change the laws around banning trans fat ,
<Sync time="225.320"/>
you're necessarily not targeting
<Sync time="226.990"/>
these kinds of problems at the core .
<Sync time="228.870"/>
you need to
<Sync time="229.410"/>
encourage people to be able to make healthy decisions
<Sync time="232.030"/>
regardless of what the options before them are .
<Sync time="234.335"/>
you can't just take away their options
<Sync time="236.610"/>
because in the end you're not going to be able to ban all kinds of unhealthy food .
<Sync time="240.650"/>
you need to be able to teach people to choose between something healthy and unhealthy
<Sync time="244.750"/>
and choose the healthy one
<Sync time="245.920"/>
even though the unhealthy one tastes better . for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="251.370"/>
