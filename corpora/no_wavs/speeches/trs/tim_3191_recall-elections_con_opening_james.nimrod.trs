<Sync time="0.945"/>
we should not introduce recall elections .
<Sync time="3.920"/>
so ,
<Sync time="4.515"/>
we think that the problem with recall elections broadly
<Sync time="7.275"/>
is that they allow for people
<Sync time="9.045"/>
to remove individuals from political office , when politics is es- is essentially and apparently a long game . what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="16.055"/>
it's very difficult to gauge political decisions in the short term ,
<Sync time="19.600"/>
because the ramifications often appear
<Sync time="21.610"/>
in the long term , and it's very difficult for people to internalize those things ,
<Sync time="24.965"/>
for example when
<Sync time="26.465"/>
congress chooses to pass one budget over another ,
<Sync time="29.370"/>
it's hard to internalize , and to see the ramifications of those
<Sync time="32.685"/>
minute differences , or sometimes very drastic differences ,
<Sync time="36.060"/>
for a number of- for a very long period of time , because bureaucracy
<Sync time="39.380"/>
change the amount of time that
<Sync time="40.825"/>
people are able to adopt certain policies , there's a- there's a many- a wide variety of metrics
<Sync time="45.525"/>
that could be at play ,
<Sync time="46.630"/>
and therefore we think it's irresponsible for voters
<Sync time="49.645"/>
to remove someone from political office
<Sync time="51.740"/>
in the middle of their term . we think it simply
<Sync time="54.265"/>
is not fair .
<Sync time="55.550"/>
we think that people have immensely
<Sync time="57.480"/>
limited information ,
<Sync time="59.010"/>
generally , and that politicians often have vastly more information
<Sync time="62.365"/>
than individuals do , especially in regards to interests
<Sync time="65.340"/>
that concern national security ,
<Sync time="67.330"/>
particular legal interests , or business interests ,
<Sync time="69.690"/>
we think these are instances , in which
<Sync time="71.155"/>
individuals or the public at large is very bad at making decisions ,
<Sync time="75.175"/>
and that we shouldn't trust our politicians
<Sync time="77.210"/>
to make these decisions for us . we think that recall elections
<Sync time="80.240"/>
lead to a number of very bad scenarios . the first
<Sync time="83.230"/>
is that we think there's
<Sync time="84.565"/>
immense pressure to appeal to populists , because populists are often the people that vote
<Sync time="88.910"/>
in niche election , so non
<Sync time="90.805"/>
presidential elections , and if there was to be a recall election ,
<Sync time="94.140"/>
populists and popular supporters ,
<Sync time="96.165"/>
the most fervent supporters and %hes
<Sync time="98.245"/>
in a district , the most fervent advocates ,
<Sync time="100.210"/>
are likely to be the ones
<Sync time="101.885"/>
that end up going to that recall election , and therefore
<Sync time="104.395"/>
politicians need to be cognizant of those people ,
<Sync time="107.000"/>
and play to their interests ,
<Sync time="108.740"/>
even when
<Sync time="109.640"/>
information goes against the interests
<Sync time="111.835"/>
of those individuals , because those individuals are just like everyone else in society ,
<Sync time="115.760"/>
and are not privy to the special information that politicians do .
<Sync time="118.785"/>
we think this makes it impossible uh
<Sync time="120.720"/>
we think that it means that politicians are more likely to be on a tight leash ,
<Sync time="124.220"/>
um and it makes them less likely to do a couple of things : first ,
<Sync time="126.870"/>
it's less likely to let them go against their party , and we think
<Sync time="129.600"/>
given the immense amount of partisan gridlock , that exists
<Sync time="132.280"/>
in our current political systems ,
<Sync time="133.920"/>
it would be preferable if politicians
<Sync time="135.630"/>
didn't fear backlash from their party ,
<Sync time="137.670"/>
especially in a recall election .
<Sync time="139.380"/>
second , we think it's less likely that individuals are likely
<Sync time="142.070"/>
to introduce controversial but important bills , because
<Sync time="145.245"/>
whereas certain times
<Sync time="146.670"/>
whereas in the status quo , bills
<Sync time="148.275"/>
are- can be passed and play out over a long period of time , and you can see the ramifications to the-
<Sync time="153.240"/>
ramifications of those bills ,
<Sync time="155.590"/>
that same amount of time isn't given to people , when you have recall elections ,
<Sync time="159.350"/>
as a threat to repu-
<Sync time="160.540"/>
repeal those people from office .
<Sync time="162.400"/>
look , we think that politicians
<Sync time="164.180"/>
deserve the opportunity to
<Sync time="166.260"/>
uh to fill out their time in office .
<Sync time="168.930"/>
look at someone like president obama :
<Sync time="170.825"/>
in the early term of president obama, in his first term ,
<Sync time="173.650"/>
approval for president obama was fairly low , below fifty percent ,
<Sync time="177.160"/>
individuals didn't think that he was able to accomplish much ,
<Sync time="179.745"/>
and he seemed
<Sync time="180.580"/>
uh kind of trapped by his healthcare-
<Sync time="182.890"/>
by his healthcare policy ,
<Sync time="184.165"/>
and not much more of significant accomplishment . then he went on to do things ,
<Sync time="187.880"/>
like be crucial in the paris climate accord ,
<Sync time="190.005"/>
in passing the iran deal ,
<Sync time="191.550"/>
and his popularity skyrocketed , because individuals were able to see how his policies played out .
<Sync time="196.570"/>
they're able to see the immense the-
<Sync time="198.630"/>
unprecedented
<Sync time="199.760"/>
streak of job growth and job creation ,
<Sync time="202.080"/>
that came after obama's stimulus , something that simply
<Sync time="204.665"/>
was not visible to individuals
<Sync time="206.640"/>
a si- uh
<Sync time="207.185"/>
you know ,
<Sync time="207.840"/>
a number of months , six months , a year out from when that policy was passed .
<Sync time="211.430"/>
and we think that recall eluctio-
<Sync time="212.610"/>
elections
<Sync time="213.430"/>
damage the in-
<Sync time="214.255"/>
the integrity of the political system ,
<Sync time="216.290"/>
as it currently exists . and for those reasons , we should not introduce recall elections .
<Sync time="222.200"/>
