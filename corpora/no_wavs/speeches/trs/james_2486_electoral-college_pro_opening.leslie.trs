we should abolish the u_s electoral college .
<Sync time="3.765"/>
so for those who don't know ,
<Sync time="5.390"/>
the american president is not elected by the american people .
<Sync time="9.160"/>
instead , the american people vote
<Sync time="11.225"/>
for representatives to go from their state to a group called the electoral college ,
<Sync time="15.750"/>
who then select the president amongst themselves .
<Sync time="18.690"/>
we have a few reasons why we think this practice should be abolished and replaced with a nationwide
<Sync time="23.325"/>
popular vote .
<Sync time="24.605"/>
first ,
<Sync time="25.690"/>
we tell you that the electoral college is fundamentally undemocratic .
<Sync time="29.680"/>
why is this so ?
<Sync time="31.175"/>
the way that seats are allocated in the electoral college is that every state gets one seat
<Sync time="35.800"/>
according to n- the number of representatives and senators they have .
<Sync time="39.200"/>
this is a problem because every state gets two senators ,
<Sync time="42.355"/>
and because
<Sync time="43.220"/>
the smaller states are still guaranteed at least one representative .
<Sync time="47.570"/>
what that means is that each electoral college person in california represents hundreds of thousands of people
<Sync time="53.560"/>
whereas in wyoming , they likely only represent
<Sync time="56.085"/>
a couple tens of thousands of people .
<Sync time="58.270"/>
some people's votes count as much as five or six times more than other people's votes , and we think that this is fundamentally
<Sync time="64.460"/>
antithetical to the idea of liberal democracy .
<Sync time="67.720"/>
we think that people in california deserve the same representation by the president as people in wyoming .
<Sync time="73.150"/>
and recognize that because of the way the system is set up ,
<Sync time="76.210"/>
people don't even campaign in many of the most populous states ,
<Sync time="79.445"/>
like new york , texas and california .
<Sync time="82.360"/>
ultimately , they ignore those voters to instead focus on people who are disproportionately powerful
<Sync time="87.295"/>
because of the electoral college , like voters in iowa
<Sync time="90.285"/>
and ohio .
<Sync time="91.370"/>
so those people
<Sync time="92.415"/>
have a huge amount of say and control over the president's policies
<Sync time="96.090"/>
and the future of the country
<Sync time="97.630"/>
relative to the vast majority of people ,
<Sync time="99.765"/>
who live in safe states like california ,
<Sync time="102.145"/>
that will always go to one particular party .
<Sync time="105.100"/>

<Sync time="106.190"/>
our second argument is f- that we think the electoral college causes unnecessary conflict
<Sync time="110.690"/>
and degradation of democracy
<Sync time="112.570"/>
in the united states .
<Sync time="114.680"/>
if you'll recall , in the two thousand election ,
<Sync time="117.210"/>
george bush and al gore sued each other
<Sync time="119.535"/>
and ultimately , the new president was selected by the supreme court
<Sync time="122.950"/>
rather than any elected body .
<Sync time="124.795"/>
the reason why this is so was that the electoral college is vague
<Sync time="128.280"/>
and its proceedings don't make any sense .
<Sync time="130.960"/>
states allocate their electors according to a winner-takes-all principle ,
<Sync time="134.715"/>
which means that a difference of two hundred votes in florida , which is a rounding error in a state of twenty million people ,
<Sync time="140.860"/>
ultimately decided the presidential election .
<Sync time="143.530"/>
at that point , it's up to courts to recount votes if they're challenged by the candidates
<Sync time="148.100"/>
and ultimately , you lead to months-long , very expensive recount processes
<Sync time="152.515"/>
that wouldn't need to take place in the event of a popular vote ,
<Sync time="155.390"/>
because no president has ever won the national popular vote
<Sync time="158.150"/>
by two hundred votes , but that often happens
<Sync time="160.455"/>
in given states .
<Sync time="161.950"/>

<Sync time="162.470"/>
but not only does it create conflict in that sense , it also creates conflict in the sense
<Sync time="167.415"/>
that many people living in larger states are resentful
<Sync time="170.345"/>
and are more willing to back politicians
<Sync time="172.320"/>
in other sectors , such as the senate and house of representatives ,
<Sync time="175.720"/>
who will represent their interests at the expense of the nation , because they don't feel represented
<Sync time="179.955"/>
by the president .
<Sync time="180.990"/>
so we think this undermines cooperation
<Sync time="183.285"/>
and also the perception of fairness in american democracy ,
<Sync time="186.435"/>
and that this is very likely one reason why the u_s
<Sync time="188.900"/>
has chronically low voter turnout .
<Sync time="192.200"/>

<Sync time="192.960"/>
the final reason we should abolish the electoral college ,
<Sync time="195.815"/>
and this seems so obvious that i'm shocked that such intelligent men as james madison let the system go into effect ,
<Sync time="201.570"/>
is that it allows for ties .
<Sync time="203.850"/>
right now , if the electoral college is tied ,
<Sync time="206.190"/>
then the senate , i believe ,
<Sync time="207.920"/>
breaks the vote ,
<Sync time="208.760"/>
not important who , someone in the legislature .
<Sync time="211.070"/>
but why would you have a system for choosing the president
<Sync time="214.230"/>
that allows for ties ?
<Sync time="215.720"/>
you don't allow even numbers of people on
<Sync time="217.805"/>
corporate boards ,
<Sync time="219.190"/>
you don't allo- have an even number of judges on things like american idol .
<Sync time="222.870"/>
it just seems tremendously foolish to allow
<Sync time="225.170"/>
such an ineffective
<Sync time="226.430"/>
metric for choosing the president .
<Sync time="228.585"/>
and the other team may say that ties are unlikely ,
<Sync time="231.360"/>
but they're certainly not impossible , especially given that some states always vote in a particular direction .
<Sync time="236.830"/>
we think that this shortcoming alone should be enough reason to get rid of the electoral college .
<Sync time="241.130"/>
for these reasons , it should be abolished .
<Sync time="243.040"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="243.909"/>
