we should not ban frats becasue
<Sync time="3.620"/>
banning frats won't do any good , it
<Sync time="5.860"/>
unfairly targets frats and the consequences
<Sync time="8.590"/>
will um
<Sync time="9.285"/>
actually be a whole lot worse .
<Sync time="11.170"/>
let's start by talking about why the consequences of banning frats will be worse .
<Sync time="15.060"/>
and i think that the biggest reason for this is because you can ban oficial affiliation with frats , you can ban frats being on school campuses , and you can refuse to endorse them
<Sync time="24.845"/>
but you can't actually ban frats in their totality .
<Sync time="27.990"/>
what this would ultimately create if you tried to ban frats is a
<Sync time="30.570"/>
situation like you see it
<Sync time="32.050"/>
places like brandeis where
<Sync time="33.880"/>
uh frats aren't formally recognized but becau-
<Sync time="36.595"/>
um but uh nevertheless exist in an informal capacity off campus
<Sync time="41.240"/>
because like obviously uh
<Sync time="42.890"/>
you can't stop people from getting houses off campus with their friends and having
<Sync time="46.900"/>
people over
<Sync time="47.730"/>
and you can't stop people from just like associating with other people as individuals off campus that's like
<Sync time="53.270"/>
uh a clear like constitutional issue their freedom of association .
<Sync time="56.885"/>
so there's really nothing that you can actually do about um
<Sync time="59.820"/>
banning fraternities in an off campus informal capacity ,
<Sync time="63.805"/>
so really the comparative is
<Sync time="65.805"/>
would you rather have fraternities be on campus in a more regu- uh
<Sync time="70.065"/>
fashion that is easier to regulate
<Sync time="72.435"/>
or would you rather them be off campus in a more informal capacity .
<Sync time="75.495"/>
and i think it's obvious that it's better to have them on campus
<Sync time="79.100"/>
because when they're off campus ,
<Sync time="81.020"/>
first and foremost
<Sync time="82.120"/>
university health and safety resources aren't going to be able to readily access . you can't call university police,  you have to call regular police if there's any problems there
<Sync time="90.430"/>
which most people are unwilling to do because they're afraid of consequences .
<Sync time="93.860"/>
same with e_m_t's and paramedics , people are probably more willing to reach out to their university for
<Sync time="98.610"/>
resources
<Sync time="99.535"/>
than actual authorities where they may be worried about consequences .
<Sync time="103.340"/>
when they're uh off campus you're not able to get things like bartenders , you're not able to make sure that there's like
<Sync time="108.565"/>
people monitoring the event because they're happening in um like a safer area
<Sync time="113.180"/>
um rather than in like a basement in some random person's house half a mile away from campus .
<Sync time="118.940"/>
um so all of those things make it more likely that the worst things that frats do
<Sync time="122.915"/>
are just going to escalate ,
<Sync time="124.450"/>
whether it's hazing , whether it's sexual assault ,
<Sync time="126.840"/>
whether it's like other problematic behaviors ,
<Sync time="129.440"/>
those things aren't going to go away they're just going to get worse because now they're happening in a less
<Sync time="133.640"/>
regulatable fashion .
<Sync time="134.825"/>
but the next thing that i want to talk about is about how this unfairly targets frats anyway ,
<Sync time="140.230"/>
because obviously all of the problematic things that fraternities do whether it's hazing whether it's uh
<Sync time="145.340"/>
like contributing to rape culture or anything like that anything that you could name that a frat does that's bad
<Sync time="149.840"/>
isn't necessarily unique to the frat .
<Sync time="152.630"/>
obviously sexual assaults and things like that
<Sync time="155.170"/>
don't just happen in fraternities , don't just happen
<Sync time="157.920"/>
at frat parties .
<Sync time="158.750"/>
they're a part of like a widespread culture um
<Sync time="161.800"/>
and
<Sync time="163.015"/>
i don't think that getting rid of frats is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like uh
<Sync time="167.885"/>
the way that like um
<Sync time="169.435"/>
women feel safe on campus probably much more effective would be just like
<Sync time="173.110"/>
trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic rather than just trying to ban organizations that
<Sync time="178.535"/>
%hes
<Sync time="179.040"/>
that like contribute to these kinds of things . you're not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like
<Sync time="184.385"/>
attacking a symptom of it or like um
<Sync time="186.590"/>
a method of it .
<Sync time="187.800"/>
but i think also beyond that obviously there's other uh
<Sync time="190.750"/>
organizations that operate similarly
<Sync time="192.940"/>
there is hazing in like parties and things like that
<Sync time="195.430"/>
um for sports teams ,
<Sync time="197.230"/>
like um other clubs and things like that do that do that too like the brandeis debate teams has throne parties before
<Sync time="202.300"/>
um like
<Sync time="203.250"/>
so obviously like you can't just like fully regulate these kinds of behaviors um it's simply an impossible thing
<Sync time="208.600"/>
to do
<Sync time="209.160"/>
and it would be an unfair thing to do because um ultimately frats
<Sync time="213.390"/>
engage in similar behaviors to a lot of other entities .
<Sync time="216.045"/>
so for all those reasons , don't ban frats .
<Sync time="218.825"/>
