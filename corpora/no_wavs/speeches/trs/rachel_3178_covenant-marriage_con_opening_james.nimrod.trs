when it comes to covenant marriages ,
<Sync time="2.560"/>
it's unclear why we need the government to recognize it ,
<Sync time="5.530"/>
given that individuals
<Sync time="7.050"/>
and communities
<Sync time="8.080"/>
can still recognize it personally .
<Sync time="10.890"/>
drew never points out why there are specific benefits
<Sync time="13.925"/>
to the government recognizing these marriages as well ,
<Sync time="16.960"/>
except to say that it is more easily regulatable , and i'll tell you why he's wrong about that
<Sync time="21.130"/>
later .
<Sync time="21.770"/>
two main areas of clash , the first on why these kinds of marriages
<Sync time="25.880"/>
trap people , and often especially women ,
<Sync time="28.450"/>
in marriages that
<Sync time="29.690"/>
might not be happy in the long term .
<Sync time="32.330"/>
recognize first , that
<Sync time="34.005"/>
even though people might get extensive counseling before entering a marriage ,
<Sync time="38.290"/>
they might think that they know these pers- people so well ,
<Sync time="41.210"/>
it is often not the case that you can predict everything that will occur in your future .
<Sync time="45.920"/>
no one gets married
<Sync time="47.200"/>
thinking that it will end in divorce .
<Sync time="49.270"/>
the reason , that we do not put up extra barriers to divorce ,
<Sync time="52.250"/>
is because we recognize that
<Sync time="54.055"/>
these kinds of things- that people change ,
<Sync time="56.130"/>
and that we-
<Sync time="57.050"/>
and that we have to let them escape
<Sync time="58.960"/>
and change themselves ,
<Sync time="60.115"/>
as their relationships change as well .
<Sync time="63.010"/>
drew is so worried about freedom ,
<Sync time="64.920"/>
but he decreases it by making these assumptions .
<Sync time="68.010"/>
he says that
<Sync time="69.245"/>
people who enter are going to be so consenting ,
<Sync time="71.980"/>
but we don't think this is true .
<Sync time="73.680"/>
we think these individuals usually grow up in these communities ,
<Sync time="76.570"/>
and are pressured to participate ,
<Sync time="78.280"/>
and more than this are often not provided with another option .
<Sync time="82.070"/>
it is only
<Sync time="82.880"/>
after you are an adult ,
<Sync time="84.250"/>
that you can actually be able to explore the rest of the world around you ,
<Sync time="87.870"/>
and recognize what your real decisions
<Sync time="89.830"/>
meant , or what you have signed yourself up for .
<Sync time="92.170"/>
so ,
<Sync time="92.800"/>
a lot of the time these people get married quite young ,
<Sync time="95.430"/>
around eighteen to twenty ,
<Sync time="97.020"/>
and it's not until later in their lives , that they recognize what they gave up ,
<Sync time="100.530"/>
or have more access to the outside world .
<Sync time="103.770"/>
so , we think that when you do things , like
<Sync time="106.230"/>
recognize covenant marriage by the state ,
<Sync time="108.395"/>
you are not only allowing these people to be pressured by their communities to maintain an unhappy marriage ,
<Sync time="113.860"/>
but also allowing the state to put pressure on them as well ,
<Sync time="117.280"/>
and preventing the state from interfering in the situations ,
<Sync time="120.410"/>
because it recognizes this covenant as
<Sync time="122.675"/>
legal .
<Sync time="123.450"/>
we think women are especially susceptible to this ,
<Sync time="126.240"/>
insofar as a lot of the time these communities
<Sync time="128.520"/>
place less value on female happiness ,
<Sync time="131.005"/>
and force them into patriarchal roles 
<Sync time="133.110"/>
in the house ,
<Sync time="134.270"/>
and they're like often given the least choice over their futures .
<Sync time="138.670"/>
so , we think that , at least on our side of the house ,
<Sync time="141.620"/>
if someone decides that they're done ,
<Sync time="143.320"/>
they can get state backing to escape the situation .
<Sync time="146.205"/>
on their side ,
<Sync time="147.560"/>
you make it so that the government can no longer interfere in these marriages ,
<Sync time="151.450"/>
when someone says i am done ,
<Sync time="153.200"/>
because it {recognize/recognizes} the covenant as legal ,
<Sync time="155.550"/>
and forces them to continue through these difficulties .
<Sync time="157.955"/>
our second of clash has to do with why it gives even more power and control to religious communities .
<Sync time="164.280"/>
we think that the church and the state
<Sync time="165.660"/>
ought be kept as separate as possible ,
<Sync time="167.725"/>
because the state obligation ought to be to people ,
<Sync time="170.305"/>
not to religious bodies .
<Sync time="172.395"/>
and when you recognize covenant marriage ,
<Sync time="174.650"/>
you {seed/secede} more control
<Sync time="176.475"/>
over people's lives
<Sync time="177.860"/>
to religions .
<Sync time="179.115"/>
we think this is problematic , because religion is often run by patriarchal , outdated , and sexist norms .
<Sync time="185.110"/>
so ,
<Sync time="185.645"/>
a lot of the time , in these kinds of religious covenants ,
<Sync time="188.165"/>
not only are women being given away very young ,
<Sync time="190.880"/>
not only are they like being told that things , oftentimes , that like birth control is immoral ,
<Sync time="195.870"/>
they're not really given control over their own bodies ,
<Sync time="198.390"/>
their pleasure is vilified ,
<Sync time="200.020"/>
but now the state recognizes these acts as legal ,
<Sync time="202.865"/>
and says : okay ,
<Sync time="204.420"/>
like were all right with this ,
<Sync time="205.920"/>
let religion take that control .
<Sync time="208.510"/>
when drew says that it's easier to regulate ,
<Sync time="210.630"/>
he's just wrong ,
<Sync time="212.040"/>
because the only time , that this is regulatable at all ,
<Sync time="215.340"/>
is when it's not legally recognized ,
<Sync time="217.350"/>
because that recognition
<Sync time="218.700"/>
binds the spee-
<Sync time="219.560"/>
state to specific action .
<Sync time="221.485"/>
so in the status quo ,
<Sync time="223.440"/>
if there is a covenant marriage ,
<Sync time="225.255"/>
and
<Sync time="225.900"/>
someone says i'm done , and the religious community says
<Sync time="228.995"/>
no you're not , you agreed to this ,
<Sync time="231.020"/>
then the state is obligated to say
<Sync time="233.030"/>
that the religious community is wrong ,
<Sync time="234.820"/>
and side with the individual .
<Sync time="236.470"/>
but on their side of the house ,
<Sync time="237.920"/>
what occurs
<Sync time="238.795"/>
is that because the state has recognized this ,
<Sync time="241.115"/>
they must allow the church to go on with its proceedings .
<Sync time="244.500"/>
drew pretends these proceedings are no big deal ,
<Sync time="246.900"/>
but recognize that you can draw out counselling
<Sync time="249.090"/>
infinitely .
<Sync time="249.985"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="252.455"/>
