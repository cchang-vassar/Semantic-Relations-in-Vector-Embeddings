we should ban cosmetic surgery because of the impact that it has on people's emotional health
<Sync time="5.980"/>
and the financial costs that it imposes on people as well .
<Sync time="9.060"/>
so in order to show why we think that these uh harms are likely to be realized ,
<Sync time="14.230"/>
we're going to first talk to you about how
<Sync time="16.210"/>
legalized cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="18.030"/>
leads to an
<Sync time="18.665"/>
culture in which cosmetic surgery is glorified ,
<Sync time="21.790"/>
and it creates false uh {ideal--s/ideals} of beauty ,
<Sync time="25.115"/>
and that ultimately this is what leads to those harms .
<Sync time="27.760"/>
so how do we so how does p-
<Sync time="29.450"/>
cosmetic surgery do this .
<Sync time="31.150"/>
so we would say that cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="33.340"/>
oftentimes leads to people
<Sync time="35.330"/>
uh n- n- changing their body in ways that they otherwise shouldn't .
<Sync time="37.920"/>
whether it's models that are s- uh
<Sync time="39.810"/>
like
<Sync time="40.160"/>
are plastered around on advertisements to look in a certain way ,
<Sync time="43.440"/>
or advertisements that say that you can look better if you get something like a botox or a breast or a breast au- augmentation surgery .
<Sync time="50.680"/>
we believe that these kinds of uh procedures
<Sync time="53.525"/>
are what uh leads to an entire culture where ultimately this is the expectation for how you should look .
<Sync time="58.960"/>
and we believe it is when the
<Sync time="60.515"/>
a cul- when a culture creates this kind of an expectation for beauty ,
<Sync time="64.420"/>
it means that cosmetic surgery oftentimes is something that people feel pressured into getting ,
<Sync time="69.000"/>
something that they feel that they must get in order to feel wanted ,
<Sync time="72.500"/>
attracted or lovable .
<Sync time="73.915"/>
so
<Sync time="74.510"/>
why do we think that this is harmful for people's emotional health .
<Sync time="77.685"/>
because first and foremost quite simply ,
<Sync time="79.915"/>
this means that most people are not going to be able to meet a societal ideal of beauty
<Sync time="84.480"/>
without engaging in these cosmetic surgery .
<Sync time="86.710"/>
this means that in order for people to feel comfortable in their own skin ,
<Sync time="90.590"/>
they have to go and pay for a procedure .
<Sync time="92.520"/>
that's obviously something that is not good and something that we shouldn't
<Sync time="95.875"/>
uh encourage within a society .
<Sync time="97.730"/>
but additionally we think
<Sync time="99.000"/>
that since oftentimes a whole lot of people aren't going to be able to access cosmetic surgery ,
<Sync time="103.850"/>
whether it's for economic reasons ,
<Sync time="105.810"/>
or parental consent reasons , or simply not knowing how to do it , or being afraid of the procedure altogether ,
<Sync time="111.550"/>
this means that a whole lot of people are going to have a low sense of self esteem and a lower sense of self worth ,
<Sync time="116.910"/>
because they're not going to
<Sync time="117.995"/>
feel like they look the same as people in advertisements ,
<Sync time="120.750"/>
or look like the prettiest people at school ,
<Sync time="122.800"/>
or the most attractive people
<Sync time="124.310"/>
who are going to look these kinds of ways .
<Sync time="126.550"/>
so why do we think that this is incredibly problematic .
<Sync time="129.475"/>
given that there is honestly uh a higher prevalence then
<Sync time="132.820"/>
um
<Sync time="133.260"/>
in a lot of cases for things like depression or other forms of mental illness ,
<Sync time="137.030"/>
we would say that it's incredibly important to make sure that we encourage people to have a healthier outlook on their body and a higher sense of self worth .
<Sync time="144.590"/>
but this is something that is directly uh discouraged
<Sync time="147.595"/>
by a world in which uh cosmetic surgery is legalized .
<Sync time="150.760"/>
and the next thing that i want to talk about under this , finally is about the financial cost that this is often
<Sync time="156.050"/>
going to impose on people .
<Sync time="157.260"/>
what do we mean by this ?
<Sync time="158.640"/>
so i already talked about how cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="161.510"/>
leads to a culture in which you're likely going to see people want to pursue this for in order to look better .
<Sync time="167.290"/>
this is problematic because we think that in a lot of ways
<Sync time="170.110"/>
these procedures can be quite expensive , they can run up
<Sync time="172.810"/>
margined cost margins of thousands of dollars .
<Sync time="175.390"/>
so when people are uh coerced into spending thousands of dollars on frivolous nonsense ,
<Sync time="180.560"/>
they obviously have less money for other things as well ,
<Sync time="183.260"/>
things that be hu-
<Sync time="183.985"/>
could be quite important for them like food , support ,
<Sync time="186.435"/>
or other things that can make them happy overall , like vacation time .
<Sync time="189.400"/>
but we also think that this is quite bad in general , because what this is essentially amounting to is society coercing people in a way
<Sync time="195.715"/>
so they would'nt spend this money otherwise .
<Sync time="197.740"/>
something i think is a real problem .
<Sync time="199.400"/>
so
<Sync time="199.985"/>
the final thing that i want to talk about is about how this uniquely harms poor people .
<Sync time="203.980"/>
because we think that oftentimes there's a lot of negative stereotypes that fall around poor people ,
<Sync time="208.730"/>
like in america for example
<Sync time="210.460"/>
poor people are often seen if there uh in a racialized sense , poor people who are minorities are often seen as more hyper sexualized or more unattractive in certain ways ,
<Sync time="219.860"/>
while poor white people are often made fun of for things like missing teeth or likes like that .
<Sync time="224.405"/>
we would say that oftentimes this is in many ways contributing to a buyer culture
<Sync time="228.340"/>
in which cosmetic surgery exists ,
<Sync time="230.210"/>
and the expectations that you're going to look a certain way .
<Sync time="233.140"/>
and we think that in a lot of ways this creates a distain for certain groups of people in society ,
<Sync time="237.610"/>
a distain which can also ultimately drive policies that we see
<Sync time="240.995"/>
of far greater importance .
<Sync time="242.310"/>
so it is for all of those reasons we think that you should ban cosmetic surgery .
<Sync time="247.025"/>

<Sync time="249.120"/>

<Sync time="251.905"/>

<Sync time="253.820"/>
