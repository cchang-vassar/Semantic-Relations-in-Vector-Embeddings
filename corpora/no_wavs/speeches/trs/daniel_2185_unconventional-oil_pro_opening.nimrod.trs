we should further exploit unconventional oil for two big reasons :
<Sync time="5.115"/>
first , because the further exploitation of unconventional oil will lead to a drop in oil prices , which will make
<Sync time="11.330"/>
just about everything in our lives cheaper ,
<Sync time="13.925"/>
and secondarily , because it'll give us
<Sync time="16.620"/>
independence from foreign oil , which is
<Sync time="19.290"/>
certainly beneficial from a like geopolitical perspective ,
<Sync time="22.965"/>
uh from a strategic perspective
<Sync time="24.510"/>
in international relations .
<Sync time="26.400"/>
so , let's start by talking about why this is going to lead to a drop in the prices of oil , and why that's so important .
<Sync time="32.220"/>
so ,
<Sync time="32.765"/>
it's going to lead to a drop in the prices of oil because you're just going to have more of a supply of it .
<Sync time="37.150"/>
there's a lot of uh untapped things , like oil sands , or like shale oil , things like that ,
<Sync time="43.150"/>
that are being extracted , and there's
<Sync time="45.760"/>
a lot of new opportunities for more advanced ways to extract oil ,
<Sync time="49.420"/>
which is leading to a large surplus of oil ,
<Sync time="51.610"/>
which is what's leading to the price drops in oil .
<Sync time="55.000"/>
this is incredibly important , because
<Sync time="56.790"/>
cheaper oil prices doesn't merely means that , your cars are going to be able to
<Sync time="61.075"/>
go to places for less money ,
<Sync time="63.070"/>
although that is very important , sense most americans commute to work and
<Sync time="67.125"/>
get a lot of their day-to-day provisions
<Sync time="69.400"/>
through their car ,
<Sync time="70.540"/>
so that is very important .
<Sync time="71.990"/>
this also affects things like public transportation , and a lot of other sources of transportation .
<Sync time="77.010"/>
it also affects things like basic heating and cooking costs , as a lot of places , especially in the northeast ,
<Sync time="82.510"/>
use uh oil for their heating .
<Sync time="85.020"/>
it also affects just about anything that uses plastic , so
<Sync time="88.980"/>
plastics are used in almost everything in day to day lives .
<Sync time="92.370"/>
plastics use oil , so when the price of oil goes down , the price of anything that uses plastic also goes
<Sync time="97.610"/>
down .
<Sync time="98.225"/>
at the end of the day , these costs pile up a lot ,
<Sync time="101.090"/>
and
<Sync time="101.650"/>
a decrease in the price of oil means that , it's just much easier
<Sync time="105.040"/>
for the average person to live the day- their day to day lives , because the cost of living just goes down ,
<Sync time="110.240"/>
they're able to do things on a lighter budget, which is just
<Sync time="112.860"/>
very helpful for people
<Sync time="114.350"/>
uh in an economy , it's a great way to get an economy
<Sync time="116.970"/>
going . but , the second thing that i want to talk about
<Sync time="119.380"/>
is about
<Sync time="120.720"/>
foreign oil and about how this is going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil .
<Sync time="124.625"/>
so ,
<Sync time="126.150"/>
first like principally , if
<Sync time="128.480"/>
um all of the reasons that i talked about in my last point , about how
<Sync time="132.450"/>
important oil price stability , and
<Sync time="134.820"/>
uh especially if they can be lower ,
<Sync time="136.960"/>
uh how important those are to an economy , because how much they affect the day to day life .
<Sync time="141.150"/>
those are very very important things that , you don't want to have
<Sync time="144.470"/>
based on the whims of an oil cartel like opec .
<Sync time="146.995"/>
because , if
<Sync time="148.330"/>
they decide that they want to increase oil prices , or de- uh do something to increase the prices of oil ,
<Sync time="154.490"/>
what this means is
<Sync time="155.245"/>
that , they essentially have control over your economy , because
<Sync time="158.965"/>
they're able to make things more expensive for every person
<Sync time="162.055"/>
that is in your economy .
<Sync time="163.960"/>
that's an incredible degree of control that another government is going to have over you ,
<Sync time="167.900"/>
which means that they can use that leverage against you , to try to like uh
<Sync time="171.370"/>
get more favorable like uh business proposals in some cases uh ,
<Sync time="175.775"/>
looking the other way on , possibly , human rights abuses that may be happening ,
<Sync time="179.990"/>
uh support for more despotic regimes ,
<Sync time="182.960"/>
there's all kinds of ways , in which
<Sync time="184.530"/>
foreign governments can use this as leverage , in order to get what they want out of
<Sync time="188.505"/>
uh governments like the united states .
<Sync time="190.880"/>
and ,
<Sync time="191.670"/>
that's incredibly problematic , because it can undermine your values , it can undermine your economic interests ,
<Sync time="197.190"/>
and it undermines the uh
<Sync time="198.985"/>
economic livelihoods of the citizens in your country .
<Sync time="201.850"/>
so , that's like very very bad 
<Sync time="203.970"/>
also .
<Sync time="204.550"/>
there's also the more tenuous idea , about how uh
<Sync time="208.130"/>
you don't want this to be like , maybe linked
<Sync time="210.570"/>
to terrorist organizations or things like that
<Sync time="212.190"/>
either ,
<Sync time="212.900"/>
which can also be the result of li- like state funded
<Sync time="215.295"/>
terrorism ,
<Sync time="216.210"/>
which can also sometimes happen when you are purchasing um
<Sync time="219.670"/>
from certain countries um
<Sync time="221.235"/>
in the middle east . and this is also sometimes a problem , like a lot of like um
<Sync time="224.650"/>
members of the saudi arabian government
<Sync time="226.430"/>
have been linked to terrorist act-
<Sync time="228.525"/>
uh like have been linked to
<Sync time="229.510"/>
funding terrorism and things like this .
<Sync time="231.435"/>
uh these are also things that um ,
<Sync time="233.550"/>
you're not going that many problems
<Sync time="235.260"/>
if you're trying to use unconventional oil ,
<Sync time="237.840"/>
uh things like oil shales , like in canada or north dakota , or things like that .
<Sync time="242.290"/>
so , for all of those reasons , very very proud to propose .
<Sync time="247.109"/>
