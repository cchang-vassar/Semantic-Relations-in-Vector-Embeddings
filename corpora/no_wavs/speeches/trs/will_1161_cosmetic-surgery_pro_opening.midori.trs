i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban cosmetic surgery .
<Sync time="5.980"/>
so first the model .
<Sync time="8.060"/>
um we wouldn't ban things that are medically necessary or like reconstructive surgery .
<Sync time="13.290"/>
so for example , if you were to get into a car crash ,
<Sync time="16.690"/>
we're not and half of your faces is sheared off ,
<Sync time="19.960"/>
we're not going to say that you can't get reconstructive surgery to fix that issue .
<Sync time="25.000"/>
likewise , if you need skin grafts to deal with some sort of life threatening injury ,
<Sync time="30.200"/>
again ,
<Sync time="30.790"/>
we are not going to say that you are not allowed to get that .
<Sync time="33.665"/>
when we say
<Sync time="35.150"/>
cosmetic surgery 
<Sync time="36.800"/>
we mean
<Sync time="37.370"/>
strictly for non medical purposes .
<Sync time="40.400"/>
that is someone is like
<Sync time="42.660"/>
i think my nose is too big
<Sync time="44.860"/>
i want it to be smaller . things like that .
<Sync time="47.365"/>

<Sync time="47.890"/>
the implementation method for the government
<Sync time="50.260"/>
is maybe not totally clear here , but i think generally we're willing to just let the government have a bit of a sniff test on what does and does not constitute cosmetic .
<Sync time="58.120"/>
so two independent points under this then :
<Sync time="61.095"/>
first ,
<Sync time="62.070"/>
is that societal beauty standards are generally enforced through cosmetic surgery ,
<Sync time="66.750"/>
and we deem these standards to be problematic .
<Sync time="69.080"/>
and the second
<Sync time="70.060"/>
is that the expenditures that are made in the cosmetic surgery industry are wasteful spending
<Sync time="75.505"/>
and damage the economy as a result of it . 
<Sync time="77.695"/>

<Sync time="78.280"/>
on the first point ,
<Sync time="79.315"/>
that societal beauty standards are a problem .
<Sync time="82.035"/>
so i think
<Sync time="82.750"/>
generally speaking it is an uncontroversial point to say that it is bad
<Sync time="86.770"/>
when there is like this socially defined
<Sync time="89.405"/>
idea of what does and does not constitute beauty .
<Sync time="92.420"/>
there's a good episode of the twilight zone that talks about this . how basically
<Sync time="96.135"/>
all of these things are inherently arbitrary .
<Sync time="99.105"/>
that our notion of what
<Sync time="101.165"/>
constitutes being attractive ,
<Sync time="103.515"/>
is in and of itself
<Sync time="105.170"/>
ridiculous and not actually based on any sort of objectivity .
<Sync time="108.660"/>
i think a good example of this is actually just the fact that
<Sync time="111.360"/>
these standards were totally different a couple of decades ago .
<Sync time="114.940"/>
the problem then is that
<Sync time="116.360"/>
cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="117.570"/>
enforces these things .
<Sync time="119.205"/>
so
<Sync time="120.070"/>
on the arbitrariness
<Sync time="121.320"/>
that alone is a reason why this is bad .
<Sync time="123.095"/>
but additionally we would say that these are
<Sync time="125.585"/>
things that are enforced through sexist structures ,
<Sync time="128.060"/>
that generally speaking it is men decide what they find to be attractive
<Sync time="131.605"/>
and then women
<Sync time="132.350"/>
modeling themselves in that image .
<Sync time="134.790"/>
so we think that the existence of cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="137.020"/>
is a multi-billion dollar industry
<Sync time="139.360"/>
designed to enforce patriarchal structures .
<Sync time="142.010"/>
that if you were to ban it ,
<Sync time="143.680"/>
it would be tougher to enforce the societal beauty standards
<Sync time="146.840"/>
and it would be more difficult for
<Sync time="149.295"/>
men to have this world where they simply
<Sync time="151.725"/>
model women to their liking . 
<Sync time="153.985"/>
on the second point ,
<Sync time="155.520"/>
that the industry itself
<Sync time="157.170"/>
represents large amounts of wasted money .
<Sync time="159.365"/>
i think it's
<Sync time="160.225"/>
pretty fair to say that this is a useless expenditure .
<Sync time="163.065"/>
that generally speaking
<Sync time="164.785"/>
the things that we get out of spending this money
<Sync time="167.210"/>
are very like short term gains that
<Sync time="170.440"/>
even the best surgeons in the world can generally
<Sync time="173.045"/>
not do much that would uh
<Sync time="175.750"/>
{compat/combat} like the
<Sync time="177.045"/>
ravages of age and
<Sync time="178.605"/>
in the long term these things probably aren't going to hold too much water .
<Sync time="182.330"/>
so the alternatives
<Sync time="184.370"/>
though , to this sort of like luxury spending ,
<Sync time="186.865"/>
are things that generate growth
<Sync time="188.700"/>
to a much larger extent than this does , right ?
<Sync time="191.140"/>
like if i decide i want like a nose job and i'm gonna spend a couple like a million dollars on that or whatever ,
<Sync time="197.260"/>
all that money just goes into the pocket of like
<Sync time="199.095"/>
this one doctor .
<Sync time="200.905"/>
if i decide i want to spend a billion dollars on some
<Sync time="204.555"/>
other absurd thing ,
<Sync time="206.235"/>
like a handbag or whatever ,
<Sync time="208.070"/>
or like a really nice handbag i guess ,
<Sync time="210.185"/>
at least that money is in some capacity going to like workers that were in the factory where this thing was made .
<Sync time="216.020"/>
like
<Sync time="216.510"/>
multiple people involved in this industry .
<Sync time="218.910"/>
there is some amount of wealth being spread around through that
<Sync time="222.020"/>
industry
<Sync time="222.730"/>
that doesn't happen with plastic surgery .
<Sync time="225.190"/>
because you're spending so much money on a thing that only benefits people who are already very wealthy .
<Sync time="230.690"/>
we prefer then the world where you ban this
<Sync time="233.305"/>
and then that luxury spending goes to things that at least have some sort of multiplier effect . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="239.755"/>
