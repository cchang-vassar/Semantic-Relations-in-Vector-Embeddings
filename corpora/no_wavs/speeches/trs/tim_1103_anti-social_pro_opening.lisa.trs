we should abolish antisocial behavior orders .
<Sync time="4.090"/>
antisocial behavior orders are orders that courts
<Sync time="6.955"/>
are able to
<Sync time="7.750"/>
pass upon individuals in torts
<Sync time="9.995"/>
in which individuals that express what are known as antisocial behaviors , are broadly
<Sync time="14.810"/>
behaviors that go outside of social norms .
<Sync time="17.620"/>
that these individuals can be
<Sync time="19.275"/>
both publicly shamed
<Sync time="20.460"/>
and it ensures that these individuals in certain cases can be prohibited
<Sync time="24.265"/>
from behaving in these ways . this can be anything from breaking local ordinances
<Sync time="28.600"/>
about sound ,
<Sync time="29.700"/>
to how you behave in a public group
<Sync time="31.575"/>
and using vulgar language things like this . things that go outside
<Sync time="35.110"/>
norms of li-
<Sync time="36.560"/>
of society .
<Sync time="37.830"/>
so we think there are two reasons
<Sync time="39.875"/>
why we should abolish
<Sync time="41.225"/>
a_s_b_os .
<Sync time="42.230"/>
the first
<Sync time="43.080"/>
is that laws should exist to protect freedom and we think that this goes directly
<Sync time="47.260"/>
against that claim .
<Sync time="49.030"/>
firstly , we think that society is structured in such a way where individuals are not meaningfully able
<Sync time="54.075"/>
to opt into the society and the legal system they're born
<Sync time="56.930"/>
into .
<Sync time="57.755"/>
individuals are often born in the country where they'll spend their entire lives
<Sync time="61.740"/>
and never have a choice over where they were born .
<Sync time="63.920"/>
they're
<Sync time="64.320"/>
bred within that society to live within that society's laws
<Sync time="67.865"/>
and the individual has very little control
<Sync time="70.255"/>
over the laws in which they're governed by .
<Sync time="72.240"/>
so even if this in- the vast majority of individuals
<Sync time="75.230"/>
don't get to have a stand in how they make use laws
<Sync time="77.940"/>
outside of you know moderately through voting .
<Sync time="80.620"/>
they don't have a stance over how these laws are enforced ,
<Sync time="83.060"/>
and they don't a stance over who is making
<Sync time="84.920"/>
these laws . so in this way
<Sync time="86.230"/>
we think that law
<Sync time="87.700"/>
uh s-
<Sync time="88.600"/>
law by the state
<Sync time="89.860"/>
is
<Sync time="90.465"/>
should only exist in order to protect freedom ,
<Sync time="93.110"/>
because as individuals exist within the state
<Sync time="95.210"/>
it is already
<Sync time="95.900"/>
an immense burden upon their personal freedom .
<Sync time="98.490"/>
it already prohibits them without their consent from expressing that freedom
<Sync time="102.020"/>
and therefore in order to
<Sync time="103.470"/>
make sure that that state is just and those laws are just ,
<Sync time="106.405"/>
those laws should only refrec-
<Sync time="108.230"/>
reflect
<Sync time="109.075"/>
uh necessary restraints that ensure that
<Sync time="111.955"/>
freedom is maximized
<Sync time="113.465"/>
for the whole . so we think that these things simply
<Sync time="116.200"/>
do not fall
<Sync time="117.440"/>
under that . we think that individuals
<Sync time="119.715"/>
who express antisocial behaviors who are not doing things
<Sync time="122.810"/>
broadly
<Sync time="123.480"/>
that are going to prohibit other individuals from pursuing their freedom ,
<Sync time="126.840"/>
they may be things that irk other individuals , they may be things that are bothersome to certain people .
<Sync time="131.555"/>
but we think that teaching social behavior and
<Sync time="134.010"/>
social norms
<Sync time="135.100"/>
is not the job of laws . it's the job of society .
<Sync time="137.750"/>
it's the job of the community in which people are raised .
<Sync time="140.305"/>
and even if someone is doing something that may be perceived as a nuisance
<Sync time="143.850"/>
one , this doesn't this doesn't mean that that is necessarily warranting some sort of pun-
<Sync time="148.460"/>
punishment or public shaming ,
<Sync time="150.115"/>
and two ,
<Sync time="150.995"/>
it means that the society has failed
<Sync time="152.965"/>
in other steps . it means that that society has failed in properly teaching these individuals
<Sync time="157.690"/>
these social norms .
<Sync time="159.710"/>
so the second problem
<Sync time="161.065"/>
that we have with antisocial behaviors is even if you don't think that the law itself
<Sync time="164.950"/>
is necessarily bad , that it's banning things that are necessarily
<Sync time="167.755"/>
bad . we think the way the law exists now
<Sync time="170.075"/>
is not acceptable .
<Sync time="171.590"/>
so the way that the law exists now
<Sync time="173.920"/>
has very little clarity which we think is necessary
<Sync time="176.545"/>
in order for people to have a just law .
<Sync time="179.190"/>
what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="180.590"/>
antisocial behaviors are understood very broadly so these don't have certain
<Sync time="184.895"/>
particular behaviors with tied
<Sync time="186.790"/>
punishments to them ,
<Sync time="187.710"/>
which means that people can't be fully knowledgeable
<Sync time="190.265"/>
that they're breaking the law when they do it .
<Sync time="192.345"/>
you can't know that you're violating an anti social behavior order
<Sync time="195.855"/>
because the laws that determine what these things are
<Sync time="198.445"/>
are largely discretionary and up to judgments
<Sync time="201.315"/>
of courts
<Sync time="202.350"/>
and groups like this because this is the case we don't think that this law can be fair .
<Sync time="206.600"/>
if one does not have
<Sync time="208.090"/>
men's rare or the understanding that when they're committing an act it is one that is
<Sync time="212.300"/>
with ill intent and against the law ,
<Sync time="214.340"/>
we don't think that it's fair that those people can be punished . if you never knew
<Sync time="217.905"/>
that such an action
<Sync time="219.270"/>
could
<Sync time="219.625"/>
plausibly result in the punishment that you are facing ,
<Sync time="222.445"/>
we don't think it's fair of society
<Sync time="224.320"/>
to push that punishment .
<Sync time="225.860"/>
so even if you were to have these type of antisocial behavior orders we think it would be preferable
<Sync time="230.380"/>
to have a system of laws that reflect very specific behaviors
<Sync time="234.150"/>
and very specific prohibitions .
<Sync time="236.270"/>
so either way
<Sync time="237.745"/>
even if you believe that these
<Sync time="239.250"/>
anti social behavior orders are good in theory that it restricts actions
<Sync time="243.340"/>
in a positive way
<Sync time="244.540"/>
they need to be done in an entirely different manner
<Sync time="246.860"/>
but further ,
<Sync time="247.760"/>
we don't think that these justifications
<Sync time="249.860"/>
are true . we don't think these pre-
<Sync time="251.520"/>
prohibitions are fair
<Sync time="252.860"/>
and for this reason
<Sync time="254.060"/>
we should abolish antisocial behavior orders .
<Sync time="257.455"/>
