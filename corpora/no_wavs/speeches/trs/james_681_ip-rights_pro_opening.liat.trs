we should abolish intellectual property rights .
<Sync time="3.460"/>
so , by intellectual property rights , or
<Sync time="5.855"/>
i_p rights if you prefer ,
<Sync time="7.770"/>
we mean things that are the creations of the mind .
<Sync time="10.720"/>
we're talking about
<Sync time="11.480"/>
patents ,
<Sync time="12.370"/>
copyrights and artistic creations ,
<Sync time="15.230"/>
among many other things
<Sync time="16.510"/>
of similar nature .
<Sync time="18.530"/>
three arguments for why we should abolish i_p rights .
<Sync time="21.385"/>
the first is about spurring more innovation .
<Sync time="24.930"/>
so recognize that
<Sync time="26.180"/>
copyrights and patents in particular
<Sync time="28.360"/>
serve to limit the ability to innovate .
<Sync time="30.890"/>
if one person comes up with a really good idea , 
<Sync time="33.630"/>
nobody else is free to build upon that idea
<Sync time="36.300"/>
for as long as it's held under copyright .
<Sync time="39.210"/>
we see that , for instance , think about
<Sync time="40.960"/>
computing technology . you have
<Sync time="43.375"/>
new chipsets that are created by a company like intel ,
<Sync time="47.075"/>
and then for the next twenty five years
<Sync time="49.740"/>
no one but intel is allowed to innovate
<Sync time="52.510"/>
based off of that
<Sync time="53.450"/>
chipset 
<Sync time="54.195"/>
without intel's permission , which means that either
<Sync time="57.030"/>
intel can charge other companies
<Sync time="59.020"/>
a bunch of money to license the property ,
<Sync time="61.245"/>
at which point they have a huge competitive advantage
<Sync time="64.055"/>
and also prices are higher for consumers and this slows innovation ,
<Sync time="68.165"/>
or we rely on one company to innovate in-house , which means that you have
<Sync time="72.465"/>
fewer great minds thinking about an issue , and ultimately this slows down
<Sync time="76.690"/>
development and innovation in general .
<Sync time="79.860"/>
what this means is that
<Sync time="80.750"/>
you don't get
<Sync time="81.525"/>
new computer technology that can save lives 
<Sync time="84.035"/>
in the medical sphere , you don't get new medications as quickly , because we have to wait for things to go generic before we can innovate based on them .
<Sync time="91.190"/>
ultimately we think that
<Sync time="92.380"/>
many lives would be saved and quality of life would be higher
<Sync time="95.735"/>
if we abolished i_p rights .
<Sync time="98.395"/>
our second argument is about why we think that i- this would help your country compete , because recognize
<Sync time="103.520"/>
if we're talking about abolishing i_p rights , we must mean that we're doing this
<Sync time="106.790"/>
at a national level . so ,
<Sync time="108.435"/>
a given country , canada , say ,
<Sync time="110.325"/>
should abolish i_p rights .
<Sync time="112.510"/>
right now countries with very strong intellectual property protections are hamstrung
<Sync time="117.100"/>
by those same protections .
<Sync time="119.550"/>
other countries in the developing world especially
<Sync time="122.095"/>
are ignoring i_p protections .
<Sync time="124.570"/>
in china
<Sync time="125.490"/>
they aren't respecting
<Sync time="126.600"/>
u_s copyrights on things like software and drugs ,
<Sync time="129.735"/>
they are stealing intellectual property ,
<Sync time="132.120"/>
and because of that they're able to develop a lot of
<Sync time="134.700"/>
new goods very cheaply ,
<Sync time="136.300"/>
they're able to provide quality services to their people
<Sync time="139.140"/>
at a lower cost .
<Sync time="141.010"/>
your country is being outcompeted
<Sync time="143.140"/>
if you don't do the same thing .
<Sync time="145.300"/>
because
<Sync time="145.895"/>
at the end of the day there's a sort of prisoner's dilemma .
<Sync time="148.750"/>
if everyone respected property rights , then it would be
<Sync time="151.455"/>
kind of reasonable to continue to respect them .
<Sync time="154.640"/>
but at the point where you know that other countries like india , like china , are cheating the system ,
<Sync time="159.185"/>
you are just harming your business's ability to compete
<Sync time="162.820"/>
by choosing to respect those i_p rights .
<Sync time="165.080"/>
you are denying your people access to cheap drugs and cheap 
<Sync time="168.370"/>
equ- equipment to do their jobs .
<Sync time="170.620"/>
so we think that your country would be more competitive , and therefore as a government
<Sync time="174.230"/>
you have a clear incentive
<Sync time="176.045"/>
to abolish i_p rights , to allow your country to thrive .
<Sync time="180.480"/>
our third argument and final point is about why we think this would be culturally beneficial .
<Sync time="186.020"/>
realize that when one company owns
<Sync time="188.760"/>
culturally significant art or intellectual property ,
<Sync time="192.470"/>
then that makes it more difficult for other artists and groups to engage with that property .
<Sync time="197.650"/>
we think that , for instance ,
<Sync time="199.510"/>
uh many characters that are very significant in western culture today , like mickey mouse ,
<Sync time="204.660"/>
being held under copyright ,
<Sync time="206.330"/>
limits the ability of small artists or
<Sync time="209.520"/>
uh people from different cultural backgrounds to access
<Sync time="212.780"/>
this cultural heritage .
<Sync time="214.400"/>
we think it would be preferable if art was treated as a common property
<Sync time="217.750"/>
which everyone could engage with
<Sync time="219.440"/>
and innovate in and develop on top of ,
<Sync time="221.955"/>
and that this would lead to the best possible art emerging from this sort of
<Sync time="225.810"/>
uh marketplace of ideas , where everyone could compete freely without
<Sync time="230.075"/>
government protection for certain
<Sync time="231.690"/>
artists and certain ideas .
<Sync time="233.930"/>
so for these reasons , because we get more innovation ,
<Sync time="236.420"/>
because it would make your country more competitive ,
<Sync time="238.275"/>
and because we be- be- get better art ,
<Sync time="240.430"/>
we should abolish intellectual property rights .
<Sync time="242.750"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="243.460"/>
