we should introduce recall elections .
<Sync time="2.850"/>
so , to begin , we're going to give a model of how we think this would look ,
<Sync time="6.320"/>
and then we're going to explain the principle that this is based on ,
<Sync time="9.440"/>
before explaining how the pragmatic benefits would accumulate ,
<Sync time="12.465"/>
if we introduced recall elections .
<Sync time="14.190"/>
okay ,
<Sync time="14.675"/>
so , we think that recall elections are generally going to take place at the state level , we don't think
<Sync time="19.470"/>
that it is feasible to have a national recall election , but at least at the state level ,
<Sync time="23.500"/>
we think it would be initiated via
<Sync time="25.635"/>
a petition of twenty percent
<Sync time="27.700"/>
of registered voters
<Sync time="29.010"/>
in the area of the representative . so , what this means is that
<Sync time="32.630"/>
uh if
<Sync time="33.720"/>
some state legislature-
<Sync time="35.840"/>
uh if
<Sync time="36.480"/>
constituents of that person
<Sync time="38.000"/>
want to recall them , they would need to get a petition of twenty percent
<Sync time="42.030"/>
of the population that is registered to vote .
<Sync time="44.760"/>
which means that ,
<Sync time="45.715"/>
if you're child , you couldn't sign this petition , if you're not registered to vote you couldn't sign this petition ,
<Sync time="50.100"/>
and this is so that you ensure that those that have a stake
<Sync time="53.225"/>
in the election are those that can have a stake in the recall .
<Sync time="56.590"/>
okay , so we think that
<Sync time="58.150"/>
the principle behind this is very simple :
<Sync time="60.180"/>
we think that democracy ,
<Sync time="61.890"/>
while it is certainly flawed , is the best way
<Sync time="64.720"/>
to aggregate the preferences
<Sync time="66.465"/>
of the people . we think that term lengths are , in and of themselves ,
<Sync time="70.300"/>
arbitrary , and that
<Sync time="72.030"/>
allowing recall elections ,
<Sync time="73.810"/>
allows for people not to be
<Sync time="75.595"/>
uh bound by these terms lengths . we think that this is incredibly important , because oftentimes these term lengths ensure that individuals that become incredibly unpopular , uh
<Sync time="84.960"/>
elected officials with approval ratings below thirty percent , below forty percent ,
<Sync time="89.470"/>
people that simply don't have the trust of the public ,
<Sync time="92.170"/>
continue to stay in office . we think
<Sync time="94.660"/>
that this is problematic ,
<Sync time="96.140"/>
and while in some instances , we think that there may be
<Sync time="98.990"/>
uh a misuse of judgment ,
<Sync time="100.965"/>
by those that are recalling the person , in the vast majority of instances , we think
<Sync time="104.930"/>
when people would be recalled ,
<Sync time="106.815"/>
these are legitimate instances , in which that person
<Sync time="109.300"/>
is failing in their role
<Sync time="110.870"/>
as a rep-
<Sync time="112.500"/>
as a representative of the people , because they no longer represent
<Sync time="115.695"/>
the popular will
<Sync time="117.120"/>
of those that elected them .
<Sync time="118.580"/>
so , we think that there are some massive pragmatic gains that come from this ,
<Sync time="122.130"/>
in instances where there could be a recall .
<Sync time="124.240"/>
first , we think that there are instances in which
<Sync time="126.250"/>
uh elected officials are corrupt , and what this means is that
<Sync time="129.860"/>
when you recall these people ,
<Sync time="131.620"/>
you ensure that you're moving corrupt officials from office , and these are often instances in which there isn't enough evidence that this person would go to jail , or a legal process would be
<Sync time="139.515"/>
much longer than a recall process . we think that recall can ensure
<Sync time="143.185"/>
that corrupt officials are removed from office ,
<Sync time="145.510"/>
which is crucial to avoid an abuse of power .
<Sync time="148.500"/>
we also think that the potential of recall
<Sync time="150.840"/>
always holds elected officials to the fire .
<Sync time="153.830"/>
means that ,
<Sync time="154.580"/>
you know that you're not safe ,
<Sync time="156.360"/>
and you're not bound to your term , but rather
<Sync time="158.885"/>
if you are doing a poor job , if you're acting in a way
<Sync time="162.055"/>
in which individuals , that you are representing ,
<Sync time="164.930"/>
do not approve of what you're doing , you can be removed from office . and this is important , because oftentimes
<Sync time="170.215"/>
elected officials will behave in ways that go against their constituents ,
<Sync time="173.610"/>
but because the pubuli-
<Sync time="174.580"/>
the public memory is- is a
<Sync time="176.225"/>
very short term thing ,
<Sync time="178.390"/>
what this results is
<Sync time="179.610"/>
people shifting their position , once an election becomes closer ,
<Sync time="182.845"/>
and these individuals end up winning reelection . but , we think that this only involves
<Sync time="187.105"/>
a cycle of abuse , in which people are able
<Sync time="189.460"/>
to abuse the fact , that the public is not able to be constantly vigilant , and 
<Sync time="193.010"/>
constantly aware ,
<Sync time="194.090"/>
and they're not able to recall . what this means is that , if you have recall elections
<Sync time="198.045"/>
for the entirety of the term ,
<Sync time="199.870"/>
people are more likely to be representative
<Sync time="202.255"/>
of their constituents ,
<Sync time="203.640"/>
rather than them shifting to be representative
<Sync time="206.400"/>
when it comes time to have an election again .
<Sync time="208.390"/>
we simply think that a direct democracy
<Sync time="210.700"/>
leads to a more satisfied
<Sync time="212.510"/>
constituency , it leads to a voting body
<Sync time="214.825"/>
that is
<Sync time="215.350"/>
more likely to be happy with the actions of their elected officials ,
<Sync time="219.015"/>
and it ensures that in those cases , in which those elected officials have clearly failed
<Sync time="223.210"/>
to represent
<Sync time="224.170"/>
their people , the people that voted them into office ,
<Sync time="227.360"/>
we think that recall elections are invaluable tool .
<Sync time="230.130"/>
and for these reasons , we should introduce
<Sync time="232.070"/>
recall elections .
<Sync time="234.880"/>
