abstinence only sex education should be mandatory . 
<Sync time="4.870"/>
so basically by this we mean
<Sync time="7.400"/>
education for young people in secondary school
<Sync time="10.410"/>
that would teach them to wait until they're married
<Sync time="13.180"/>
before having sex .
<Sync time="15.330"/>
uh this is already common in certain parts of the united states
<Sync time="19.135"/>
but we think that it should be required everywhere in liberal countries .
<Sync time="23.270"/>
so a few reasons why we think this should be implemented :
<Sync time="26.405"/>
the first is that we think that
<Sync time="29.375"/>
abstinence only education has the power to prevent teenage pregnancies in many instances .
<Sync time="35.315"/>
the reason why is that if you implement
<Sync time="37.605"/>
a more comprehensive type of sex ed that teaches young people about birth control
<Sync time="42.075"/>
and
<Sync time="42.720"/>
other forms of safe sex practice , is that
<Sync time="45.435"/>
information will go in one ear and out the other . young people will hear that it's okay to have sex
<Sync time="50.645"/>
and not actually bother to learn how to put on a condom safely
<Sync time="54.145"/>
or not actually bother to take their birth control in a responsible way .
<Sync time="58.055"/>
and that ultimately what you've done is sexually empower people without actually giving them the information
<Sync time="63.320"/>
to be responsibly sexually empowered .
<Sync time="65.825"/>
this is likely to lead to many teen pregnancies and we've seen that in some school districts in america , i don't claim all but in some ,
<Sync time="72.955"/>
comprehensive sex education has coincided with a rise in sexual activity .
<Sync time="78.430"/>
given the tremendous harms , particularly to young girls 
<Sync time="81.710"/>
if they have children while they're still in high school ,
<Sync time="84.400"/>
many of them don't finish high school , they're much less likely to go to college ,
<Sync time="87.890"/>
uh their lives are effectively changed drastically for the negative if they do get pregnant . so we think that
<Sync time="93.065"/>
if there is a risk that comprehensive sex education
<Sync time="96.380"/>
does encourage people to have sex without actually being responsible ,
<Sync time="99.900"/>
then we should defer to having abstinence only sex education .
<Sync time="103.695"/>

<Sync time="104.740"/>
our second argument
<Sync time="105.845"/>
is that
<Sync time="106.810"/>
we should respect the democratic will
<Sync time="109.085"/>
in countries .
<Sync time="110.310"/>
so in the united states in particular ,
<Sync time="113.020"/>
a large part of people actually support having abstinence only sex education .
<Sync time="117.990"/>
so we think that if the public wants to have abstinence only sex education ,
<Sync time="122.220"/>
then it's not the government's place to decide that that's right or wrong for them .
<Sync time="126.810"/>
we think it's probably the case that government shouldn't dictate that one way of life is better than any other way of life .
<Sync time="132.610"/>
instead they should defer to what
<Sync time="134.040"/>
individual people want to do .
<Sync time="136.100"/>
but obviously some stance is necessary in terms of what we teach in public schools .
<Sync time="140.970"/>
at that point we think we should defer to what the majority of people think ,
<Sync time="144.820"/>
rather than having
<Sync time="145.885"/>
a minority of
<Sync time="147.355"/>
well educated elites make a decision about what's actually best for them .
<Sync time="151.360"/>
because these countries rely on democratic will for their legitimacy ,
<Sync time="155.050"/>
we think it's illegitimate to make
<Sync time="156.765"/>
decisions that are unpopular with the public
<Sync time="159.070"/>
on social matters .
<Sync time="161.850"/>
our third and final argument
<Sync time="163.345"/>
is that in a world where comprehensive sex ed
<Sync time="166.290"/>
and abstinence only sex ed were both followed ,
<Sync time="168.790"/>
we think that it would be a better world with abstinence only sex education .
<Sync time="172.705"/>
so we recognize , first of all , that neither program is going to be completely successful .
<Sync time="177.940"/>
that some young people will have sex even if we have abstinence only education .
<Sync time="182.180"/>
um
<Sync time="182.695"/>
but we think that ultimately if you could imagine a world where everyone was having safe sex in high school , in a world where no one was having sex in high school ,
<Sync time="190.610"/>
you would still have fewer teen pregnancies in the absence only world .
<Sync time="194.610"/>
at the point where that's our biggest concern , to prevent people from
<Sync time="197.520"/>
ruining their lives by having an unplanned teen pregnancy ,
<Sync time="201.080"/>
we should defer to abstinence only because when it is applied effectively it would mean no one
<Sync time="205.915"/>
had the potential to get pregnant .
<Sync time="208.040"/>
whereas
<Sync time="208.845"/>
of
<Sync time="209.535"/>
%hes a portion , a small portion admittedly , of people having the safe sex
<Sync time="213.710"/>
would actually get pregnant . 
<Sync time="215.180"/>
whether that be from , you know misuse of things like condoms and birth control .
<Sync time="218.870"/>
so
<Sync time="219.735"/>
ultimately we think that because you would have a better world if this were applied perfectly ,
<Sync time="224.050"/>
that it is a preferable policy to take . that we should try to do
<Sync time="227.175"/>
the best job possible with the best policy ,
<Sync time="229.960"/>
rather than implementing another policy that ,
<Sync time="232.235"/>
when both are applied imperfectly ,
<Sync time="234.360"/>
might sometimes be better .
<Sync time="236.350"/>
so for all these reasons
<Sync time="237.765"/>
we should have abstinence only sex education in secondary schools .
<Sync time="241.790"/>
thank you .
