this house would not subsidize biofuels . so in this debate we're arguing that the american government
<Sync time="6.230"/>
should not subsidize biofuels .
<Sync time="8.465"/>
we have four points in this debate .
<Sync time="11.000"/>
first , we think that the subsidy of biofuels undermines better alternative sources of energy .
<Sync time="17.710"/>
governments are uniquely poorly suited to pick winners and losers in industry .
<Sync time="22.540"/>
we think philosophically this is important to keep in mind ,
<Sync time="25.385"/>
that governments are always going to be made up of individuals who have their own interests
<Sync time="30.260"/>
at heart .
<Sync time="31.230"/>
so people who stand to make money on this are likely to support it
<Sync time="34.460"/>
and any implementation of this policy
<Sync time="36.720"/>
is likely to be done in such a way that individual congressmen
<Sync time="39.515"/>
make money .
<Sync time="40.755"/>

<Sync time="41.410"/>
but aside from that we tell you that
<Sync time="43.600"/>
it's very unlikely that government will correctly identify the best technologies to invest in .
<Sync time="48.230"/>
when you
<Sync time="48.870"/>
introduce all of these subsidies everyone wants to invest
<Sync time="51.715"/>
their research into getting those subsidies .
<Sync time="54.190"/>
this means that people are going to turn away
<Sync time="56.105"/>
from other technologies that might be more effective ,
<Sync time="58.580"/>
like better battery technology at
<Sync time="60.470"/>
actually reducing
<Sync time="61.835"/>
our dependence on biofuels .
<Sync time="64.110"/>
and this also creates a lock in effect . where once a lot of people use biofuels
<Sync time="68.465"/>
it's very difficult to transition to other sources of energy
<Sync time="71.560"/>
instead .
<Sync time="72.650"/>
so ultimately we might be left with a less efficient
<Sync time="75.620"/>
uh form of alternative energy
<Sync time="77.310"/>
than if we wait and let the market decide
<Sync time="79.390"/>
what we should adopt .
<Sync time="81.150"/>

<Sync time="81.920"/>
our second argument is that government money is fungible .
<Sync time="85.260"/>
what we mean by this is that giving money to corporations is not preferable to giving money to the american people . 
<Sync time="91.370"/>
recognize that this is basically corporate welfare . you say if you
<Sync time="95.125"/>
do the kind of production that we want ,
<Sync time="97.310"/>
we will subsidize you , we'll give you some money back .
<Sync time="99.885"/>
but that's money that isn't going to other programs like snap or wic which are important american social welfare programs .
<Sync time="106.640"/>
we think that ultimately
<Sync time="107.795"/>
even if you want to keep this money focused on climate change , things like
<Sync time="111.410"/>
providing for people who are displaced by climate change or cleaning up the damage of coal power plants et cetera ,
<Sync time="117.390"/>
would all be better uses of this money that have more immediate tangible impacts 
<Sync time="121.990"/>
for people on the ground 
<Sync time="123.500"/>
than giving handouts to large corporations
<Sync time="125.890"/>
that make cars with bio fuel .
<Sync time="128.355"/>

<Sync time="129.485"/>
our third argument is that this won't actually do anything to change the incentives of large oil companies .
<Sync time="135.250"/>
b_p , exxon ,
<Sync time="136.660"/>
whatever large oil companies the other side thinks are going to be harmed by this policy
<Sync time="141.115"/>
to reduce oil production
<Sync time="142.930"/>
actually won't change .
<Sync time="144.460"/>
international growth is the driver of increasing oil consumption .
<Sync time="148.330"/>
as people in places like india and china have a higher standard of living ,
<Sync time="152.340"/>
they're going to want cars , they're going to want things that rely
<Sync time="155.080"/>
on oil .
<Sync time="155.980"/>
the other team might say , oh , but they'll adopt biofuels as well .
<Sync time="159.065"/>
guess what ?
<Sync time="159.840"/>
india is already the leading user
<Sync time="161.830"/>
of alternative fuels like liquid natural gas , but that doesn't mean that they're oil demand
<Sync time="165.790"/>
isn't also increasing because of development .
<Sync time="168.510"/>
so what that means is that exxon and b_p will keep drilling the same amount of oil no matter what .
<Sync time="173.100"/>
and there's actually no solvency here to reduce
<Sync time="175.410"/>
carbon emissions because the oil is coming out of the ground
<Sync time="178.230"/>
either way .
<Sync time="180.240"/>
our last point in this debate is about what we just heard from rachel about
<Sync time="183.630"/>
international instability .
<Sync time="185.760"/>
so rachel tells us that ultimately it's good if we move to biofuels because it means that we're less dependent
<Sync time="191.635"/>
on
<Sync time="192.450"/>
middle eastern dictators . but i want to push back on this idea that saddam hussein or
<Sync time="197.085"/>
muammar qaddafi or whatever boogie man you prefer
<Sync time="199.960"/>
controls international oil .
<Sync time="202.110"/>
uh it's true that europe imports lots of oil , but most of it comes from russia 
<Sync time="206.870"/>
rather than the middle east . and in the united states essentially all of our oil
<Sync time="210.655"/>
comes from latin america
<Sync time="212.150"/>
or domestic production or canada .
<Sync time="214.580"/>
so what that means is the people you actually put pressure on , our putin in particular , uh
<Sync time="218.895"/>
the russians in general , 
<Sync time="220.750"/>
we saw that
<Sync time="221.660"/>
in the past the invasion of crimea was partly driven because putin needed to
<Sync time="225.890"/>
shore up his position as a leader
<Sync time="228.210"/>
because oil prices had fallen so the economy wasn't doing well .
<Sync time="231.890"/>

<Sync time="232.545"/>
so we think that ultimately strong men like putin or like middle eastern sheiks who rely on oil
<Sync time="238.150"/>
are forced to be more aggressive when you undermine their oil revenue
<Sync time="241.420"/>
and that this will lead to international instability
<Sync time="243.835"/>
which is a tremendous harm of this policy .
<Sync time="246.440"/>
so for these four reasons we would not subsidize biofuels .
<Sync time="249.800"/>
thank you .
