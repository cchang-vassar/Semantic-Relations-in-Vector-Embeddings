abstinence only sex education
<Sync time="2.775"/>
should not be mandatory .
<Sync time="4.790"/>
so ,
<Sync time="5.405"/>
in this debate we think that it's important to recognize that the whole purpose of having sex education
<Sync time="10.500"/>
should be for young people to learn how to be safe
<Sync time="13.870"/>
when having sexual intercourse , to understand how to be safe and to protect themselves
<Sync time="17.965"/>
from the potentiality
<Sync time="19.355"/>
of sexually transmitted diseases or an unwanted pregnancy
<Sync time="22.820"/>
both of which can be
<Sync time="23.770"/>
long term
<Sync time="24.670"/>
harms to the individual and can be incredibly traumatic whether it results in someone having
<Sync time="29.205"/>
a disease that they have to bear with ,
<Sync time="30.735"/>
a child that they didn't want ,
<Sync time="32.180"/>
or the possibility of having to get an abortion .
<Sync time="34.760"/>
all of which can be incredibly traumatic .
<Sync time="36.790"/>
we think that people are going to have sex . teenagers , young people , are going to have sex
<Sync time="41.865"/>
with or without
<Sync time="43.190"/>
se- with or without this type of sex education .
<Sync time="45.830"/>
we don't think that
<Sync time="46.560"/>
preaching abstinence only
<Sync time="47.985"/>
is going to be effective in stopping sex
<Sync time="49.900"/>
and we can see this empirically in the
<Sync time="51.470"/>
fact that
<Sync time="52.085"/>
in places in the united states in which
<Sync time="54.265"/>
abstinence only sex education
<Sync time="56.255"/>
is the only thing that is allowed ,
<Sync time="58.340"/>
there are the highest rates of
<Sync time="59.780"/>
unwanted teen pregnancies . it's because
<Sync time="62.290"/>
individual students especially , are not prone to listen to the moral preaching of teachers in their classroom
<Sync time="68.930"/>
especially if they're not being taught the sames things
<Sync time="71.255"/>
by their parents
<Sync time="72.055"/>
or maybe additionally when it's compounded by the same preaching
<Sync time="75.345"/>
they see at home .
<Sync time="76.200"/>
regardless ,
<Sync time="77.070"/>
we think that given that absence only sex education
<Sync time="79.775"/>
is not effective
<Sync time="81.080"/>
in resulting in having people
<Sync time="82.870"/>
practice abstinence only ,
<Sync time="84.795"/>
we think that it's important that you recognize
<Sync time="87.250"/>
the fact that people are going to have sexual intercourse , that they're going to be sexually active ,
<Sync time="91.895"/>
and that you respond to it .
<Sync time="93.080"/>
so that is our main argument . so why do we think
<Sync time="95.645"/>
that
<Sync time="96.335"/>
any other type of sexual education
<Sync time="98.400"/>
is going to be more effective ?
<Sync time="100.410"/>
so we think that
<Sync time="102.400"/>
any other type of sexual education is one ,
<Sync time="105.025"/>
less likely to result in unwanted pregnancies because
<Sync time="107.985"/>
if you teach people how to use condoms , if you teach people
<Sync time="111.265"/>
about the pe-
<Sync time="112.005"/>
potentiality for getting a diaphragm ,
<Sync time="114.200"/>
or for getting
<Sync time="115.200"/>
a birth control or the variety of other types
<Sync time="117.985"/>
of
<Sync time="118.540"/>
uh contraceptive that are available ,
<Sync time="120.400"/>
we think that these are things that can actually be very enlightening to
<Sync time="122.830"/>
people . most people that are starting to have sex
<Sync time="125.540"/>
don't know how to properly use a condom
<Sync time="127.340"/>
and they don't know
<Sync time="128.470"/>
about the effectiveness of other types of birth control or the rates of effectiveness . when you're unknowledgeable about these things ,
<Sync time="134.470"/>
you tend to learn from sources
<Sync time="136.150"/>
that are less reputable . some people learn about sex through
<Sync time="139.310"/>
porn , other people learn about it through
<Sync time="141.020"/>
older siblings
<Sync time="141.905"/>
but these are not reputable sources . we think it's much preferable to have someone
<Sync time="145.540"/>
that has knowledge of se-
<Sync time="147.635"/>
uh that has knowledge of contraceptive , knowledge
<Sync time="150.385"/>
of s_t_d's , these types of things to teach
<Sync time="152.750"/>
real information to students
<Sync time="154.430"/>
so they can make
<Sync time="155.160"/>
truly informed decisions . so they can really decide whether or not
<Sync time="158.700"/>
they're willing to take on the risks of these things
<Sync time="160.950"/>
when they choose to have sex .
<Sync time="163.530"/>
so we think that having individuals who are actually informed
<Sync time="166.710"/>
is more likely to result
<Sync time="168.125"/>
in a decline in s_t_d's and unwanted pregnancy
<Sync time="170.570"/>
which are obviously problematic . so why do you think the government
<Sync time="172.935"/>
has an obligation to inform ?
<Sync time="174.660"/>
first , we think that the government has it recognized responsibility to educate . this is seen in the fact that
<Sync time="179.695"/>
nearly
<Sync time="180.295"/>
every state
<Sync time="181.115"/>
has some sort of public education system for students .
<Sync time="183.820"/>
we don't think that
<Sync time="184.765"/>
the fact that we're talking about sex and not about math
<Sync time="187.660"/>
makes it any different . that there is still responsibility to educate given that both are crucial to a functional adult .
<Sync time="193.045"/>
secondly , we think that parents are simply not qualified in the same way that students often don't know
<Sync time="198.145"/>
that much about contraceptive and these types of things .
<Sync time="200.890"/>
parents are often uninformed and even when parents are informed ,
<Sync time="203.890"/>
they're often unlikely to tell these things to their children for a variety of reasons
<Sync time="207.870"/>
and finally ,
<Sync time="208.620"/>
we don't think that religion is impeded by a knowledge
<Sync time="211.360"/>
of contraceptive .
<Sync time="212.730"/>
just because you say the word condom
<Sync time="214.840"/>
doesn't mean that it violates the religious freedom
<Sync time="217.320"/>
of any person . it doesn't mean
<Sync time="218.955"/>
that you're endorsing children having underage sex , and it doesn't mean that you can't include the idea of abstinence
<Sync time="224.380"/>
in your sex education .
<Sync time="226.170"/>
just means that the government is fulfilling its responsibility to educate
<Sync time="229.425"/>
and fulfilling its responsibility
<Sync time="231.470"/>
to keep it citizens safe ,
<Sync time="232.990"/>
and for use reasons ,
<Sync time="234.450"/>
abstinence only sex education should not be mandatory .
<Sync time="238.080"/>
