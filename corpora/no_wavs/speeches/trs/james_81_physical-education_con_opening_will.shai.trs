physical education should not be mandatory .
<Sync time="3.940"/>
so we're going to explain to you why
<Sync time="6.040"/>
primary and secondary school students
<Sync time="8.530"/>
ought not be required to participate in
<Sync time="11.260"/>
gym or other physical education activities .
<Sync time="14.515"/>
we're obviously fine with letting people opt into it
<Sync time="17.180"/>
or with having optional after school sports ,
<Sync time="19.805"/>
but we don't think this should be compulsory .
<Sync time="22.195"/>

<Sync time="22.980"/>
our first argument is about when the state should intervene
<Sync time="26.180"/>
to make something compulsory .
<Sync time="27.950"/>
and this is what we heard from the last speaker about as well .
<Sync time="30.900"/>
we're going to propose a slightly different standard though .
<Sync time="34.105"/>
we think that the state should do something for people when there is
<Sync time="37.575"/>
an imbalance in power or information
<Sync time="40.620"/>
that the state needs to correct ,
<Sync time="42.425"/>
or when there are harms to third parties and i'll explain in a minute
<Sync time="46.410"/>
why i don't think that the objective good is a proper standard .
<Sync time="49.500"/>

<Sync time="50.090"/>
so why is there no information asymmetry
<Sync time="53.350"/>
in this instance ?
<Sync time="54.800"/>
we think first of all that children know , broadly speaking , that exercise is good for them
<Sync time="59.540"/>
even from a very young age .
<Sync time="61.710"/>
what's more , they know that sport is an important part of their lives and if they want to participate in sport .
<Sync time="66.960"/>

<Sync time="67.780"/>
but even if you think that children can't make these decisions for themselves or maybe that 
<Sync time="71.890"/>
you know  fifteen year olds can decide this but eight year olds can't , which might be fair ,
<Sync time="76.620"/>
we allow children's parents to correct for these
<Sync time="79.415"/>
imbalances in information all the time .
<Sync time="81.720"/>
certainly , every parent knows that exercise and sports are an important part of children's upbringing
<Sync time="87.670"/>
so we think that we should defer to letting parents make this decision
<Sync time="90.990"/>
rather than schools .
<Sync time="92.570"/>
after all every child has different needs and we think that parents ultimately know these
<Sync time="96.825"/>
better than the state .
<Sync time="98.670"/>
at the point where we let parents make decisions like whether or not their children are going to
<Sync time="102.475"/>
work during high school or how to name them or what religion to have them practice ,
<Sync time="106.990"/>
we think that we can also trust them to decide
<Sync time="109.085"/>
if their kids ought to play football or not .
<Sync time="112.250"/>
in terms of third party harms ,
<Sync time="114.720"/>
i just don't think that there are any harms to other groups because one set of individuals doesn't choose to
<Sync time="120.225"/>
exercise during primary school .
<Sync time="122.330"/>
at the end of the day this is a personal choice and we think that it ought be left to individuals .
<Sync time="127.690"/>
so there's no reason for the government to get involved .
<Sync time="130.250"/>

<Sync time="131.030"/>
now ,
<Sync time="131.500"/>
will talk about a third standard that i want to deal with real quick .
<Sync time="135.650"/>
he told you that
<Sync time="136.460"/>
an objective good
<Sync time="137.885"/>
is a proper standard for state intervention ,
<Sync time="140.600"/>
but i'll show you why this is absurd .
<Sync time="142.860"/>
it would be an objective good if everybody ran three miles every day and if we all put
<Sync time="147.630"/>
a very high premium on physical fitness .
<Sync time="150.700"/>
but the government doesn't tell thirty seven year olds that they have to go and run a five k everyday ,
<Sync time="156.005"/>
so why should we tell sixteen year olds that they have to do so ?
<Sync time="159.735"/>

<Sync time="160.250"/>
now it's true that we treat children differently from adults in some respects 
<Sync time="163.995"/>
but if you think that the absolute good
<Sync time="166.390"/>
is sufficient reason for the government to abrogate personal freedom ,
<Sync time="170.490"/>
then you should apply it to everyone and make everybody go out and play
<Sync time="173.740"/>
a game of soccer every saturday and run three miles every day .
<Sync time="177.640"/>

<Sync time="178.430"/>
since it's clear that we wouldn't do that , i don't see why this should apply to children as well
<Sync time="182.430"/>
i don't think that's a good standard for state intervention .
<Sync time="185.530"/>

<Sync time="186.600"/>
our second and final point
<Sync time="188.160"/>
is about the purpose of education .
<Sync time="190.230"/>
because let's remember
<Sync time="191.350"/>
we don't take all these kids away from their families and send them off to school for ten hours a day
<Sync time="196.570"/>
for fun .
<Sync time="197.540"/>
we do it because we need to train them as citizens
<Sync time="200.150"/>
and workers .
<Sync time="201.550"/>
this is why we train them in
<Sync time="203.355"/>
liberal arts skills , things like history and english so they can be better citizens ,
<Sync time="208.240"/>
and practical skills
<Sync time="209.930"/>
such as technical skills or computer skills
<Sync time="212.560"/>
so that they can go on to get good jobs .
<Sync time="215.170"/>
now i don't see how physical education directly contributes to this .
<Sync time="219.090"/>
it's true that people will be healthier
<Sync time="221.560"/>
in the long run if they do more physical education ,
<Sync time="224.075"/>
but it doesn't directly make them a better citizen .
<Sync time="226.890"/>
there are many people who
<Sync time="228.175"/>
are not physically fit who still vote and participate in public life .
<Sync time="232.255"/>
and it doesn't make them a better worker either . in the same way we see that many
<Sync time="236.330"/>
overweight people or disabled people are able to be good workers .
<Sync time="240.285"/>
so i just don't think that this fulfills the purposes that society sets for education
<Sync time="244.830"/>
and therefore it has no place in our schools .
<Sync time="247.760"/>
for all these reasons
<Sync time="248.850"/>
physical education should not be mandatory .
<Sync time="251.670"/>
thank you .
