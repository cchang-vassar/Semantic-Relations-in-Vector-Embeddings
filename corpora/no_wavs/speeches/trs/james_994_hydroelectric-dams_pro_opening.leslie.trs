we should further exploit hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="5.480"/>
so ,
<Sync time="6.230"/>
{hydroelectic--electric/hydroelectric}
<Sync time="6.975"/>
dams are just ordinary dams that produce electricity
<Sync time="10.820"/>
and by further exploit ,
<Sync time="12.050"/>
we think that countries around the world should seek to
<Sync time="15.355"/>
build hydroelectric dams preferentially ,
<Sync time="18.245"/>
relative to traditional
<Sync time="20.020"/>
sources of energy and at a greater rate than they're doing in the status quo .
<Sync time="23.920"/>

<Sync time="24.850"/>
so ,
<Sync time="25.515"/>
three big arguments for you . the first is about why we need to transition to renewable energy .
<Sync time="30.440"/>
so , the first question there would be :
<Sync time="32.470"/>
is hydroelectric power renewable ?
<Sync time="34.475"/>
but we see that
<Sync time="35.680"/>
rivers will continue to run whether or not we dam them ,
<Sync time="38.550"/>
so it seems very likely that
<Sync time="40.140"/>
this is a sustainable form of energy
<Sync time="42.310"/>
in the long term ,
<Sync time="43.590"/>
and it's one that doesn't involve any sort of pollution .
<Sync time="46.515"/>
it is true that
<Sync time="47.740"/>
hydroelectric dams may disrupt the flow of water .
<Sync time="50.990"/>
it may be damaging , say , to migratory fish ,
<Sync time="53.720"/>
but we see that there are ways to work around this . we might disable a hydroelectric power plant during a migration by animals ,
<Sync time="60.070"/>
or we might come up with a way for fish to bypass it .
<Sync time="62.940"/>
uh there're there are these little steps that salmon can jump up they use at some
<Sync time="66.890"/>
hydroelectric dams up in alaska ,
<Sync time="69.030"/>
for instance .
<Sync time="69.990"/>
scientists are clever . i'm sure that they'll be able to come up with a workaround here .
<Sync time="74.070"/>
we think that it's essential , though , that we transition to green energy
<Sync time="76.885"/>
to reduce our carbon emissions .
<Sync time="78.970"/>
the population is only growing and , particularly ,
<Sync time="81.810"/>
as regions like china and india develop and these people have a higher quality of life ,
<Sync time="86.670"/>
they're going to demand more access to energy .
<Sync time="89.120"/>
we need to ensure that that energy is provided in the cleanest way possible ,
<Sync time="92.990"/>
which means building things like hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="96.210"/>

<Sync time="96.780"/>
the other great advantage of hydroelectric dams
<Sync time="99.090"/>
is that you can build them
<Sync time="100.190"/>
on almost any river in the world .
<Sync time="102.350"/>
uh wind power only works where you have strong wind currents , so that might be good in massachusetts , but not so good in florida .
<Sync time="108.955"/>
and solar power , of course , relies on getting lots of sun which means that as you move further north ,
<Sync time="113.820"/>
it's less and less useful .
<Sync time="115.510"/>
hydroelectric power can be used almost anywhere in the world , so we think that it is the type of green energy that we ought most invest
<Sync time="121.545"/>
our efforts into .
<Sync time="123.430"/>
our second argument is about energy independence .
<Sync time="127.430"/>
many countries around the world rely on their neighbors for electricity production .
<Sync time="132.040"/>
to use a benign example ,
<Sync time="133.580"/>
germany
<Sync time="134.335"/>
recently closed down lots of nuclear power plants after the fukushima disaster in japan ,
<Sync time="139.405"/>
and now they buy electricity from france , where it's produced
<Sync time="143.190"/>
by nuclear power plants .
<Sync time="145.140"/>
i thought it was a bit funny , but
<Sync time="146.770"/>
what's important here is that
<Sync time="148.440"/>
countries can improve on their energy independence
<Sync time="152.030"/>
through further exploitation
<Sync time="153.555"/>
of hydroelectric dams . a country like
<Sync time="155.715"/>
egypt , for instance , that's built
<Sync time="157.450"/>
massive dam projects in the past , has reduced their dependence on the international community
<Sync time="162.060"/>
for energy .
<Sync time="162.920"/>
we think that
<Sync time="163.610"/>
by building hydroelectric dams , you therefore
<Sync time="165.870"/>
strengthen your own economy because you avoid
<Sync time="168.310"/>
uh imports , and you also create
<Sync time="170.950"/>
skilled
<Sync time="171.840"/>
jobs in the form of the engineers who would work at these plants
<Sync time="175.205"/>
and , in addition , you create work
<Sync time="177.135"/>
in terms of constructing these hydroelectric dams , etcetera . we think that it would be
<Sync time="181.150"/>
a stimulus for the economy .
<Sync time="183.485"/>

<Sync time="184.235"/>
and our last argument is that we think that it is a wasted opportunity when rivers flow
<Sync time="188.970"/>
undammed .
<Sync time="189.975"/>
recognize that the energy that a river contains when it flows to the sea is being spent one way or the other .
<Sync time="196.280"/>
if you build a hydroelectric dam , then that energy can go to powering
<Sync time="199.565"/>
hospitals and schools and houses . and if you don't ,
<Sync time="202.555"/>
then that energy goes to pushing some sand around
<Sync time="205.345"/>
at the bottom of an estuary .
<Sync time="207.575"/>

<Sync time="208.590"/>
we think that it's important
<Sync time="209.940"/>
that we don't waste energy . it's a finite resource , however much of it that there may be
<Sync time="214.755"/>
in nature .
<Sync time="215.950"/>
given that
<Sync time="217.025"/>
our potential to spend energy in the future is going to ro-
<Sync time="220.570"/>
grow exponentially it seems ,
<Sync time="222.490"/>
it has certainly grown exponentially since the beginning of the nineteenth century ,
<Sync time="226.260"/>
we think that we need to take every effort now
<Sync time="228.550"/>
to harness as much of the earth's energy as possible
<Sync time="231.120"/>
so that future people may have a higher quality of life
<Sync time="233.985"/>
and a better standard of living
<Sync time="235.520"/>
and that , ultimately , it would be a wasted opportunity
<Sync time="237.990"/>
not to further exploit these hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="241.030"/>
so because it's a
<Sync time="242.045"/>
good form of green energy ,
<Sync time="243.440"/>
because it promotes energy independence ,
<Sync time="245.405"/>
and because not to do so would be a wasted opportunity ,
<Sync time="248.180"/>
we should further exploit hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="250.550"/>
thank you .
