so we think it's probably fine
<Sync time="2.840"/>
when governments are
<Sync time="4.170"/>
unwilling to take in hardcore criminals who have
<Sync time="7.180"/>
actively like committed crimes like homicide or actively violent crimes ,
<Sync time="11.910"/>
but we think the debate we're having is whether you should limit asylum %hes
<Sync time="15.220"/>
asylum
<Sync time="16.150"/>
against those who have been
<Sync time="17.335"/>
discriminated against in their home countries
<Sync time="19.815"/>
and those who like face imminent threats .
<Sync time="21.920"/>
like obviously we don't care if you stolen something from a store or if you have a misdemeanor ,
<Sync time="27.120"/>
it's more about whether or not you need to be safer
<Sync time="30.410"/>
need to get away from your current situation .
<Sync time="32.780"/>
two main areas of clash : the first on the obligations of western liberal democra-
<Sync time="36.920"/>
democracies .
<Sync time="38.110"/>
although the state is an institution ,
<Sync time="40.550"/>
it's also
<Sync time="41.575"/>
made up of individual people
<Sync time="43.465"/>
that have obligations to each other .
<Sync time="45.490"/>
one of the obligations is to assist others when it comes at little to no cost to yourself .
<Sync time="50.770"/>
this is because the circumstances that provide
<Sync time="53.060"/>
one person with a better life than another
<Sync time="55.215"/>
are random .
<Sync time="56.115"/>
but also because in capitalist systems
<Sync time="58.390"/>
those who profit often do so by oppressing others .
<Sync time="61.220"/>
so the people escaping political subjugation in china
<Sync time="64.620"/>
are often the same people that people in the u_s are profiting off of
<Sync time="67.695"/>
when we outsource our corporation to chin- to china
<Sync time="70.955"/>
and encourage the exploitative government .
<Sync time="73.270"/>
we also think that western liberal democracies
<Sync time="75.860"/>
are more specifically obligated to developing countries and their citizens
<Sync time="79.835"/>
because they often are partially responsible for their circumstances .
<Sync time="83.310"/>
like america literally created isis when they shipped off weapons to like r- rebel groups in iran ,
<Sync time="89.710"/>
and the britons litter- and the brits literally destroyed african independence
<Sync time="93.485"/>
by redrawing the borders
<Sync time="95.020"/>
and just kind of colonizing all over the place .
<Sync time="97.960"/>
same with india .
<Sync time="99.460"/>
when states cause the problems of others ,
<Sync time="101.720"/>
we think they have an obligation to assist with the consequences
<Sync time="104.800"/>
given that they caused them .
<Sync time="107.120"/>

<Sync time="107.745"/>
we think that taking in those affected by their actions is an effective way to do so ,
<Sync time="112.700"/>
and like possibly one of the best ways in so far as you are saving lives
<Sync time="116.440"/>
without wi- like with
<Sync time="117.530"/>
minimum
<Sync time="118.390"/>
expenditure on yourself . like we think
<Sync time="120.170"/>
a really important thing in this round
<Sync time="121.760"/>
is that states aren't actually harmed
<Sync time="124.315"/>
by
<Sync time="124.950"/>
taking in more immigrants . like
<Sync time="127.015"/>
sure , there are arguments about why it might be difficult for your welfare system but all of these things
<Sync time="131.860"/>
even out over time .
<Sync time="133.390"/>
like we had many studies that have shown
<Sync time="135.655"/>
that immigrants , when integrated ,
<Sync time="137.350"/>
actually become very productive members of society ,
<Sync time="140.140"/>
and
<Sync time="140.555"/>
give birth to children that become very productive members of society .
<Sync time="143.760"/>

<Sync time="144.775"/>
our second area of clash has to do with the arbitrary nature of citizenship .
<Sync time="149.020"/>
because even if you think that obligations
<Sync time="151.190"/>
occur first to your citizens ,
<Sync time="152.675"/>
we don't think that applies if the way by which people can be citizens
<Sync time="156.250"/>
is arbitrary
<Sync time="157.725"/>
and there is no like fixed standard by which we measure .
<Sync time="161.290"/>
so both the standards that we currently use
<Sync time="164.240"/>
a- don't really make sense , right ? because either the standard is that you were born in that state
<Sync time="168.310"/>
or the standard is that you're related by blood to someone else .
<Sync time="171.560"/>
neither of these things are something that like you as a fetus or you as an unborn child
<Sync time="176.330"/>
can actually control .
<Sync time="178.230"/>
you're born within borders
<Sync time="179.570"/>
you didn't decide ,
<Sync time="180.890"/>
that in many cases of like countries
<Sync time="182.980"/>
or continents such as africa or asia
<Sync time="185.220"/>
were drawn by other imperialist states .
<Sync time="187.400"/>
you have limited mobility , it's like very difficult to just
<Sync time="190.185"/>
choose to live in a comfortable situation 
<Sync time="192.525"/>
because you are often blocked by your own government and by your own means .
<Sync time="196.370"/>
so if i don't have enough money i cannot escape .
<Sync time="199.490"/>
but also because of immigra-
<Sync time="201.120"/>
immigration regulations such as what we're talking about right now .
<Sync time="204.440"/>
you're often also born into a class that you can't get out of because of societal circumstances .
<Sync time="209.200"/>
so at the point that literally none of these things are things that i can opt into
<Sync time="213.655"/>
or like things that i can even comprehend , it's just something that i am placed
<Sync time="217.170"/>
into when i am born ,
<Sync time="218.365"/>
we don't think that there's actually meaningful fair standard by which we ascribe citizens
<Sync time="222.760"/>
and therefore it's impossible for states to have obliga- obligations to them
<Sync time="226.630"/>
first .
<Sync time="227.610"/>
this honestly makes the government's policy 
<Sync time="229.880"/>
quite discriminatory
<Sync time="231.270"/>
insofar as it says : 
<Sync time="232.410"/>
" based on this
<Sync time="233.190"/>
arbitrary factor that you were born within these drawn lines ,
<Sync time="236.630"/>
then you get to have
<Sync time="238.370"/>
then you get to have access to like better goods and resources
<Sync time="242.120"/>
where as everyone who is arbitrarily outside of those lines ,
<Sync time="245.430"/>
well , screw you . " we think that obligation exists not to citizens but to any human equally
<Sync time="250.950"/>
unless , you ought not limit amnesty .
<Sync time="253.020"/>
for these reasons proud to
<Sync time="254.935"/>
oppose .
<Sync time="256.720"/>
