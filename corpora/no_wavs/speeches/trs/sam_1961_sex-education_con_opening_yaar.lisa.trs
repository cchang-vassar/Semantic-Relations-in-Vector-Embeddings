i stand in
<Sync time="1.640"/>
firm opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.780"/>
sex education should be mandatory .
<Sync time="6.450"/>
although sex education is very helpful
<Sync time="9.120"/>
for the vast majority of students who learn it ,
<Sync time="12.030"/>
forcing it down the throats of conservative or otherwise
<Sync time="15.720"/>
oppositional parents
<Sync time="17.310"/>
does little more than
<Sync time="18.430"/>
ostracize particular students
<Sync time="20.530"/>
and
<Sync time="21.215"/>
push parents to create worse learning environments for their children .
<Sync time="25.470"/>
i have two overviews
<Sync time="26.995"/>
before two arguments .
<Sync time="28.950"/>
my first overview is just addressing the whole of yaar's speech
<Sync time="32.330"/>
because we do not hear a single reason about why comprehensive sex education
<Sync time="36.285"/>
is more beneficial
<Sync time="37.480"/>
than abstinence only or other forms of sex education .
<Sync time="40.840"/>
at the point where we don't get a meaningful benefit to sex education
<Sync time="44.960"/>
it is impossible to vote in favor
<Sync time="46.975"/>
of making it mandatory .
<Sync time="48.400"/>
essentially ,
<Sync time="49.075"/>
forcing the government to use violence
<Sync time="51.130"/>
or other methods of enforcing a particular ideology
<Sync time="54.660"/>
upon schools .
<Sync time="56.070"/>
now my second overview is just
<Sync time="58.360"/>
addressing what the status quo
<Sync time="59.800"/>
actually is
<Sync time="60.895"/>
because
<Sync time="61.520"/>
in
<Sync time="61.930"/>
every single moderate place , in every single place that is liberal ,
<Sync time="65.620"/>
we see comprehensive sex education .
<Sync time="67.760"/>
the vast majority of states and municipalities have accepted
<Sync time="71.320"/>
comprehensive sex education
<Sync time="72.855"/>
as the best form
<Sync time="74.755"/>
for their children .
<Sync time="76.010"/>
however , certain areas have accepted that
<Sync time="78.270"/>
abstinence only will be more effective .
<Sync time="80.680"/>

<Sync time="81.410"/>
there are nuances which can only be appreciated
<Sync time="84.270"/>
by those individuals
<Sync time="85.775"/>
from the district in which we are making the decision .
<Sync time="88.810"/>
pushing a
<Sync time="89.710"/>
unnuanced and universal ideology upon these people will likely have disastrous repercussions
<Sync time="96.010"/>
but the
<Sync time="96.595"/>
main purpose of this overview is simply saying
<Sync time="99.305"/>
in the places where sex education would go off without a hitch ,
<Sync time="103.040"/>
it is already occurring .
<Sync time="104.410"/>
in all others ,
<Sync time="105.510"/>
the two arguments i'm about to make ,
<Sync time="107.190"/>
will be actualized .
<Sync time="108.810"/>
first , i want to address the role of schools .
<Sync time="111.445"/>
for many students
<Sync time="112.600"/>
sex education makes them uncomfortable .
<Sync time="114.670"/>
whether it's a religious opposition , whether it's a personal opposition , when they are taught sex education they feel unsafe in the area that they're in
<Sync time="121.930"/>
and are less likely to learn effectively .
<Sync time="124.515"/>
the result of this
<Sync time="126.465"/>
is that they are less likely to do well in school .
<Sync time="128.650"/>
if you feel like your school is pushing a particular ideology ,
<Sync time="131.830"/>
you are likely to rebel morally
<Sync time="133.580"/>
and ideologically
<Sync time="135.160"/>
against other teachings . if you feel unsafe or uncomfortable in the classroom yo- it's more difficult to focus .
<Sync time="140.470"/>
at the point where you cannot teach other essential
<Sync time="142.835"/>
essential topics
<Sync time="144.320"/>
such as math , english ,
<Sync time="146.155"/>
literature ,
<Sync time="147.375"/>

<Sync time="148.030"/>
pushing the a certain subject at the
<Sync time="150.250"/>
detriment of all of the others
<Sync time="152.490"/>
does little more than create a
<Sync time="155.385"/>
political system
<Sync time="157.660"/>
for schools
<Sync time="159.100"/>
which does not serve the genu-
<Sync time="160.800"/>
genuine purpose of schools which is educating their students .
<Sync time="164.840"/>
now my second argument
<Sync time="166.150"/>
is how parents will respond to sex education .
<Sync time="168.990"/>
for many parents sex education is a deal breaker .
<Sync time="172.130"/>
when a teacher tells their student this is the best way to have sex , this is the appropriate way to have sex ,
<Sync time="177.410"/>
the result is that parents will rebel .
<Sync time="179.815"/>
this can occur in a few ways .
<Sync time="181.570"/>
first ,
<Sync time="182.390"/>
in many areas they're less likely to volunteer or help their school in general .
<Sync time="187.070"/>
for many schools that you don't have a lot of money and do not have a lot of
<Sync time="190.550"/>
uh support from their district ,
<Sync time="192.450"/>
they need parent volunteers to be effective .
<Sync time="194.990"/>
pushing parents out of the classroom
<Sync time="197.040"/>
telling them that they are not welcome because their ideology does not fit that of the schools ,
<Sync time="201.200"/>
will harm the whole of the the school
<Sync time="203.875"/>
and generally lead to worse education
<Sync time="206.260"/>
but we will also see wide scale
<Sync time="208.900"/>
exoduses away from these uni-
<Sync time="210.800"/>
or from these schools .
<Sync time="212.410"/>
you'll see many parents putting their child
<Sync time="214.640"/>
in home schooling
<Sync time="215.910"/>
or an alternative private school as a result of this sort of policy .
<Sync time="219.595"/>
this is problematic on two fronts .
<Sync time="222.070"/>
first , if wealthier parents , those who can afford to
<Sync time="224.855"/>
put their students in other schools
<Sync time="226.860"/>
decide
<Sync time="227.730"/>
to take them out of public schools , there'll be major political
<Sync time="230.960"/>
uh shift away from public schools to private schools which will decrease funding for public schools
<Sync time="235.430"/>
forcing education further .
<Sync time="237.000"/>
additionally ,
<Sync time="237.815"/>
all those students who do not have parents who can afford to put them home schooling ,
<Sync time="241.880"/>
will face far worse education
<Sync time="243.740"/>
leaving them destitute and essentially without a future .
<Sync time="246.655"/>
this is the greatest harm that can be actualized upon these students and is it is not worth keeping some students sex education
<Sync time="252.630"/>
if others will be left
<Sync time="253.815"/>
out in the dry . for this reason ,
<Sync time="255.870"/>
sex education should not be mandatory .
<Sync time="258.190"/>
