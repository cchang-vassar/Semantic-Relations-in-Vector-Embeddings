<Sync time="0.000"/>
we should introduce goal line technology .
<Sync time="3.305"/>
and i guess that the question in this case should really be -
<Sync time="7.315"/>
why not ?
<Sync time="8.730"/>
meaning , i think that the
<Sync time="10.910"/>
main burden in this debate ,
<Sync time="13.740"/>
not like other debates , should primarily be
<Sync time="16.900"/>
on the opposition side
<Sync time="18.870"/>
to explain why not use
<Sync time="21.185"/>
this technological improvement
<Sync time="23.500"/>
that all it does
<Sync time="25.180"/>
is just make sure that referees are making less mistakes
<Sync time="29.055"/>
and the game gets a little fairer .
<Sync time="31.905"/>
we need to understand :
<Sync time="33.730"/>
no matter how good or experienced
<Sync time="37.220"/>
you uh a referee at a football match is ,
<Sync time="40.285"/>
he is still a human being and can still make mistakes .
<Sync time="43.800"/>
he's unable to see everything always and always be right .
<Sync time="47.180"/>
especially not
<Sync time="48.525"/>
when he runs around on the court side for ninety minutes straight
<Sync time="52.935"/>
and when there's a lot of pressure from the side of the fans and the teams and
<Sync time="57.540"/>
the coaches and so on .
<Sync time="59.435"/>
this is a recipe that can easily
<Sync time="62.070"/>
effect any man's judgment .
<Sync time="64.255"/>
we also need to understand
<Sync time="66.540"/>
that
<Sync time="67.550"/>
deci 
<Sync time="68.925"/>
%hes
<Sync time="69.455"/>
uh decisions such as this , like
<Sync time="71.585"/>
wa- was there a goal or not ,
<Sync time="73.580"/>
are often decision that mean
<Sync time="75.395"/>
a lot a lot of money for a lot a lot of people .
<Sync time="79.120"/>
so this , again ,
<Sync time="80.700"/>
adds to the pressure but it also makes this decision
<Sync time="83.830"/>
something of value .
<Sync time="85.720"/>
it's important to make it right .
<Sync time="88.300"/>
so eventually
<Sync time="89.590"/>
we don't think that this has anything to do , it's not like a
<Sync time="93.185"/>
moral question
<Sync time="95.190"/>
that's complicated and requires a human judgment in any form , it's a very
<Sync time="99.770"/>
technical question :
<Sync time="101.240"/>
did the ball cross the line or not ?
<Sync time="103.900"/>
and
<Sync time="104.365"/>
these are exactly the types of questions that a computer with sensors can know the answer to much better than
<Sync time="110.745"/>
humans do . 
<Sync time="112.385"/>
it can be argued that
<Sync time="115.055"/>
some of the beauty of the game
<Sync time="117.310"/>
is exactly the fact that it doesn't involve any technology
<Sync time="120.830"/>
and that somehow worth the occasional mistake ,
<Sync time="123.985"/>
but it's unclear why this is true when such mistakes are
<Sync time="128.490"/>
costing millions of dollars .
<Sync time="131.050"/>
and
<Sync time="131.855"/>
in addition we'd like to point out
<Sync time="134.160"/>
that
<Sync time="134.995"/>
the use of these
<Sync time="136.670"/>
assisting technologies
<Sync time="138.410"/>
is already a common
<Sync time="139.900"/>
practice in many many other sport fields .
<Sync time="143.580"/>
in tennis we can like
<Sync time="145.475"/>
a a player can challenge the decision off the referee and let the simulator
<Sync time="150.140"/>
determine whether
<Sync time="151.830"/>
like there was a point or not .
<Sync time="154.030"/>
in basketball referees often
<Sync time="156.325"/>
uh request to
<Sync time="158.400"/>
take a look at the cameras when they're uncertain about
<Sync time="161.710"/>
a certain thing .
<Sync time="163.105"/>
and we think that it would be extremely hard to argue that
<Sync time="166.915"/>
these games has become any less exciting or
<Sync time="170.865"/>
good than they were
<Sync time="173.340"/>
because like
<Sync time="174.710"/>
due to the use of this technology .
<Sync time="177.500"/>
so
<Sync time="178.290"/>
in conclusion ,
<Sync time="179.710"/>
we say that
<Sync time="180.975"/>
we are only talking about a very small change
<Sync time="184.405"/>
that's entire effect is that it prevents
<Sync time="188.015"/>
human errors ,
<Sync time="189.940"/>
prevents um regretful
<Sync time="192.520"/>
human errors ,
<Sync time="193.545"/>
and is making the game more fair
<Sync time="196.165"/>
to everyone .
<Sync time="197.560"/>
the burden is on the opposition side to tell us what on earth could possibly
<Sync time="202.310"/>
be wrong with that . please propose .
<Sync time="206.207"/>
