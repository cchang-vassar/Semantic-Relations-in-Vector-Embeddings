we should introduce recall elections .
<Sync time="3.290"/>
so in some u_s states , for instance ,
<Sync time="6.270"/>
if people living in that state think the governor is doing a poor job ,
<Sync time="9.925"/>
they can hold
<Sync time="10.970"/>
a referendum , and everyone votes on whether or not they want to keep the governor or recall him
<Sync time="15.490"/>
and then elect a new governor .
<Sync time="17.320"/>
we think that
<Sync time="18.325"/>
pretty much every liberal democracy
<Sync time="20.610"/>
should introduce similar policies .
<Sync time="22.810"/>
uh we've seen this take place in u_s states , like wisconsin ,
<Sync time="25.810"/>
in recent years .
<Sync time="27.010"/>
two arguments .
<Sync time="28.660"/>
the first is about accountability for politicians .
<Sync time="32.135"/>

<Sync time="33.290"/>
right now ,
<Sync time="34.370"/>
politicians talk a good talk during elections . they say that they're going to do things
<Sync time="38.500"/>
that the people actually care about .
<Sync time="40.660"/>
then they get into office and suddenly they're able to start filling their pockets ,
<Sync time="44.390"/>
and helping out their friends , and listening to big bi-
<Sync time="46.960"/>
business interests ,
<Sync time="48.205"/>
and basically ignore people until
<Sync time="50.475"/>
six months before the next election .
<Sync time="52.790"/>
there's no accountability for what you do
<Sync time="54.720"/>
except
<Sync time="55.860"/>
i- for the immediate period right before an election . because people ,
<Sync time="59.445"/>
generally speaking ,
<Sync time="60.565"/>
have to think about more recent information rather than something you did two years ago .
<Sync time="64.790"/>
but what this means is that if we implemented recall elections , you could remove politicians as they did
<Sync time="69.865"/>
bad things .
<Sync time="71.430"/>
ultimately , we think
<Sync time="72.380"/>
this has tremendous impacts for a few reasons .
<Sync time="75.140"/>
one ,
<Sync time="75.880"/>
it changes the decision-making
<Sync time="77.775"/>
of politicians up front .
<Sync time="79.650"/>
it's now
<Sync time="80.490"/>
harder to go into politics simply to fill your own pockets or to make money for your friends ,
<Sync time="85.560"/>
so we think that fewer
<Sync time="87.010"/>
bad people , basically , are going to be willing to go into politics .
<Sync time="91.110"/>
but secondly , we also think that it gives you more of an incentive to run on
<Sync time="95.020"/>
honest policies .
<Sync time="96.430"/>
candidates will have less of an incentive to oversell themselves or to promise things that they can't deliver
<Sync time="101.290"/>
if they know that they might be removed for failing to fulfill
<Sync time="103.965"/>
campaign promises .
<Sync time="105.500"/>
and thirdly , we think it's much more likely that
<Sync time="108.440"/>
the politicians who run will actually reflect the will
<Sync time="111.475"/>
of the constituents , that you'll have support for things like
<Sync time="114.435"/>
social welfare
<Sync time="115.690"/>
or policies that ordinary people in their districts want .
<Sync time="118.950"/>
the other team might try to tell you that this means politicians will
<Sync time="122.370"/>
change constantly in order to try to react to the latest polling data ,
<Sync time="126.175"/>
but i don't see why this is necessarily bad . we think politicians should react to what the people want ,
<Sync time="131.440"/>
even outside of an election year .
<Sync time="133.580"/>
it doesn't make much sense to me that simply because you win an election in two thousand sixteen ,
<Sync time="138.075"/>
you should have a mandate to do whatever you want until twenty twenty four .
<Sync time="141.490"/>
circumstances in the world change . why shouldn't your governments have to as well ?
<Sync time="145.530"/>
we can hold people accountable , we can make them be honest ,
<Sync time="148.405"/>
and we think that ultimately this leads to a healthier democracy .
<Sync time="152.080"/>

<Sync time="152.820"/>
which leads nicely into our second major argument
<Sync time="155.575"/>
about democratic engagement .
<Sync time="157.960"/>
right now , if you live in a liberal country ,
<Sync time="160.140"/>
there's really no reason to be engaged in politics between election years .
<Sync time="163.820"/>
nobody really cares about protesters , so you don't have any way to change anything
<Sync time="167.965"/>
in government if you don't like the way things are going .
<Sync time="170.665"/>
you can write to your congressman and things like that , but they don't have any reason to listen to you because
<Sync time="175.995"/>
they know that ultimately , as long as they're a little better than the other guy during election year ,
<Sync time="179.870"/>
that they don't have anything to worry about .
<Sync time="181.800"/>
but if you have the ability to have recall elections ,
<Sync time="185.350"/>
then suddenly it makes sense for people to be engaged
<Sync time="187.880"/>
throughout their lives rather than only every few years when there's an election .
<Sync time="191.995"/>

<Sync time="192.690"/>
if people are thinking about whether or not they want to recall a politician , then they need to inform themselves on the issues .
<Sync time="198.350"/>
so you create more of an incentive for people to be informed .
<Sync time="201.380"/>
but on top of that , you create an incentive for people to
<Sync time="204.205"/>
contact their elected officials , to think about who else could be governing them .
<Sync time="208.530"/>
and we think that this means that people will be more democratically engaged .
<Sync time="212.450"/>
a democracy really only works if people are
<Sync time="215.205"/>
voting ,
<Sync time="216.060"/>
if people are
<Sync time="217.150"/>
thinking about the issues , that people care and feel like they have a voice .
<Sync time="221.110"/>
it's a big problem right now and a reason why there's such low voter turnout in the west ,
<Sync time="225.150"/>
that people don't think they have a voice . they don't think their vote matters .
<Sync time="228.220"/>
we think that we shift that kind of decision-making
<Sync time="230.690"/>
on our side
<Sync time="231.940"/>
by encouraging people to participate
<Sync time="234.130"/>
in electoral politics and in democracy in between election years
<Sync time="237.805"/>
so that it matters much more to their ordinary day-to-day lives .
<Sync time="240.890"/>

<Sync time="241.410"/>
so because of accountability and because of democratic engagement ,
<Sync time="244.435"/>
we should introduce recall elections .
<Sync time="246.600"/>
thank you .
