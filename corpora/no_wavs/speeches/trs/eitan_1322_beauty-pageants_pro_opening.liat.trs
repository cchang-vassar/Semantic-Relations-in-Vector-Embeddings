one crucial thing to keep in mind throughout this debate .
<Sync time="3.280"/>
oppositions are going to tell you
<Sync time="4.915"/>
that the harms from beauty pageants
<Sync time="6.840"/>
aren't so greater , that they're not unique to beauty pageants .
<Sync time="10.870"/>
just remember while they're telling you this , that the
<Sync time="13.630"/>
benefit you get from beauty pageants
<Sync time="16.070"/>
is nonexistent .
<Sync time="17.460"/>
the benefit is the entertainment
<Sync time="19.920"/>
of men sitting at home , enjoying seeing women paraded in front of them .
<Sync time="24.550"/>
that's not a big enough benefit to excuse almost anything ,
<Sync time="28.015"/>
and we think the harms of beauty pageants are massive . two such harms :
<Sync time="32.050"/>
one , the perpetuation of negative north ,
<Sync time="34.405"/>
and two , on the self esteem
<Sync time="35.970"/>
in impressionable young women .
<Sync time="37.920"/>
let's start talking
<Sync time="38.910"/>
about perpetuation of negative norms .
<Sync time="41.560"/>
three such norms :
<Sync time="42.580"/>
one ,
<Sync time="42.940"/>
objectification .
<Sync time="44.170"/>
at the point at which women are paraded across the state
<Sync time="47.370"/>
diff-
<Sync time="47.740"/>
dressed up differently ,
<Sync time="49.440"/>
performing different acts ,
<Sync time="51.620"/>
always less-clothed ,
<Sync time="54.020"/>
always just for their beauty ,
<Sync time="56.710"/>
judged by a panel of
<Sync time="58.815"/>
women and men giving them
<Sync time="60.960"/>
literal number values based on how they look ,
<Sync time="64.550"/>
you're
<Sync time="65.050"/>
pushing women ever more into the box
<Sync time="67.760"/>
of an object ,
<Sync time="68.915"/>
of something that's to appro- be appreciated
<Sync time="71.265"/>
for what it looks like , as opposed to what it
<Sync time="74.145"/>
o- who it is or
<Sync time="76.015"/>
what they say or how they think .
<Sync time="78.180"/>
secondly ,
<Sync time="79.180"/>
you perpetuate
<Sync time="80.465"/>
rape culture . not because women are
<Sync time="82.535"/>
scantily clad , we think that's fine ,
<Sync time="84.825"/>
but because of the way you objectify women ,
<Sync time="87.445"/>
you perpetuate the notion that they exist for the appreciation
<Sync time="91.290"/>
and enjoyment of men .
<Sync time="93.325"/>

<Sync time="93.925"/>
once you perpetuate that notion ,
<Sync time="96.670"/>
you perpetuate the idea that it is
<Sync time="99.305"/>
within a man's rights
<Sync time="101.165"/>
to take what is his ,
<Sync time="102.545"/>
that he can use a woman for his
<Sync time="105.020"/>
enjoyment , because that's what they're doing up
<Sync time="107.625"/>
on stage
<Sync time="108.970"/>
in front of everyone .
<Sync time="111.020"/>
lastly ,
<Sync time="111.985"/>
it perpetuatea gender norms .
<Sync time="115.560"/>
it's not just that they're scantily clad ,
<Sync time="118.105"/>
it's not just that they're parading around ,
<Sync time="120.235"/>
but they always
<Sync time="121.465"/>
get voted on
<Sync time="123.315"/>
their ideals and
<Sync time="125.945"/>
supposedly what they
<Sync time="128.620"/>

<Sync time="129.215"/>
perform in their
<Sync time="130.800"/>
acts and their speeches .
<Sync time="132.560"/>
and you'd note that consistently over years ,
<Sync time="135.470"/>
the winners are people who talk about things like
<Sync time="137.850"/>
happiness and joyfulness and world peace ,
<Sync time="140.440"/>
and perform things like
<Sync time="142.130"/>
art and
<Sync time="143.565"/>
happy thinking . you've never seen a woman
<Sync time="146.180"/>
go up there and perform
<Sync time="148.035"/>
a chemist exper-
<Sync time="149.460"/>
experiment ,
<Sync time="150.260"/>
because that's just not
<Sync time="151.345"/>
ladylike . so we say it perpetuates gender norms . crucially , we're not saying that women up there
<Sync time="155.750"/>
didn't choose to be up there .
<Sync time="157.290"/>
we're saying that them being up there
<Sync time="159.250"/>
is harmful
<Sync time="160.025"/>
to women
<Sync time="160.660"/>
all over the world , and doing this harm to other people
<Sync time="163.540"/>
should be discontinued . secondly , let's talk about self esteem in impressionable
<Sync time="167.130"/>
young women .
<Sync time="168.610"/>
two things we say we think this does . one ,
<Sync time="170.910"/>
it ties
<Sync time="171.800"/>
self esteem to beauty .
<Sync time="173.980"/>
how does it do that ? using childhood tropes
<Sync time="176.800"/>
of value .
<Sync time="177.670"/>
things like 
<Sync time="178.585"/>
the word queen thrown around in beauty queen or princess ,
<Sync time="181.980"/>
things like a crown given to the winner and a sash given to everyone who participates .
<Sync time="186.240"/>
the ball that these people
<Sync time="187.810"/>
enter into ,
<Sync time="188.945"/>
all of this terminology , all of these tropes ,
<Sync time="192.310"/>
throw women back to the stories they were told us children
<Sync time="195.680"/>
and to the
<Sync time="196.690"/>
equations they create of what is valuable
<Sync time="200.035"/>
in this world .
<Sync time="201.010"/>
using that ,
<Sync time="201.915"/>
they portray value as
<Sync time="204.065"/>
external good looks . a second thing that they do is they set an unachlieva-
<Sync time="209.360"/>
unachievably high bar
<Sync time="211.110"/>
to this value , so they tell women you are to be valued based on how you look , they do this
<Sync time="215.800"/>
literally by value in women based on how their looks
<Sync time="218.660"/>
that they look in ,
<Sync time="219.600"/>
setting it to tropes of what should be important
<Sync time="222.225"/>
to women all around the world .
<Sync time="224.280"/>
and then they make that goal
<Sync time="226.490"/>
way too high to achieve , way too difficult .
<Sync time="229.160"/>
what does all this do ? it sets in depression , it sets in eating disorder , it sets in unhappiness .
<Sync time="234.050"/>
all of this for what ?
<Sync time="235.750"/>
so that a few people can enjoy watching
<Sync time="238.010"/>
a few pretty girls
<Sync time="239.250"/>
scamper around on stage . we don't think it's worth it .
<Sync time="242.400"/>
please cancel beauty pageants .
<Sync time="244.622"/>
