i stand in firm opposition to the motion
<Sync time="4.720"/>
we should end
<Sync time="5.900"/>
cheerleading .
<Sync time="7.175"/>
cheerleading is a sport
<Sync time="9.040"/>
just like any other .
<Sync time="10.590"/>
it has inherent value insofar as it allows young women and men in some cases
<Sync time="16.015"/>
to get outside ,
<Sync time="17.400"/>
exercise ,
<Sync time="18.420"/>
express themselves artistically .
<Sync time="21.200"/>
my opponent tries to tell you that cheerleading is inherently sexualized but it's unclear why cheerleading is anymore sexualized
<Sync time="28.270"/>
than dance , gymnastics ,
<Sync time="30.540"/>
or any other sport which
<Sync time="32.255"/>
sponsors women an-
<Sync time="34.170"/>
or features women in a way
<Sync time="35.660"/>
that does not require them to have full physical contact or to throw a ball through a hoop .
<Sync time="40.600"/>
to that end , we think that people being able to choose cheerleading ,
<Sync time="44.985"/>
giving someone an option for what they want to do will always be beneficial .
<Sync time="49.510"/>
this is my
<Sync time="50.570"/>
first argument , the value of individual preference
<Sync time="54.000"/>
because
<Sync time="54.480"/>
cheerleading would be bad if we forced every individual to do it .
<Sync time="58.165"/>
if i had no choice in the matter and had to be a cheerleader ,
<Sync time="61.460"/>
i would very likely dislike it .
<Sync time="63.470"/>
whoever , it is simply one of a myriad of options which we allow to young people
<Sync time="67.955"/>
in high school or even sometimes middle school .
<Sync time="70.520"/>

<Sync time="71.290"/>
this means the individuals who choose to go into cheerleading
<Sync time="74.790"/>
are those who have determined it will give them the
<Sync time="77.070"/>
greatest amount of benefits ,
<Sync time="78.930"/>
those who have a clear preference for this .
<Sync time="81.310"/>
the only clear moral system we can derive is one in which we value individual preference .
<Sync time="86.340"/>
we cannot express that there is some god above who gave us rights or preferences
<Sync time="90.580"/>
because that would inherently contradict other individual's religions
<Sync time="94.205"/>
and there's no way we could make a cohesive system out of it .
<Sync time="97.220"/>
similarly , we can't say that the state is wholly just in all of its actions
<Sync time="101.310"/>
because we think that it is
<Sync time="102.615"/>
equally fallible to the individual .
<Sync time="104.950"/>
to that end , the only system in which
<Sync time="107.755"/>
there is
<Sync time="108.250"/>
true
<Sync time="109.980"/>
universal value is one in which we
<Sync time="112.105"/>
give individuals preference and allow them to follow their preferences .
<Sync time="115.930"/>
by
<Sync time="116.515"/>
giving individuals the option of cheerleading , we inherently support this moral system
<Sync time="121.105"/>
and
<Sync time="121.795"/>
allow individuals to self-actualize more effectively .
<Sync time="125.520"/>
but my next two arguments
<Sync time="126.780"/>
are about how cheerleading has inherent value
<Sync time="129.280"/>
even if we were to say
<Sync time="130.330"/>
force everyone to do it .
<Sync time="132.070"/>
my next argument is about the value of athleticism .
<Sync time="135.135"/>
in the united states particularly ,
<Sync time="137.470"/>
we think obesity is a massive problem .
<Sync time="139.820"/>
as time goes on
<Sync time="140.960"/>
more and more young people suffer from being overweight or obese
<Sync time="144.630"/>
due in large part to a lack of physical activity .
<Sync time="148.250"/>
when the only option available to individuals
<Sync time="151.300"/>
it's full contact sports or essentially being on the computer all day ,
<Sync time="154.520"/>
we think individuals will
<Sync time="156.100"/>
ultimately make bad decisions . we think that full contact sports are regularly dangerous things like rugby ,
<Sync time="161.700"/>
um football , are very likely to cause long term damage
<Sync time="165.430"/>
particularly if individuals get concussions and
<Sync time="168.180"/>
sitting in front of the computer all day
<Sync time="169.880"/>
inherently makes individuals
<Sync time="172.020"/>
less healthy
<Sync time="173.400"/>
as they spend less time on their feet
<Sync time="175.300"/>
actually developing their muscles .
<Sync time="177.385"/>

<Sync time="178.500"/>
by allowing cheerleading we allow individuals a better avenue for athleticism ,
<Sync time="182.740"/>
allow them to learn how to throw other people ,
<Sync time="185.695"/>
become more flexible , and generally just be healthier .
<Sync time="189.170"/>
my final argument is the value of art
<Sync time="191.790"/>
because we think that cheerleading just like gymnastics and dance is a form of art .
<Sync time="196.150"/>
individuals come together
<Sync time="197.860"/>
and form routines which are very regularly
<Sync time="200.310"/>
intricate .
<Sync time="201.090"/>
they put incredible thought into this and
<Sync time="203.755"/>
ultimately are very impressive when they actually go on display .
<Sync time="207.720"/>
we think that cheerleading then is
<Sync time="209.840"/>
one of the most pure forms of art as it allows individuals to soar through the air in a way that is simply not available
<Sync time="217.125"/>
in other avenues .
<Sync time="218.780"/>
we think that the value of art comes from individuals
<Sync time="221.470"/>
individual preference first off , but also
<Sync time="223.870"/>
simply the miraculous , the splendid .
<Sync time="226.530"/>
we think that cheerleading falls into this category
<Sync time="229.300"/>
because it allows individuals to go beyond the regular means by working as a group and doing something truly
<Sync time="235.740"/>
uh miraculous .
<Sync time="237.070"/>
for this reason , we should not end cheerleading .
<Sync time="239.935"/>
