we should close
<Sync time="1.910"/>
the guantanamo bay detention camp
<Sync time="3.990"/>
because it is
<Sync time="4.910"/>
immoral ,
<Sync time="5.710"/>
it's bad policy ,
<Sync time="7.575"/>
and it
<Sync time="8.230"/>
ultimately just makes everything worse , and it
<Sync time="10.970"/>
uh makes the problem it's allegedly trying to solve ,
<Sync time="14.570"/>
like terrorism , a lot worse .
<Sync time="16.890"/>
so let's start by talking about why it's immoral .
<Sync time="19.280"/>
i think this is rather obvious .
<Sync time="21.110"/>
guantanamo bay detention camp was specifically created to be immoral . it was created to be immoral in that
<Sync time="27.305"/>
it was a place where it would be
<Sync time="29.210"/>
outside of regular u_s jurisdiction ,
<Sync time="32.160"/>
where people could be detained indefinitely ,
<Sync time="34.920"/>
where people didn't have any right
<Sync time="36.700"/>
to things like habeas
<Sync time="37.490"/>
corpus where they can um demand
<Sync time="39.710"/>
reason for why they are being detained .
<Sync time="42.000"/>
it could be indefinite ,
<Sync time="43.090"/>
there wouldn't be any kind of , trial there wouldn't be any
<Sync time="45.420"/>
kinds of appeals .
<Sync time="46.500"/>
uh interrogation methods
<Sync time="48.675"/>
could be uh as hostile or torturous as you want them to be ,
<Sync time="53.020"/>
so it could
<Sync time="53.560"/>
be something like torture , it could be
<Sync time="54.980"/>
worse . the guards could
<Sync time="56.625"/>
uh humiliate people , um
<Sync time="59.520"/>
and there's no real way to actually ensure that these people are being treated fairly , with dignity and respect ,
<Sync time="65.475"/>
that these people are actually guilty of any kind of crime ,
<Sync time="68.655"/>
that these people actually know where their life is going to be going , and
<Sync time="71.910"/>
things like that .
<Sync time="72.535"/>
so , obviously those are
<Sync time="75.030"/>
by themselves pretty
<Sync time="76.470"/>
bad reasons and immoral reason ,
<Sync time="78.340"/>
the reason why that
<Sync time="79.635"/>
we
<Sync time="80.330"/>
uh have protections against all of those things in americ-
<Sync time="83.210"/>
in uh
<Sync time="84.090"/>
any kind of like
<Sync time="85.305"/>
uh liberal democracy is because we look at those things as grotesque ,
<Sync time="89.500"/>
as essentially the epitome of injustice .
<Sync time="92.220"/>
um arbitrary convictions , arbitrary sentences , arbitrary imprisonment , and all of these things ,
<Sync time="97.970"/>
it's
<Sync time="98.430"/>
essentially the definition of
<Sync time="100.430"/>
despotism ,
<Sync time="101.260"/>
um and that's very , very bad .
<Sync time="103.050"/>
but i also think that this is bad on an international stage in a couple of ways .
<Sync time="108.225"/>
first because it um a lot of countries get very angry about that ,
<Sync time="112.015"/>
and rightly so .
<Sync time="113.030"/>
obviously cuba's angry because this is essentially land that should belong to cuba ,
<Sync time="117.710"/>
um and it's basically um
<Sync time="120.570"/>
like
<Sync time="121.020"/>
like if cuba was operating a detention facility for communist dissidents in
<Sync time="125.700"/>
like uh key west , florida ,
<Sync time="127.980"/>
i imagine the u_s would probably be pretty annoyed about that ,
<Sync time="130.660"/>
like
<Sync time="131.300"/>
it's like fair , i-
<Sync time="133.100"/>
it's not something that they want happening right on their shorelines .
<Sync time="136.540"/>
but additionally , um
<Sync time="139.195"/>
i think that this is also bad
<Sync time="141.460"/>
um a um
<Sync time="142.285"/>
a level for like allies , and
<Sync time="144.510"/>
people like that oftentimes condemn it because it's seen as
<Sync time="147.200"/>
very , very rights-violative .
<Sync time="148.925"/>
but
<Sync time="150.050"/>
finally , it's also bad because um
<Sync time="153.105"/>
it's ultimate um
<Sync time="154.790"/>
very powerful as a propaganda tool that shows why
<Sync time="158.055"/>
people like the
<Sync time="158.975"/>
united states need be fought in the first place .
<Sync time="161.490"/>
and they need to be fought because they engage in immoral tactics ,
<Sync time="164.880"/>
because they do things like
<Sync time="166.230"/>
torture muslims ,
<Sync time="167.230"/>
throw them into prisons without any kind of hope of
<Sync time="169.530"/>
detent- uh without any
<Sync time="171.020"/>
um actual knowing of that being guilty ,
<Sync time="173.870"/>
not really caring who it is or what they actually did , during this to
<Sync time="177.145"/>
possibly innocent people ,
<Sync time="178.790"/>
and maybe never returning them to home or if they do return to
<Sync time="182.250"/>
home ,
<Sync time="182.960"/>
possibly after they've been tortured for something that they didn't do .
<Sync time="186.155"/>
uh i can see why people get annoyed about that , and i can see why people can get radicalized about these kinds
<Sync time="191.650"/>
of things over time . so ,
<Sync time="192.760"/>
for all those reasons ,
<Sync time="193.740"/>
close guantanamo bay .
<Sync time="196.199"/>
