biofuels are great , and we should
<Sync time="2.490"/>
absolutely
<Sync time="3.100"/>
subsidize them ,
<Sync time="4.150"/>
because
<Sync time="4.990"/>
the uh subsidies are ultimately going to drive greater support , and investment , and innovation , and creation in this field ,
<Sync time="12.010"/>
which is going to be absolutely crucial
<Sync time="14.510"/>
for making sure that you get
<Sync time="16.770"/>
uh cheaper fuel sources , more {availables/available} and {accessibles/accessible} fuel sources sources , and greener
<Sync time="21.750"/>
fuel sources .
<Sync time="22.910"/>
so , let's
<Sync time="24.040"/>
uh break all of this down .
<Sync time="25.670"/>
first ,
<Sync time="26.140"/>
why do i think that uh government subsidies and investment in biofuels is
<Sync time="30.990"/>
crucial to its survival ?
<Sync time="32.560"/>
and i think that the reason for
<Sync time="33.730"/>
this is because , right now these are still growing technologies ,
<Sync time="37.730"/>
growing sources of alternative energy , that can be used to replace the uh
<Sync time="41.655"/>
currently ingrained uh like more standard sources of fuel , that we use .
<Sync time="46.465"/>
so ,
<Sync time="47.420"/>
i think that when the government subsidizes these things , it makes it much more economically feasible for people to try to make uh
<Sync time="54.040"/>
innovations in uh
<Sync time="55.250"/>
biofuels .
<Sync time="56.475"/>
that means trying to find ways to make biofuels cheaper ,
<Sync time="60.240"/>
um trying to find ways to make biofuels more efficient .
<Sync time="63.365"/>
uh
<Sync time="63.970"/>
these are all things that i think are incredibly important 
<Sync time="66.400"/>
for moving biofuels as a viable option
<Sync time="69.140"/>
forward ,
<Sync time="69.755"/>
but additionally i think that ,
<Sync time="71.910"/>
when you uh
<Sync time="73.675"/>
inve- when you subsidize biofuels , and just the process of bringing more people into it
<Sync time="78.330"/>
also creates more of an economies of scale ,
<Sync time="80.840"/>
for um
<Sync time="81.620"/>
uh
<Sync time="82.285"/>
for- it creates more of an economies of scale for biofuels .
<Sync time="85.400"/>
so , that , sense more people are going to now uh
<Sync time="88.080"/>
be working on it , and it's going to be um
<Sync time="90.415"/>
more production of it ,
<Sync time="91.850"/>
um and more like cost uh decreases
<Sync time="93.625"/>
it , and things like that , from the competition ,
<Sync time="96.460"/>
all of these are going to mean that , uh like at the next level , manufacturers are gonna be more incentivized to create things that accommodate biofuels ,
<Sync time="104.140"/>
uh and these
<Sync time="105.080"/>
set off like chain reaction in ways that , really ingrain biofuels as actual part of the economy .
<Sync time="110.960"/>
um
<Sync time="111.670"/>
so , i think that , that's going to be great , because
<Sync time="114.280"/>
first ,
<Sync time="115.220"/>
biofuels are just simply a lot more sustainable , and they're going to be a lot better for the climate .
<Sync time="120.195"/>
and ,
<Sync time="120.835"/>
this is , by itself , the most important thing that you can possibly consider in this debate ,
<Sync time="125.335"/>
because ,
<Sync time="126.265"/>
making sure that you have a cleaner source of energy , given how many like billions of
<Sync time="131.140"/>
billions of people around the world
<Sync time="133.520"/>
like uh drive , or uh give off some kind , or use some kind of
<Sync time="137.415"/>
non biofuel for like heating or anything else .
<Sync time="140.910"/>
this is a drastic way that you can
<Sync time="142.995"/>
uh decrease dependence on
<Sync time="145.120"/>
oftentimes like uh dirty uh pollutants , like coal , or
<Sync time="149.195"/>
having to
<Sync time="150.080"/>
like extract oil at a great environmental risk ,
<Sync time="153.500"/>
um or not having to release as much heat , or c_o two emissions into the atmosphere , which leads to global warming , and
<Sync time="159.710"/>
all those uh
<Sync time="161.105"/>
bad things associated with it ,
<Sync time="163.050"/>
all of that could be benefited .
<Sync time="164.550"/>
but , additionally i think that biofuel is going to be
<Sync time="167.425"/>
uh , when it's
<Sync time="168.640"/>
further developed , a lot more accessible , because anyone can use animal manure , or
<Sync time="173.645"/>
uh food scraps , or uh
<Sync time="175.880"/>
any other kinds of things , like uh plants ,
<Sync time="178.175"/>
any other kinds of things as fuel .
<Sync time="180.450"/>
these are things that are just wildly available- widely available , just about everywhere around the world .
<Sync time="185.310"/>
so , it also means that fuel is going to be a lot more accessible , it's not going to cost as much ,
<Sync time="189.770"/>
so if you're like a poor community , or if you're a poor country maybe ,
<Sync time="193.575"/>
uh it's going to be a lot cheaper for you to industrialize , uh and to gain access to a lot of resources ,
<Sync time="199.350"/>
because
<Sync time="200.160"/>

<Sync time="200.695"/>
cost of ener- basic energy are going to go down .
<Sync time="204.020"/>
uh and finally , i think that it's important to look at the bigger picture , about uh biofuel subsidies .
<Sync time="209.540"/>
because , at the end of the day , even if we're talking about like tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for biofuels ,
<Sync time="216.305"/>
the possible economic payoffs that we're talking about are
<Sync time="219.690"/>
uh
<Sync time="220.340"/>
essentially like invaluable , we're talking about the like saving of the world , in terms of climate change ,
<Sync time="225.950"/>
or billions of dollars in saving in energy costs being slashed entirely in the long run .
<Sync time="231.740"/>
uh and , at the end of the day , these kinds of investments just aren't that much money for a government to make . they're incredibly reasonable , and they have uh very likely a good payout .
<Sync time="240.735"/>
so , for all those reasons , we should subsidize biofuels .
<Sync time="245.569"/>
