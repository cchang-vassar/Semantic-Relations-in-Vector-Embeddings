the motion for today's debate is
<Sync time="2.780"/>
the united states should abolish the electoral college .
<Sync time="6.060"/>
two main areas of clash : the first on the true representation of people and what it means to be a democracy .
<Sync time="11.540"/>
we tell you that at it's core ,
<Sync time="12.940"/>
a democracy is about providing equal representation
<Sync time="15.655"/>
to all people living underneath that system .
<Sync time="18.380"/>
obviously the system isn't perfect .
<Sync time="20.590"/>
it is impossible to get every single person living within the united states into one room to come to a consensus on policy decisions .
<Sync time="27.450"/>
this is why we have systems that elect our representatives
<Sync time="30.320"/>
to make those decisions on our behalf .
<Sync time="32.635"/>

<Sync time="33.170"/>
but this doesn't change the fact that those representatives
<Sync time="35.540"/>
ought be as representative as possible 
<Sync time="38.410"/>
and actually represent the people who are voting them in .
<Sync time="40.815"/>
just as we recognize that it is
<Sync time="42.445"/>
bad when those with more money
<Sync time="44.350"/>
are able to lobby their way into more policy
<Sync time="46.980"/>
we also tell you that is antithetical to democracy to give people more votes based on their location .
<Sync time="52.225"/>
at the point that it is the fifth time
<Sync time="54.455"/>
that the {alectoral/electoral} college
<Sync time="56.260"/>
didn't match up to that of the popular vote 
<Sync time="58.425"/>
and someone was elected who wasn't
<Sync time="60.260"/>
truly chosen by ever- by the people
<Sync time="62.790"/>
through the majority .
<Sync time="63.785"/>
it is time to institute a system
<Sync time="65.495"/>
where the leader is truly chosen by the people .
<Sync time="68.140"/>
more than this ,
<Sync time="68.990"/>
we tell you that the old pragmatic arguments for the electoral college
<Sync time="72.460"/>
no longer exist .
<Sync time="74.180"/>
current technology allows us to make it for votes to be counted
<Sync time="77.130"/>
effectively
<Sync time="77.920"/>
with very low risk of fraud .
<Sync time="80.540"/>
which means
<Sync time="81.270"/>
that currently it is completely possible for us to have
<Sync time="84.100"/>
a more direct election of our presidents .
<Sync time="87.430"/>
more than this , we don't under- we think the winner takes all policy
<Sync time="90.920"/>
destroys individual voices and leads to the kind of apathy
<Sync time="94.335"/>
that we regret in the current status quo .
<Sync time="96.650"/>
i am unlikely to vote ,
<Sync time="98.670"/>
unlikely to care about the presidential election outcome ,
<Sync time="101.400"/>
because i live in a s- in a state
<Sync time="103.540"/>
where
<Sync time="103.990"/>
the vote is already decided because my state
<Sync time="106.780"/>
always votes
<Sync time="107.710"/>
blue .
<Sync time="108.245"/>
what this means is that even if i am a hardcore republican , i'm unlikely to show up to the polls because i know that my vote will not be represented
<Sync time="115.680"/>
in regards to what president
<Sync time="117.230"/>
actually gets chosen .
<Sync time="118.430"/>
secondary of clash has to do with
<Sync time="120.835"/>
what we think this affects societally .
<Sync time="123.095"/>
we tell you that the system in which
<Sync time="124.820"/>
every single state gets two representatives in addition to their population based
<Sync time="129.380"/>

<Sync time="129.980"/>
electoral college vote
<Sync time="131.400"/>
undervalue cities and allows rural areas with lower populations ,
<Sync time="135.580"/>
such as states like wyoming , to have
<Sync time="138.055"/>
every individual person's vote
<Sync time="140.060"/>
worth more than other people surrounding them .
<Sync time="142.480"/>
we tell you this is a problem on two levels .
<Sync time="144.490"/>
first , it's probably bad if
<Sync time="146.070"/>
just because i live in v- wyoming ,
<Sync time="147.925"/>
my vote matters four times more than someone living in new york .
<Sync time="151.120"/>
but more than just the principal reasoning as to why this is bad ,
<Sync time="154.300"/>
it's also problematic because wyoming is almost eighty five percent made up of white people ,
<Sync time="159.490"/>
whereas the majority of people of lower classes ,
<Sync time="162.015"/>
the majority of people of color
<Sync time="163.770"/>
are living in
<Sync time="164.475"/>
much more urban areas , in cities such as new york ,
<Sync time="167.470"/>
portland and philadelphia .
<Sync time="170.290"/>
the problem is
<Sync time="171.220"/>
that the electoral college system systematically undervalues the votes 
<Sync time="175.140"/>
people of color and minorities
<Sync time="177.120"/>
insofar as it places more votes on those who are living in
<Sync time="180.155"/>
less populated areas ,
<Sync time="181.810"/>
traditionally that are less populated as well
<Sync time="184.440"/>
by people of color .
<Sync time="186.080"/>
more than this , we tell you that the way that this changes campaigning
<Sync time="189.370"/>
means that instead of advocating for all states and all people equally ,
<Sync time="193.520"/>
what happens is that
<Sync time="194.950"/>
individual political parties
<Sync time="196.840"/>
will choose to advocate only to swing states because they know they are the only ones truly making decisions about the election 
<Sync time="202.640"/>
in regards to the electoral college .
<Sync time="204.680"/>
it means
<Sync time="205.435"/>
you pander your polic- not only do you only campaign in those areas
<Sync time="209.120"/>
but you also pander your policies to specific blocks that get you those states .
<Sync time="213.330"/>
for example ,
<Sync time="214.850"/>
getting in any given election where florida is a swing state ,
<Sync time="217.945"/>
it is much more likely that candidates will pander to the floridian elderly
<Sync time="221.820"/>
in order to try and get the electoral college state
<Sync time="224.260"/>
rather than looking at
<Sync time="225.430"/>
rising demographics of young liberals
<Sync time="227.790"/>
living in %hes highly populated cities .
<Sync time="230.480"/>
but more than this , the next step to this is that
<Sync time="233.335"/>
if you are a president who's trying to go for a second term ,
<Sync time="236.370"/>
there are certain stances you cannot take
<Sync time="238.360"/>
even they might if even if they might be politically preferable
<Sync time="241.360"/>
because you're afraid that you won't get elected for the next term 
<Sync time="244.670"/>
because of swing states . for example ,
<Sync time="247.525"/>
%hes few presidential candidates
<Sync time="249.745"/>
are likely to actually like
<Sync time="251.885"/>
actually repair our relations with cuba because they are afraid of losing
<Sync time="255.790"/>
c- floridian cubans and thus the floridian vote .
<Sync time="258.945"/>
for these reasons proud to propose .
<Sync time="261.570"/>
