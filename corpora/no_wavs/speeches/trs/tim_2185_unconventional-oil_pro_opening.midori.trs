we should further exploit
<Sync time="1.920"/>
unconventional oil .
<Sync time="3.410"/>
so in this debate we want to talk primarily about the benefits of 
<Sync time="6.730"/>
energy independence
<Sync time="8.040"/>
and we want to explain why ,
<Sync time="9.585"/>
in a world in which global warming is a fact at this point and
<Sync time="12.690"/>
not something that is going to be easily avoided ,
<Sync time="15.150"/>
we think it is beneficial for states to invest in
<Sync time="18.110"/>
unconventional oil such as
<Sync time="19.850"/>
uh oil sands and tar and things of that nature . uh
<Sync time="23.200"/>
moving forward . n- ok .
<Sync time="24.600"/>
so firstly ,
<Sync time="25.835"/>
under energy independence we want to talk about
<Sync time="28.420"/>
uh monopolies and opec . so we think that
<Sync time="31.050"/>
outside of unconventional oil possessions ,
<Sync time="34.040"/>
most oil , most conventional oil ,
<Sync time="36.125"/>
is controlled by
<Sync time="37.270"/>
the opec monopoly . and we think that the opec monopoly
<Sync time="40.085"/>
is a net bad in the world for a few reasons . firstly ,
<Sync time="43.330"/>
the countries that compose opec , largely countries in the middle east , authoritarian countries ,
<Sync time="47.910"/>
gain immense amounts of political clout because of the monopoly that they have
<Sync time="51.940"/>
in the status quo .
<Sync time="53.030"/>
opec , essentially , is able to act
<Sync time="54.850"/>
as a cartel and it gives
<Sync time="56.740"/>
more political power to regions and to countries
<Sync time="59.665"/>
that are
<Sync time="60.250"/>
bad countries in the world . what we mean by bad countries are these are home
<Sync time="63.830"/>
these are nations that
<Sync time="65.105"/>
fundamentally do not respect the rights of their citizens .
<Sync time="68.320"/>
countries like saudi arabia , countries like venezuela ,
<Sync time="71.130"/>
countries where human rights are not respected , where women's rights are not respected ,
<Sync time="75.130"/>
and we think that because they have this monopoly on oil there is very little that the international world can do
<Sync time="80.400"/>
to try and combat the human rights abuses that take place in these states
<Sync time="84.050"/>
because they can raise the prices of oil or they can embargo their oil
<Sync time="87.630"/>
like happened in the united states under jimmy carter where uh
<Sync time="90.420"/>
an oil embargo took place and
<Sync time="92.340"/>
opec refused to sell to the united states .
<Sync time="94.720"/>
we think by
<Sync time="95.785"/>
exploiting unconventional sources of oil
<Sync time="98.410"/>
more international action can be taken against these countries which is a good ,
<Sync time="102.275"/>
and further we think that opec is essentially
<Sync time="104.850"/>
a price manipulator which means that
<Sync time="106.975"/>
uh the prices that are being charged in the status quo c-
<Sync time="109.870"/>
for conventional oil
<Sync time="111.530"/>
do not match what a
<Sync time="112.755"/>
fair market would breed . so we think that
<Sync time="114.860"/>
unconventional oil
<Sync time="116.340"/>
also has its benefits outside of opec . we think that firstly ,
<Sync time="119.770"/>
unconventional oil
<Sync time="120.820"/>
increases the supply of oil
<Sync time="122.975"/>
and it drives down prices for everyone .
<Sync time="125.200"/>
this means that even if you aren't working in the industry ,
<Sync time="128.130"/>
that your oil prices are going to go down 
<Sync time="130.230"/>
and that there are large benefits for all citizens with a nation because everyone
<Sync time="134.250"/>
is either on the grid that is powered by conventional oil
<Sync time="137.295"/>
or uses
<Sync time="138.310"/>
products such as cars
<Sync time="139.560"/>
that require this type of oil .
<Sync time="141.410"/>
we also think that it incentivizes
<Sync time="143.295"/>
businesses and job creation
<Sync time="145.330"/>
if you exploit unconventional oil . in the status quo , the u_s job market
<Sync time="149.380"/>
and other job markets are doing fairly well but they've started to stagnate
<Sync time="152.550"/>
especially for unskilled workers .
<Sync time="154.500"/>
we think that introducing unconventional oil industry is
<Sync time="157.310"/>
getting
<Sync time="157.865"/>
to
<Sync time="158.195"/>
increase jobs particularly for people like these people
<Sync time="161.045"/>
that have been pushed out of manual labor fields ,
<Sync time="163.470"/>
such as mining and other areas ,
<Sync time="165.335"/>
we think that
<Sync time="166.130"/>
unconventional oil can bring jobs back to those unskilled laborers
<Sync time="169.565"/>
in particular which is something that we think
<Sync time="171.725"/>
the economy
<Sync time="173.210"/>
desperately needs .
<Sync time="174.810"/>
finally we think that energy independence
<Sync time="177.520"/>
keeps profits
<Sync time="178.585"/>
in the country .
<Sync time="179.660"/>
in the status quo , oil profits ,
<Sync time="181.605"/>
for the most part ,
<Sync time="182.680"/>
go outside of the country . they're lost to our g_d_p
<Sync time="185.395"/>
and the money that otherwise could of been reinvested
<Sync time="188.270"/>
by putting that money in american pockets by providing it to american job creators ,
<Sync time="192.680"/>
or you know domestic job creators , that money can then be reinvested further into the market %hes
<Sync time="197.345"/>
and can gradually increase the g_d_p as money continues to be exchanged .
<Sync time="201.410"/>
we think that
<Sync time="202.350"/>
that is a preferable world to the one in which all of our oil money , all the money that is spent in conventional oil , billions of dollars every year ,
<Sync time="209.570"/>
continues to flood
<Sync time="210.700"/>
outside of the domestic
<Sync time="212.330"/>
uh economy
<Sync time="213.215"/>
and we think that we get a all around
<Sync time="215.460"/>
healthier economy and all around
<Sync time="217.655"/>
better economy especially for unskilled workers
<Sync time="220.260"/>
if we invest in unconventional oil .
<Sync time="222.020"/>
we recognize that global warming is a problem but we don't think that this
<Sync time="225.195"/>
is a meaningful tipping point in making it worse , and for these reasons
<Sync time="228.690"/>
we should further exploit 
<Sync time="230.175"/>
unconventional oil .
<Sync time="232.095"/>
