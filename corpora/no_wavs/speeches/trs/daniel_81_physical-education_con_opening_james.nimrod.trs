physical education should not be mandatory ,
<Sync time="4.130"/>
and obviously physical education ,
<Sync time="6.570"/>
the reason why physical education shouldn't be mandatory
<Sync time="9.530"/>
isn't because
<Sync time="10.220"/>
exercise is bad ,
<Sync time="11.630"/>
obviously exercise is a good thing .
<Sync time="13.730"/>
if anything ,
<Sync time="14.600"/>
people clearly don't do it enough in the status quo , and i think that one of the big culprits for this
<Sync time="19.465"/>
is because of the way in which pe- you give people a false sense of actually working out , even though it's oftentimes
<Sync time="25.530"/>
ah happening
<Sync time="26.470"/>
grossly ineffectively , and in the worst way possible .
<Sync time="29.490"/>
so ,
<Sync time="30.110"/>
first , why do i think p_e class is one of the absolute worst ways in which you
<Sync time="34.750"/>
absolute eh at which you can get a workout ?
<Sync time="37.260"/>
first , because it's a like a pretty short amount of time , like maybe the class will be like
<Sync time="41.400"/>
fifty minutes long usually ,
<Sync time="43.285"/>
you take maybe like your ten to fifteen minutes to change into your gym clothes anyway ,
<Sync time="47.710"/>
they do attendance for another five minutes , than you do n-
<Sync time="50.240"/>
like you like mess around for another ten minutes probably .
<Sync time="52.830"/>
like at the end of the day , you're not really doing all that much .
<Sync time="56.000"/>
ah additionally ,
<Sync time="57.350"/>
p_e oftentimes isn't all that enjoyable for people , and it's not that enjoyable for people , because
<Sync time="62.365"/>
different people like to exercise in different ways .
<Sync time="64.900"/>
some people may want to play soccer , some people may want to just run ,
<Sync time="68.400"/>
other people may want to like play basketball , other people
<Sync time="72.010"/>
may want to play like
<Sync time="72.990"/>
four square ,
<Sync time="74.080"/>
or ah play field like ho- like , there's endless ways in which people can like
<Sync time="78.055"/>
ac- like be active
<Sync time="79.325"/>
physically .
<Sync time="80.525"/>
um
<Sync time="81.295"/>
and p_e, as like a mandatory p_e class ,
<Sync time="84.230"/>
it necessarily requires it
<Sync time="85.870"/>
to either
<Sync time="86.380"/>
a , be structured and like
<Sync time="88.850"/>
boring and unified , which is going to make a lot of people think that
<Sync time="92.355"/>
working out is this boring 
<Sync time="93.680"/>
thing that they don't enjoy , or
<Sync time="95.540"/>
b , it's just going to lead to like this decentralized chaos , where
<Sync time="98.860"/>
people can just kind of like
<Sync time="99.960"/>
use the time to talk to friends while like walking around on a track
<Sync time="103.500"/>
outside ,
<Sync time="104.370"/>
which isn't actually
<Sync time="105.680"/>
helping anyone .
<Sync time="107.800"/>
um
<Sync time="108.405"/>
additionally , like the final reason , why p_e class is like the worst time to get a work out , is because like
<Sync time="113.240"/>
people- nobody wants to have this exercise in the middle of the day , like
<Sync time="117.270"/>
nobody wants to actually try that hard , because like it's is not fun to sit in class gross and sweaty for the rest of the day ,
<Sync time="124.165"/>
after you go to the gym .
<Sync time="126.140"/>
uh that's not enjoyable , nobody wants to like smell or feel sweaty all day , like you just don't feel good when you're in your class you don't want to put in that effort .
<Sync time="134.480"/>
but additionally like , when you're in school , you're focusing on other things , are focusing on your grades and your academics and the like ,
<Sync time="140.870"/>
uh and you're preoccupied , you're not really thinking about like yeah flex ,
<Sync time="144.220"/>
things like that uh .
<Sync time="145.490"/>
so , that's not important , like you should leave it a like like recess is a good enough time to get this
<Sync time="149.885"/>
break .
<Sync time="150.495"/>
um and secondarily like ,
<Sync time="152.645"/>
the second reason why p_e therefore shouldn't be mandatory is like , all this comes in conjunction with
<Sync time="157.510"/>
in assumption that p_e ,
<Sync time="158.875"/>
which is bad as i just talked about ,
<Sync time="161.455"/>
this is a suitable replacement for actually working out , which is bad .
<Sync time="166.270"/>
uh and the reason for that , is because like
<Sync time="168.250"/>
if like if you spend like your time in p_e class today , like you like did a little bit of physical activity ,
<Sync time="174.080"/>
in your mind , especially after like a long and tiring day at school ,
<Sync time="178.590"/>
when you already feel gross and sweaty , because you worked out ,
<Sync time="181.285"/>
you are probably not going to feel like you need to work out more , you're probably not going to exercise more on your own , or play like a game after school with your friends , like a sport ,
<Sync time="191.400"/>
you might be less likely to do these things , because you feel tired and stressed out ,
<Sync time="194.885"/>
but also because you feel like you're already working out , you're already doing enough work out ,
<Sync time="199.880"/>
um and clearly that's not true .
<Sync time="202.170"/>
it creates this like illusion of solvency for a problem , and it means that you're less likely to actually more effectively work out .
<Sync time="207.860"/>
uh so for all those reasons ,
<Sync time="209.650"/>
p_e should not be mandatory .
<Sync time="212.489"/>
