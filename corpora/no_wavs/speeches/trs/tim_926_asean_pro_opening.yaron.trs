we should disband {eysian/asean} .
<Sync time="2.420"/>
in the status quo
<Sync time="3.800"/>
{eysian/asean} is a system of southeast asian nations organizing
<Sync time="7.510"/>
into a system that allows for economic progress ,
<Sync time="10.350"/>
growth and trade
<Sync time="11.515"/>
for the whole region . it allows
<Sync time="13.105"/>
for unification between the region in making economic
<Sync time="16.060"/>
and localized decisions .
<Sync time="17.955"/>
we think that both the structure and the pragmatic outcomes of what we've seen
<Sync time="22.450"/>
from {eysian/asean} are not good ,
<Sync time="24.180"/>
and that it should be disbanded because of that .
<Sync time="26.255"/>
firstly ,
<Sync time="27.265"/>
the structural flaws that make
<Sync time="28.895"/>
even the concept of this type of union
<Sync time="31.050"/>
problematic in the way that it currently exists .
<Sync time="33.440"/>
firstly ,
<Sync time="34.205"/>
it ties nations to the economic growth of others , which we think especially in developing countries like those in southeast asia
<Sync time="40.530"/>
is incredibly problematic ,
<Sync time="42.110"/>
firstly , because these developing nations often have the most {tumultuous/tumultruous} econom-
<Sync time="46.395"/>
uh economies , which means that
<Sync time="48.280"/>
if one nation goes down ,
<Sync time="49.910"/>
it's likely going to drag down the development
<Sync time="51.875"/>
of other nations , and secondly ,
<Sync time="53.635"/>
it means that you can't have as much specialization
<Sync time="56.385"/>
and diversity in in uh and what these countries are doing
<Sync time="59.125"/>
when they're all following similar labor standards .
<Sync time="61.960"/>
uh but more importantly ,
<Sync time="63.300"/>
%hes the method of making decisions only through consensus in the {eysian/asean} ,
<Sync time="66.700"/>
which means that any big differences and changes that need to be made
<Sync time="70.830"/>
to
<Sync time="71.220"/>
political or economic decisions which are likely to occur
<Sync time="74.530"/>
in an ever changing world that's based on a technological revolution
<Sync time="78.035"/>
that is changing what the markets look like on a day to day basis ,
<Sync time="81.360"/>
we think that this type of
<Sync time="82.590"/>
oaky
<Sync time="83.245"/>
and saturated system in which every country needs to agree
<Sync time="86.455"/>
on what is best
<Sync time="87.520"/>
is only going to hold
<Sync time="88.630"/>
every country back .
<Sync time="90.010"/>
it's going to make them less able to adapt to a changing environment ,
<Sync time="93.890"/>
uh economic environment in the future ,
<Sync time="95.895"/>
and we think that this only makes these countries more vulnerable to exploitation
<Sync time="99.740"/>
in the long run .
<Sync time="100.760"/>
but the second problem
<Sync time="102.270"/>
is how {eysian/asean} actually behaves ,
<Sync time="103.875"/>
because in the status quo ,
<Sync time="105.760"/>
{eysian/asean} services a
<Sync time="106.900"/>
front that allows countries to protect themselves
<Sync time="109.280"/>
from the human rights and labor abuses
<Sync time="111.280"/>
that exist . for example ,
<Sync time="112.980"/>
in the status quo ,
<Sync time="114.110"/>
there are massive human rights abuses in places like myanmar
<Sync time="117.235"/>
and uh
<Sync time="117.885"/>
in other countries in southeast asia ,
<Sync time="120.180"/>
uh for example ,
<Sync time="121.240"/>
uh a boat was being sent between two different countries in southeast asia
<Sync time="125.530"/>
that carried refugees from myanmar
<Sync time="127.605"/>
in recent uh
<Sync time="128.540"/>
in recent months ,
<Sync time="129.710"/>
in which no country was willing to take these people , in which no country was willing to take these people in ,
<Sync time="134.985"/>
and every country
<Sync time="136.230"/>
created this atmosphere and created uh
<Sync time="138.320"/>
an environment
<Sync time="139.325"/>
in which this type of practice was unacceptable .
<Sync time="141.950"/>
further ,
<Sync time="142.810"/>
actual slaughters and human rights abuses ,
<Sync time="145.290"/>
real murders ,
<Sync time="146.460"/>
real harms are occurring to the people in these countries . the governments of these of many of these countries
<Sync time="151.005"/>
are dictatorial in nature ,
<Sync time="152.735"/>
and are impressing the people that exists in these regions .
<Sync time="155.400"/>
when these countries close each other off
<Sync time="157.710"/>
from outsiders
<Sync time="158.945"/>
and allow for themselves to focus within their own economic sector ,
<Sync time="162.750"/>
their own political sector through the {eysian/asean} ,
<Sync time="165.330"/>
it makes these countries
<Sync time="166.580"/>
less susceptible to the influences
<Sync time="168.765"/>
of other voices , moderating force such as the united states and the european union ,
<Sync time="173.380"/>
that may be allow- uh that may help
<Sync time="175.540"/>
protect people from these human rights abuses
<Sync time="178.085"/>
in the status quo .
<Sync time="179.470"/>
we think that the best way to protect these people is to disband this network that allows for the protection of abuses as they exist in the status quo ,
<Sync time="186.860"/>
and we think that that is incredibly important ,
<Sync time="189.140"/>
that that is the most important
<Sync time="190.845"/>
because it ensures that people on the ground , the real people that are impacted by the economic policies
<Sync time="196.175"/>
of {eysian/asean} , are not being
<Sync time="197.870"/>
harmed in the process .
<Sync time="199.645"/>

<Sync time="200.210"/>
and finally , on labor .
<Sync time="201.690"/>
labor practices in these countries
<Sync time="203.760"/>
are control- uh
<Sync time="205.590"/>
are also incredibly problematic ,
<Sync time="207.840"/>
and it makes it , because these are all a regional area ,
<Sync time="210.420"/>
makes it very difficult for labor to move from nation to nation
<Sync time="213.640"/>
when the labor standards in each country
<Sync time="215.880"/>
are so deplorable .
<Sync time="217.180"/>
when people aren't able to move out of their country and find better labor standards
<Sync time="221.080"/>
across the
<Sync time="221.815"/>
uh across the border , aren't able to move to any reasonable place to find better labor standards ,
<Sync time="226.485"/>
it allows every country to lower its labor standards , which not only harms the people that exist ,
<Sync time="231.620"/>
but also it decreases the level of productivity in these economies , which has a second
<Sync time="236.720"/>
uh secondary negative effect
<Sync time="238.380"/>
on these countries .
<Sync time="239.790"/>
given that
<Sync time="240.445"/>
the system of {eysian/asean} itself
<Sync time="242.525"/>
is horribly bloated ,
<Sync time="243.895"/>
and that the impacts only allow for abuses of the people ,
<Sync time="247.380"/>
we think we should disband
<Sync time="248.990"/>
{eysian/asean} .
<Sync time="249.930"/>
