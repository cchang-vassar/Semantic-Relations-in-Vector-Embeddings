we should ban
<Sync time="2.090"/>
anonymous posts .
<Sync time="3.850"/>
so what we're arguing is that
<Sync time="5.670"/>
websites like reddit
<Sync time="7.130"/>
or four chan should not allow people to post anonymously ,
<Sync time="11.050"/>
they should require them to log in with their real name .
<Sync time="13.750"/>
we would be fine with using something like facebook as a way to authenticate people's identity
<Sync time="18.275"/>
or even having some sort of government issued identity
<Sync time="20.945"/>
which people will be required to use when they post online .
<Sync time="24.340"/>
three arguments for our side :
<Sync time="26.680"/>
the first is about tracking crime .
<Sync time="29.510"/>
imagine how much more difficult it would be to distribute illegal materials
<Sync time="33.825"/>
if everything you posted online were directly linked to your name .
<Sync time="37.100"/>
if i had to go and post james l. next every pirated movie i've ever watched ,
<Sync time="42.000"/>
then it's probably much less likely that i'd be willing to engage in that behavior .
<Sync time="45.865"/>
and pirated movies are honestly the least of our concerns on the internet .
<Sync time="49.770"/>
when there are people out there distributing indecent photos of minors 
<Sync time="53.105"/>
or drug paraphernalia
<Sync time="54.830"/>
or lots of other things that they couldn't distribute in person ,
<Sync time="57.810"/>
we think that ultimately it's very difficult to track and limit if their distribu-
<Sync time="61.620"/>
distribution is anonymous .
<Sync time="63.580"/>
if everyone had to use their real name and if there were no way to get around this ,
<Sync time="67.160"/>
then ultimately we think it would be easier for law enforcement to go after these people .
<Sync time="71.260"/>
i think that part- in particular , for indecent material concerning children ,
<Sync time="75.480"/>
this is just so outrageous that it's been allowed to go on in the name of allowing anonymity .
<Sync time="79.980"/>
it's essential that government step in to do something in order to protect children who are being harmed
<Sync time="84.910"/>
and in order to go after the people who are creating and distributing
<Sync time="88.220"/>
this heinous material .
<Sync time="89.720"/>
we think that that , in and of itself ,
<Sync time="91.610"/>
is enough to ban
<Sync time="92.780"/>
these anonymous posts .
<Sync time="95.140"/>
our second argument is about self censorship .
<Sync time="98.330"/>

<Sync time="98.830"/>
you may have asked yourself , if you ever read the comments on youtube ,
<Sync time="102.150"/>
why are people so much more horrible on the internet than they are in person ?
<Sync time="106.560"/>
people who would never dream of using racial slurs or sexist language on the metro
<Sync time="111.590"/>
are perfectly happy using it
<Sync time="113.345"/>
on youtube or on other anonymous posting services .
<Sync time="116.960"/>
we think that people are encouraged to self censor when they use their own name .
<Sync time="121.750"/>
why ? 
<Sync time="122.445"/>
your reputation and your standing in the community
<Sync time="125.480"/>
is tied to your
<Sync time="126.975"/>
language , is tied to do with you treat other people .
<Sync time="129.725"/>

<Sync time="130.380"/>
but if the community ,
<Sync time="131.700"/>
so called community , is made up of anonymous posters ,
<Sync time="134.970"/>
then
<Sync time="135.380"/>
you have nothing to lose by being an absolutely atrocious human being .
<Sync time="139.200"/>
you can say anything you want and do anything you want and get away with it ,
<Sync time="143.325"/>
and no one will think that you're being
<Sync time="145.230"/>
inappropriate , and no one will judge you for that behavior .
<Sync time="148.690"/>
so ultimately if people's real name were tied to their post , we think it's much more likely that they would behave civilly .
<Sync time="154.425"/>
and we see that this happens in person . people are generally
<Sync time="157.410"/>
much more affable and pleasant in person than they are online .
<Sync time="161.260"/>

<Sync time="162.150"/>
this could be because of the reputation or also because when other posters
<Sync time="166.225"/>
have a photo of themselves have their real name
<Sync time="168.960"/>
you're more likely to remember that there are people too and that they deserve your respect .
<Sync time="172.760"/>
just like when you interact with another human being ,
<Sync time="175.120"/>
you aren't just polite to them because you don't want to look like a jerk ,
<Sync time="178.235"/>
but also because you care about them as another human being .
<Sync time="181.350"/>
we think that tying into this
<Sync time="182.560"/>
empathy and also to this shame
<Sync time="184.430"/>
would ultimately reduce the amount of hate speech ,
<Sync time="186.850"/>
reduce the amount of racism , reduce the amount of awfulness on the internet in general ,
<Sync time="191.245"/>
that this would make the internet a more accessible place for people of different backgrounds
<Sync time="195.585"/>
and that ultimately this would also be enough to justify
<Sync time="198.725"/>
requiring people to post with their name
<Sync time="201.080"/>
rather than anonymously .
<Sync time="203.620"/>
our final argument
<Sync time="204.850"/>
might seem a bit perverse at first , but it's about preventing doxing
<Sync time="208.575"/>
doxing is when an otherwise anonymous community
<Sync time="211.600"/>
publishes the name and real world information about an individual in that community .
<Sync time="216.690"/>

<Sync time="217.230"/>
presumably the reason there's a threat here , is because there's an imbalance now . one person is a known quantity 
<Sync time="223.080"/>
the other people remain anonymous .
<Sync time="225.220"/>
if everyone were a known quantity then there wouldn't be any benefit to doxing people .
<Sync time="229.815"/>
we think that this would prevent hate groups from using this as a tool to intimidate people 
<Sync time="234.200"/>
and prevent them from speaking on line ,
<Sync time="236.125"/>
which is something that we see groups like anonymous do right now .
<Sync time="239.085"/>
for all of these reasons
<Sync time="240.860"/>
we believe therefore that you should ban anonymous posts .
<Sync time="244.110"/>
thank you .
