we should not
<Sync time="1.450"/>
further exploit unconventional oil .
<Sync time="3.745"/>
so we're going to explain to you why
<Sync time="6.360"/>
oil resources like tar sand should not be further exploited
<Sync time="10.050"/>
for their energy .
<Sync time="12.040"/>
our first point is about how this prolongs oil dependence and ultimately makes our environmental situation
<Sync time="18.430"/>
all the more dire .
<Sync time="20.085"/>

<Sync time="20.790"/>
when
<Sync time="21.460"/>
we first started hearing a lot about peak oil in the early two thousands from people like al gore and the anti-global warming movement ,
<Sync time="29.175"/>
one of the ideas that was proposed was that society would naturally move towards renewable resources
<Sync time="35.700"/>
as oil prices grew .
<Sync time="37.690"/>
and we saw that
<Sync time="38.770"/>
over the course of the two thousands ,
<Sync time="40.710"/>
oil prices continued to increase
<Sync time="42.730"/>
until
<Sync time="43.310"/>
many people in the u_s were clamoring for some alternative because they could no longer afford oil .
<Sync time="48.345"/>
and the same became true
<Sync time="49.890"/>
in other countries around the world , although oil prices have generally been higher
<Sync time="53.755"/>
in europe than in the u_s .
<Sync time="55.965"/>
but what's happened in the last few years as a result of the discovery and exploitation
<Sync time="61.230"/>
of tar sands and other
<Sync time="63.245"/>
alternative sources of oil
<Sync time="64.930"/>
is that the political and social pressure in favor of renewable energy has been dampened .
<Sync time="70.665"/>
what this means is any momentum that was built up in the two thousands in favor of things like
<Sync time="75.980"/>
alternative ways to power cars
<Sync time="77.990"/>
has died back due to the
<Sync time="79.490"/>
influx and glut ,
<Sync time="81.100"/>
basically , of american oil .
<Sync time="83.495"/>
in particular , the united states for thirty years was the world's largest importer of oil
<Sync time="89.180"/>
and because of that , there was a strong movement within the u_s to build alternative energy so that this country
<Sync time="94.590"/>
would be
<Sync time="95.660"/>
energy independent . and so we saw the u_s as a leader
<Sync time="99.170"/>
for alternative energy .
<Sync time="100.890"/>
but now the united state has actually become one of the world's largest oil exporters
<Sync time="105.570"/>
due to opening up
<Sync time="106.700"/>
alternative oil in north dakota and alaska .
<Sync time="110.010"/>
so what we see is that the united states has now become
<Sync time="112.535"/>
a global
<Sync time="113.565"/>
enemy , basically , of alternative energy .
<Sync time="115.750"/>
i- we're not investing money into this and we're making it less profitable for foreign companies , be they in
<Sync time="120.855"/>
japan or germany ,
<Sync time="122.440"/>
to ultimately do this , because they don't have access to that american market
<Sync time="125.920"/>
as long as oil remains very cheap .
<Sync time="128.390"/>
so in the long term , this is going to harm our ability to pivot to green energy
<Sync time="132.365"/>
and prolong the effects
<Sync time="134.010"/>
of
<Sync time="134.590"/>
massive oil use .
<Sync time="136.570"/>
therefore , we should not exploit
<Sync time="138.205"/>
these tar sands and other resources .
<Sync time="141.670"/>
our second argument is that these alternative sources of oil are more harmful than the
<Sync time="146.375"/>
easy oil of texas or saudi arabia .
<Sync time="149.970"/>
in order to access tar sands and many of the other
<Sync time="153.075"/>
sources of oil that we're talking about in this debate ,
<Sync time="155.965"/>
you basically have to completely destroy the environment where they're found .
<Sync time="160.010"/>
all of the sediment is removed
<Sync time="162.135"/>
and processed in order to extract the oil .
<Sync time="164.850"/>
compare the way that we drill for oil in the gulf of mexico , where a small pipe is driven through the ground
<Sync time="169.940"/>
but ultimately ,
<Sync time="171.035"/>
very little damage is done .
<Sync time="173.010"/>
now the other side's going to talk about
<Sync time="174.450"/>
oil spills i'm sure .
<Sync time="175.850"/>
but ultimately the harms of the b_p oil spill a few years ago
<Sync time="179.840"/>
are much less to the gulf of mexico
<Sync time="181.940"/>
than removing all the sediment from large parts of north dakota is
<Sync time="185.495"/>
to those ecosystems .
<Sync time="187.150"/>
so we tell you that this
<Sync time="188.305"/>
o- oil not only
<Sync time="189.240"/>
prolongs our dependence on fossil fuels , but also that its extraction
<Sync time="193.080"/>
is vastly more harmful than traditional forms of extraction
<Sync time="196.670"/>
that we see in places like kuwait .
<Sync time="198.925"/>
and our third and final point is just a response to
<Sync time="202.140"/>
tim's analysis about opec .
<Sync time="204.195"/>
we tell you that ultimately , the huge drop in oil prices globally
<Sync time="208.550"/>
has done more to harm
<Sync time="209.630"/>
ordinary people living in petroleum states
<Sync time="212.415"/>
than it's done to their governments .
<Sync time="214.380"/>
so even if you don't like
<Sync time="216.120"/>
uh venezuela or russia's governments , the people who really suffer here
<Sync time="220.380"/>
are
<Sync time="221.095"/>
the people not the government .
<Sync time="223.215"/>
and i know that russia's not part of opec , but they're probably the best example of this .
<Sync time="227.545"/>
uh the russian ruble has completely collapsed due to the
<Sync time="231.240"/>
devaluation of oil
<Sync time="232.625"/>
and as a result , the russian people
<Sync time="234.630"/>
have been put under a great deal of pressure as they've lost their savings ,
<Sync time="237.890"/>
while vladimir putin remains in power and popular and hasn't been affected at all .
<Sync time="242.340"/>
so we don't think that the united states becoming an oil exporter by using this energy
<Sync time="246.735"/>
has actually been a good thing
<Sync time="248.110"/>
globally speaking .
<Sync time="249.160"/>
it's only hurt innocent people
<Sync time="251.120"/>
in oil-producing countries .
<Sync time="253.090"/>
so for all these reasons , we should not further exploit unconventional oil .
<Sync time="257.100"/>
thank you .
