i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.175"/>
that we should ban anonymous posting .
<Sync time="5.900"/>
our first independent point is that this is largely unenforceable .
<Sync time="10.320"/>
a lot of what gov discusses regarding illegal materials , such as you know like pirated movies but it also like more pernicious things like child pornography ,
<Sync time="19.200"/>
are largely circulated on sites that are themselves illegal ,
<Sync time="22.800"/>
like the pirate bay .
<Sync time="24.030"/>
this is a problem then
<Sync time="25.820"/>
because it is very difficult to enforce a law like this
<Sync time="29.430"/>
on a site that itself is already in violation of the law by virtue of its own existence .
<Sync time="35.480"/>
so we don't think that these sites are going to comply .
<Sync time="38.365"/>
but even with regards to
<Sync time="40.095"/>
other sites , like facebook and
<Sync time="42.195"/>
you know
<Sync time="42.890"/>
like they talk about 4chan for example ,
<Sync time="45.850"/>
i think there is one ,
<Sync time="47.360"/>
the problem of international enforcement
<Sync time="49.475"/>
that is that these sites exist across state borders so it will be
<Sync time="52.960"/>
extremely difficult for individual governments to make these requirements .
<Sync time="57.540"/>
but secondly , that these requirements
<Sync time="60.110"/>
even
<Sync time="60.805"/>
once successfully enforced are easy to evade .
<Sync time="64.020"/>
the best version of the model that gov puts forward
<Sync time="66.700"/>
is tying it to a facebook account .
<Sync time="68.680"/>
but facebook accounts can also be anonymous
<Sync time="72.410"/>
because you can just make like a facebook account with like a name and a photo that's not of you .
<Sync time="77.700"/>
so then this itself is a problem
<Sync time="79.815"/>
because it means that there's no actual way to insure that every single person has like
<Sync time="84.820"/>
their identity tied to them .
<Sync time="86.495"/>
the only way that you can really do you this is just to like automatically dox everybody by like
<Sync time="92.205"/>
tying each like account to the i_p address that it uses .
<Sync time="96.740"/>
obviously this is a huge rights violation for reasons i'll get into later
<Sync time="101.260"/>
but also with regards to the doxing argumentation put forward by gov like this would just be a ridiculously awful thing to do to people .
<Sync time="109.230"/>
our second independent point is free speech .
<Sync time="111.960"/>
so
<Sync time="112.485"/>
this is specifically why we think that there is a proactive right to be anonymous on the internet .
<Sync time="117.780"/>
we think that often people need to maintain anonymity from ,
<Sync time="121.240"/>
a ,
<Sync time="121.810"/>
fear of retaliation against 
<Sync time="124.190"/>
{ipinions/opinions} that are expressed . for example ,
<Sync time="126.790"/>
opposition viewpoints on a thread that is like largely in favor of one particular position
<Sync time="132.380"/>
require individuals to be anonymous out of fear of like direct physical offline retaliation .
<Sync time="138.725"/>
if i were to pro-
<Sync time="139.950"/>
post like for example a
<Sync time="141.445"/>
pro-hillary post on like r slash the donald ,
<Sync time="145.085"/>
it probably wouldn't go over too well
<Sync time="147.160"/>
and anonymity is necessary then for me to comfortably express myself in that forum .
<Sync time="152.530"/>
but secondly we think that there is a
<Sync time="154.620"/>
like fundamental right to remain anonymous
<Sync time="157.860"/>
on the basis that we think that
<Sync time="159.405"/>
opinion should just be expressed regardless of uh
<Sync time="163.075"/>
you know like we don't think that you need to tie your name to something to be
<Sync time="166.995"/>
to be capable of expressing an opinion .
<Sync time="169.315"/>
the reason that we w- care about free speech is simply because it's facilitative to other rights .
<Sync time="174.270"/>
you need to put your opinions out there so that governments and the public are aware that there is support for a specific ideology and can respond appropriately .
<Sync time="182.040"/>
this is especially true with governments .
<Sync time="184.070"/>
so we don't think then that it's necessary to tie that opinion
<Sync time="187.240"/>
to a specific person to exercise that right .
<Sync time="190.470"/>
rather this is something that can very easily exist in the abstract and we think that principally we should maintain people's capacity to represent those opinions
<Sync time="199.430"/>
anonymously .
<Sync time="201.010"/>
our third independent point in b- just briefly but the way in we think that because this is a fundamental right this outweighs like the discursive arguments that gov makes like
<Sync time="209.210"/>
these are very much like a like the discourse stuff is very much a drop in the bucket when compared to something like a fundamental right to free speech .
<Sync time="216.250"/>
our third independent point is the right to be forgotten .
<Sync time="219.580"/>
so we think that because
<Sync time="221.370"/>
a person is defined by their preferences and their opinions
<Sync time="225.040"/>
that like this fundamentally is what makes me distinct from other people ,
<Sync time="228.860"/>
your past self can be considered fundamentally distinct from your present self .
<Sync time="232.940"/>
your preferences and the basics thoughts and ideas that make up who you are change over time .
<Sync time="238.060"/>
so we think then that it is unfair for someone's past actions
<Sync time="241.600"/>
to fundamentally determine the current perceptions of them .
<Sync time="245.100"/>
given that , we think that anonymity is important because it preserves people's right to be forgotten .
<Sync time="250.280"/>
that is that their present self doesn't have to suffer for the
<Sync time="253.410"/>
actions taken by their past self .
<Sync time="255.790"/>
even from a perspective that doesn't make these into distinct individuals we still think it is
<Sync time="260.065"/>
fundamentally unjust the way that the internet has a tendency to like stir up people's pasts and use it against them .
<Sync time="266.600"/>
that fundamentally then can be protected by anonymity . proud to oppose .
