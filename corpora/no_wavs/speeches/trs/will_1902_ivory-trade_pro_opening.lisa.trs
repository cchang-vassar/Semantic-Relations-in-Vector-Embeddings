i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should legalize the ivory trade .
<Sync time="5.160"/>
the model is simple .
<Sync time="6.630"/>
um we will allow stockpiles only to be sold that is confiscated ivory by countries in which the ivory trade is obviously you know
<Sync time="15.220"/>
um fairly prevalent .
<Sync time="17.020"/>
so for example kenya , in the central african republic , have large stockpiles of ivory
<Sync time="22.320"/>
we will allow them to sell those stockpiles
<Sync time="25.275"/>
but we are not going to legalize a ,
<Sync time="27.860"/>
sale by non-government
<Sync time="29.270"/>
actors or b , the actual process of getting ivory from animals in the first place .
<Sync time="35.640"/>
three independent points . first ,
<Sync time="37.730"/>
this generates income for poor nations .
<Sync time="40.595"/>
most of the nations that are on the front lines of battling the ivory trade
<Sync time="45.060"/>
are disproportionately poor african nations .
<Sync time="48.480"/>
these are weak states that often have difficulty collecting reliable tax revenue
<Sync time="53.140"/>
and as such
<Sync time="53.940"/>
have a very small apparatus for actually responding to the front lines of the ivory trade .
<Sync time="60.130"/>
the problem we have with the ivory trade
<Sync time="62.525"/>
is that animals are harmed in the process and as such the most important link to sever
<Sync time="67.820"/>
is the link
<Sync time="68.890"/>
where in
<Sync time="69.540"/>
animal poachers actually extract ivory from rhinos and elephants .
<Sync time="74.570"/>
lacking the infrastructure to enforce anti-poaching laws
<Sync time="78.820"/>
means that these poor states are often left unequipped to do the most important job of stopping this problematic trade .
<Sync time="86.010"/>
if you allow them however to sell off this ivory
<Sync time="89.240"/>
and generate income that way ,
<Sync time="91.540"/>
then they're able to redirect those funds
<Sync time="93.755"/>
into actually
<Sync time="95.035"/>
uh like stamping down on the poaching itself . that is the most problematic aspect of the trade .
<Sync time="101.840"/>
our second independent point is that this policy
<Sync time="104.370"/>
undercuts the black market .
<Sync time="106.160"/>
countries can sell at a low selling point that is significantly lower than the market already solves for . so if a certain amount of ivory is worth a hundred dollars on the black market ,
<Sync time="116.110"/>
a state actor can undercut them
<Sync time="117.965"/>
for a lower amount of money say ,
<Sync time="119.765"/>
ninety dollars for that same amount
<Sync time="122.010"/>
and as such
<Sync time="123.020"/>
get a larger amount of interested buyers
<Sync time="125.935"/>
and cut out the black market from a significant portion of their sales .
<Sync time="130.110"/>
this in turn
<Sync time="131.205"/>
means that those who actually do the poaching
<Sync time="133.980"/>
are crowded out of the market .
<Sync time="135.640"/>
smugglers are likely to leave the profession
<Sync time="138.330"/>
as are poachers once they have no smugglers to sell to .
<Sync time="141.815"/>
this in turn ensures that
<Sync time="144.065"/>
as you engage in this policy
<Sync time="146.080"/>
you can
<Sync time="146.665"/>
essentially crowd out the market from its own industry
<Sync time="150.270"/>
and in essence
<Sync time="151.590"/>
kill the demand for actually hunting down these animals in the first place .
<Sync time="156.280"/>
our third independent point and probably most fundamental ,
<Sync time="160.380"/>
is that it reduces the demand for
<Sync time="163.085"/>
ivory .
<Sync time="163.955"/>
the reason why this is true
<Sync time="165.575"/>
is that you can target sales to lower class individuals .
<Sync time="169.830"/>
most of the demand for ivory right now
<Sync time="172.800"/>
is driven by a burgeoning chinese middle class
<Sync time="175.950"/>
that sees ivory as a status symbol .
<Sync time="178.440"/>
this in turn
<Sync time="179.650"/>
drives the incredible amount that is brought into
<Sync time="183.125"/>
uh china . i think like forty percent or possibly even sixty percent
<Sync time="187.375"/>
of the global ivory trade
<Sync time="189.190"/>
ends in china .
<Sync time="190.640"/>
so
<Sync time="191.140"/>
at that point then ,
<Sync time="192.405"/>
if you are able to target sales of ivory to lower income individuals
<Sync time="196.770"/>
and proliferate
<Sync time="197.760"/>
ownership of ivory among the lower class ,
<Sync time="200.720"/>
you kill the status of ivory
<Sync time="203.190"/>
as a status symbol .
<Sync time="205.340"/>
in essence , what this does is ensure that there isn't as much demand for ivory in the first place
<Sync time="211.650"/>
because if the middle class doesn't want it then the trend
<Sync time="214.030"/>
dies
<Sync time="214.655"/>
and over time the lower class is less interested in it as well .
<Sync time="218.270"/>
that intern ensures
<Sync time="219.720"/>
that there's nobody buying it from the smugglers , who in turn will not buy it from the poachers ,
<Sync time="224.345"/>
who in turn will move to other industries in order to ensure
<Sync time="228.460"/>
that they are you know making money because ivory doesn't have that money anymore .
<Sync time="233.480"/>
as such , a government actor is uniquely positioned
<Sync time="236.750"/>
to restructure the market
<Sync time="238.530"/>
to collapse the market . proud to propose .
<Sync time="242.199"/>
