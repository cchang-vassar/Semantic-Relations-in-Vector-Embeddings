<Sync time="2.075"/>
i'm proud to stand in proposition for today's motion
<Sync time="4.930"/>
that cannabis should be legalized .
<Sync time="7.130"/>
three independent points : first ,
<Sync time="9.115"/>
that it is a paternalistic policy to ban people from engaging in consensual actions ,
<Sync time="14.210"/>
second ,
<Sync time="14.870"/>
that legalization will decrease the power and the harms of black markets ,
<Sync time="19.070"/>
and third , that implementation in the status quo
<Sync time="22.020"/>
has racist undertones .
<Sync time="24.030"/>
first on paternalism .
<Sync time="25.670"/>
it's important to recognize that , autonomy is a good in and of itself , that it is the fundamental right that we derive all others from .
<Sync time="31.730"/>
the reason that we care about , for example , our right to life , is because we have the ability to do things with that life ,
<Sync time="37.880"/>
so , going off of that ,
<Sync time="39.450"/>
them ,
<Sync time="39.800"/>
it's important that the baseline , that we attribute all policies by , is :
<Sync time="44.130"/>
does this allow people to do things , right ?
<Sync time="46.960"/>
the reason we don't like murder , or stealing , or things like that , is because it limits other people's ability to act within
<Sync time="53.680"/>
a way that actually makes their individual lives better .
<Sync time="56.765"/>
so , it's important then that , when there's not
<Sync time="59.210"/>
externalities ,
<Sync time="60.270"/>
we allow people to just make decisions for themselves , that they can consent into harm at they- so %hes .
<Sync time="66.145"/>
so it's important to recognize then , that if op gets up here and it says
<Sync time="69.455"/>
that
<Sync time="70.045"/>
this is a harmful drug , or it is something that
<Sync time="72.440"/>
creates harm to the individual ,
<Sync time="74.165"/>
that's not enough of a reason for you to vote for op .
<Sync time="76.570"/>
it's important to recognize that , the person has the right to engage in that action .
<Sync time="81.070"/>
my second independent point
<Sync time="82.620"/>
is that block markets , in the status quo , are extremely harmful .
<Sync time="86.380"/>
so , these exist already ,
<Sync time="88.050"/>
right ? things like
<Sync time="88.990"/>
cartels in mexico , things like
<Sync time="90.915"/>
even just street dealers in some suburb ,
<Sync time="93.630"/>
exist already ,
<Sync time="94.815"/>
and we crowd those out by legalization , because people prefer to buy in a market that has less risk .
<Sync time="100.390"/>
you're less likely to be caught up in gang violence , you are less likely to be
<Sync time="104.615"/>
cheated out of your product , because there's no regulatory body to oversee the person engaging in a transaction with you .
<Sync time="109.880"/>
people prefer to operate in the legal market , if it's an option .
<Sync time="113.080"/>
so , what are the harms then , of the black market , that we get rid of by legalization ?
<Sync time="117.180"/>
three independent : first ,
<Sync time="118.890"/>
cartels ,
<Sync time="119.740"/>
in and of themselves , create lots of violence .
<Sync time="122.340"/>
when you have a black market , it is easy for powerful actors to grab up large shares of market , creating effective monopolies ,
<Sync time="128.645"/>
that they protect those monopolies
<Sync time="130.600"/>
by use of violence .
<Sync time="132.160"/>
this leads to huge amounts of death ,
<Sync time="134.380"/>
it leads to mass amount of suffering .
<Sync time="136.500"/>
second is safety regulations .
<Sync time="138.800"/>
it's important to note that like ,
<Sync time="140.925"/>
when you have a black market ,
<Sync time="142.820"/>
there's no one able to come into a production plant , and say
<Sync time="145.810"/>
you're not up to code ,
<Sync time="147.180"/>
you're selling a product that is going to be harmful to people .
<Sync time="150.465"/>
we should always prefer a world , where you have that regulatory capacity to step in ,
<Sync time="154.995"/>
and say : this is an unsafe product , you are creating harm onto people by giving that product to them .
<Sync time="160.730"/>
third is access to children .
<Sync time="162.210"/>
it's a lot easier for people
<Sync time="163.970"/>
that are probably not developmentally ready to
<Sync time="166.600"/>
consume this item , like the people that are most likely to be harmed by it ,
<Sync time="170.370"/>
and the people that have the least information available then to meaningfully consent into it ,
<Sync time="175.280"/>
are most likely going to be reached by the black market .
<Sync time="178.020"/>
the reason why this is true is that , it's easy to crack down on the individual sellers , that are
<Sync time="183.155"/>
going around uh age
<Sync time="185.650"/>
age of sale laws like , for example , with alcohol ,
<Sync time="188.520"/>
be- when you actually have a legal system , that can be regulated . when this is not the case with a black market ,
<Sync time="193.910"/>
it's- this is why it's , like ,
<Sync time="195.570"/>
easier for kids to get pot than it is for them to get
<Sync time="198.355"/>
alcohol .
<Sync time="199.420"/>
so , the people , that are most vulnerable then , are more likely to be subjected to harm , in a world where the black market rules .
<Sync time="206.410"/>
my third independent point is racism ,
<Sync time="208.170"/>
and how specifically
<Sync time="209.645"/>
the
<Sync time="210.080"/>
implementation of the current law
<Sync time="212.120"/>
is- uses a tool of oppression
<Sync time="213.750"/>
primarily against african american communities .
<Sync time="216.080"/>
is important to recognize that , this isn't a law that's applied equally .
<Sync time="219.065"/>
this is a law that is
<Sync time="220.330"/>
generally used to put large amounts of black men into prison , 
<Sync time="223.680"/>
and largely used as an excuse for other things .
<Sync time="226.610"/>
things , like possession of small amounts of marijuana ,
<Sync time="229.120"/>
can become a front for engaging in a crime-
<Sync time="232.010"/>
for-
<Sync time="232.450"/>
as a means of arresting someone for
<Sync time="234.600"/>
something fairly unrelated , something like a traffic stop .
<Sync time="238.060"/>
people will-
<Sync time="238.835"/>
cops will , like , search cars for drugs , in order to justify the arrest , things like that .
<Sync time="243.360"/>
so , it's important to get rid of this tool that is used to put down black males in the status quo ,
<Sync time="247.905"/>
and open up , like , our laws in a way that is much more reasonable . proud to propose .
<Sync time="252.100"/>
