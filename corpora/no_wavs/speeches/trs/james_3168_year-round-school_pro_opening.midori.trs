we should introduce year round schooling .
<Sync time="3.710"/>
right now , in the united states at least ,
<Sync time="6.130"/>
primary and secondary school students tend to have a large break in the summertime
<Sync time="10.755"/>
when traditionally you would have had lots of work on the farm for them to do .
<Sync time="14.855"/>

<Sync time="15.440"/>
most american students currently go to school for about thirty six weeks in the year .
<Sync time="19.900"/>
we propose a system wherein students go to school for twelve weeks with one week break afterwards
<Sync time="25.210"/>
which would have them go to school for forty eight weeks in the year .
<Sync time="28.100"/>
three arguments for why this is better than what we have right now .
<Sync time="31.680"/>
the first is that this would better facilitate student's learning .
<Sync time="35.900"/>
during summer vacation students forget much of what they learned in the previous year .
<Sync time="41.100"/>
this is harmful for a few reasons .
<Sync time="43.300"/>
first of all , we tell you that students lose time at the beginning of the new school year reviewing material which they already have learned .
<Sync time="50.370"/>
if students go home for the summer and forget
<Sync time="52.830"/>
the names of the elements or great british authors or whatever they learned the previous year ,
<Sync time="57.610"/>
and they have to relearn them in the fall , then this is time that isn't spent
<Sync time="61.285"/>
learning new material .
<Sync time="63.020"/>
on top of that we tell you that this facilitates learning because students are spending more time in the classroom .
<Sync time="69.580"/>
the only way for students to learn material is to be exposed to it in the first place .
<Sync time="73.940"/>
we tell you that by having forty eight weeks
<Sync time="75.920"/>
as opposed to thirty six of time with teachers
<Sync time="78.570"/>
the students will simply learn more material .
<Sync time="81.650"/>
it doesn't matter if you want students to learn more stem ,
<Sync time="84.355"/>
or to be better informed citizens ,
<Sync time="86.600"/>
no matter what you think
<Sync time="87.760"/>
education should be doing for students , it can be done better
<Sync time="90.930"/>
with more time with teachers , with more time to learn .
<Sync time="93.925"/>
and i'd also like to point out that particularly for low income students it's likely that they aren't using their time
<Sync time="99.755"/>
during the summer to better educate themselves .
<Sync time="102.360"/>
they might be working
<Sync time="103.440"/>
or they might just be in child care
<Sync time="105.200"/>
not really doing anything productive .
<Sync time="107.330"/>
so if students are in school year round it's likely that they are reading
<Sync time="110.785"/>
and doing experiments and other useful activities during the summer
<Sync time="114.510"/>
instead of playing with water guns with their friends which ,
<Sync time="117.590"/>
while gratifying , probably doesn't do a great deal
<Sync time="120.400"/>
to prepare them for the work force or for college .
<Sync time="123.360"/>
our second argument is about how this helps parents .
<Sync time="126.705"/>
consider that if your children have a twelve week break in the summer you have to arrange childcare for that time .
<Sync time="133.490"/>
whereas when your children are in school ,
<Sync time="135.390"/>
they are in a safe ,
<Sync time="136.640"/>
productive environment for free .
<Sync time="138.730"/>
during the summer you have to pay someone to look after your children if you work .
<Sync time="142.540"/>
we think that this places an undue burden on low income parents in particular .
<Sync time="147.820"/>
in other words , the families that can least afford to bear the cost of additional childcare
<Sync time="152.295"/>
are likely to be the ones in which both parents work .
<Sync time="155.340"/>
so not only are these families now being forced to pay for childcare , but this is a burden that accrues disproportionately
<Sync time="161.160"/>
to those worst off in society .
<Sync time="163.220"/>
we think that it would be far better to provide free childcare for those people .
<Sync time="167.215"/>
at that point when we already have their children , probably in a school being supervised ,
<Sync time="171.910"/>
we might as well be teaching them .
<Sync time="173.645"/>
moreover we think that these parents also
<Sync time="176.450"/>
are going to have their children
<Sync time="178.030"/>
on a system more like their own work schedule if their children go to school throughout the year .
<Sync time="182.460"/>
parents can choose to take time off of work when their children have their short breaks
<Sync time="186.670"/>
which allows them to spend more quality time with their children .
<Sync time="189.660"/>
we tell you that at the end of the day this is better than having the children home for the summer
<Sync time="193.220"/>
without lots of time spent with their parents .
<Sync time="195.940"/>

<Sync time="196.810"/>
our last argument is that this would lead to a better use of resources .
<Sync time="200.520"/>
consider that if children are
<Sync time="202.470"/>
at home during the summer , then schools are presumably sitting empty .
<Sync time="205.940"/>
we think that this is a waste of the resources that we've invested in those schools ,
<Sync time="209.630"/>
not to use them year round .
<Sync time="211.430"/>
if we have to give them power and air and things like that ,
<Sync time="214.450"/>
we might as well have children in them learning at the same time .
<Sync time="218.030"/>
and lastly we tell you that this is a misuse of teacher's time .
<Sync time="221.290"/>
that ultimately we would be better off having teachers spend more time teaching
<Sync time="225.085"/>
and less time working on other projects during the summer .
<Sync time="227.990"/>
while no doubt these are of value to the individual teachers , we think that
<Sync time="231.695"/>
having more face to face time with children would ultimately
<Sync time="234.705"/>
allow teachers to do their job more effectively 
<Sync time="237.280"/>
and place less of a burden on them during that thirty six week period
<Sync time="240.590"/>
that they had before .
<Sync time="242.280"/>
for all these reasons we should introduce year round schooling .
<Sync time="245.080"/>
thank you .
