we don't think that rejecting multiculturalism means rejecting
<Sync time="4.330"/>
all cultural differences between individuals .
<Sync time="7.720"/>
rather , we think that rejecting multiculturalism
<Sync time="10.360"/>
has to do with the way that we approach
<Sync time="12.260"/>
the macro expression of culture within a country .
<Sync time="15.430"/>
so it's the difference between saying that
<Sync time="18.160"/>
this country does not have a single culture
<Sync time="20.915"/>
but rather is made up of multiple groups and multiple different cultures ,
<Sync time="24.990"/>
versus saying that
<Sync time="26.200"/>
even though we might have people who are from different countries who have different cultural expressions ,
<Sync time="31.210"/>
we as the united states ,
<Sync time="33.100"/>
or we as australia or any country have one main culture that we identify as that ties us all together .
<Sync time="40.270"/>
we think that you're always going to have
<Sync time="42.465"/>
people who are
<Sync time="43.615"/>
like culturally diverse .
<Sync time="45.170"/>
it's about what you look at on the macro scale
<Sync time="48.050"/>
when we talk about multiculturalism or not .
<Sync time="51.070"/>
with that , two main areas of clash .
<Sync time="53.030"/>
the first on decreasing violence within your culture .
<Sync time="56.270"/>
because clashes and tensions are going to exist between cultures on both sides of the house ,
<Sync time="61.545"/>
but it is worse when those groups are kept distinct
<Sync time="64.660"/>
and are told that they are different , are told
<Sync time="67.035"/>
to revel in that differentness and
<Sync time="68.930"/>
maintain that culture ,
<Sync time="70.895"/>

<Sync time="71.550"/>
rather than feeling like they have to assimilate .
<Sync time="74.060"/>
because
<Sync time="74.725"/>
rather than feeling like they are part of a greater whole , part of that country first ,
<Sync time="79.560"/>
these groups instead
<Sync time="80.690"/>
feel alienated from other cultures and this creates more rise in tensions because there is no over arching identity that binds them together ,
<Sync time="89.170"/>
but also makes it easier for a more dominant culture
<Sync time="92.160"/>
to destroy subcultures or
<Sync time="93.780"/>
force them into sub par living conditions .
<Sync time="96.080"/>
because there's less pr- there's less pressure
<Sync time="98.970"/>
to assimilate less pressure to be accepting
<Sync time="101.325"/>
when
<Sync time="101.900"/>
your country is when your country feels
<Sync time="104.505"/>
that
<Sync time="105.335"/>
%hes that there is no like main identity
<Sync time="108.675"/>
and rather multiple different ones . so we think
<Sync time="111.030"/>
like is- in situations where you have
<Sync time="113.305"/>
small minority groups
<Sync time="114.730"/>
living in
<Sync time="115.460"/>
largely , it like within the middle of a larger like
<Sync time="118.260"/>
um
<Sync time="118.600"/>
majority group ,
<Sync time="119.700"/>
in the situations of multiculturalism
<Sync time="122.160"/>
and acceptance of multiculturalism
<Sync time="124.170"/>
you're going to have much more tension between them
<Sync time="126.370"/>
because you don't actually have something that binds them together
<Sync time="129.260"/>
beyond
<Sync time="129.980"/>
just being individuals .
<Sync time="132.470"/>
so ,
<Sync time="132.920"/>
we think that individual tensions grow when there is no mainstream culture to connect them .
<Sync time="137.470"/>
so ,
<Sync time="137.910"/>
my russian jewish family
<Sync time="140.060"/>
is much more likely to be
<Sync time="141.985"/>
hostile towards
<Sync time="143.835"/>
the like
<Sync time="145.410"/>
polish christians
<Sync time="146.880"/>
across the hallway
<Sync time="148.070"/>
because
<Sync time="148.700"/>
we aren't actually feeling like we are all americans , but are rather identifying each other by our ethnicities
<Sync time="154.070"/>
and by the harms that our ethnic-
<Sync time="155.730"/>
ethnicities
<Sync time="156.550"/>
might have
<Sync time="157.080"/>
done to each other . so like " those pol's killed a lot of jews during the holocaust . "
<Sync time="161.870"/>
are second area of clash has to do with creating a strong national identity
<Sync time="165.390"/>
and its importance .
<Sync time="166.470"/>
because what drew misunderstands is that a melting pot means
<Sync time="169.675"/>
bringing in parts of other people's cultures
<Sync time="171.960"/>
into the mainstream and celebrating those components .
<Sync time="174.710"/>
because it's always going to be impossible to celebrate
<Sync time="177.525"/>
every single culture in its entirety ,
<Sync time="180.420"/>
so what we allow is for the mainstream and for the majority groups
<Sync time="183.970"/>
to
<Sync time="184.440"/>
experience minority culture and to bring it into the limelight
<Sync time="187.990"/>
while individual culture still exist .
<Sync time="191.140"/>
so on the comparative , we think that dividing people by ethnicity
<Sync time="194.550"/>
means they choose their ethnic group
<Sync time="196.490"/>
above their own nation .
<Sync time="197.810"/>
so i'm going to be
<Sync time="199.520"/>
a
<Sync time="200.050"/>
russian or a jew or
<Sync time="202.860"/>
a ,
<Sync time="203.580"/>
i don't know , israeli before i'm going to be
<Sync time="206.225"/>
an american , even though i currently live or have citizenship in america .
<Sync time="210.130"/>
we think this is both bad economically , because a lot of the time people make decisions off of
<Sync time="214.550"/>
what corporations to support
<Sync time="216.340"/>
based on the ethnicity
<Sync time="217.860"/>
rather than on the country . so my dad will buy
<Sync time="220.180"/>
an israeli product before he buys an american one ,
<Sync time="223.160"/>
just because he feel solidarity there .
<Sync time="225.465"/>
but it's also bad for
<Sync time="227.160"/>
the service like that we pay to our own countries . right ?
<Sync time="229.890"/>
so a lot of the time , if you're encouraging multi culturalism ,
<Sync time="232.850"/>
you're going to lose a lot of people who are returning to what they call the homeland ,
<Sync time="236.355"/>
and so you lose their productivity .
<Sync time="238.240"/>
or a really good example is when
<Sync time="240.105"/>
american jews go and serve in the israeli military rather than the american ones .
<Sync time="244.210"/>
we think this is something you have to accept
<Sync time="246.050"/>
when you're promoting multiculturalism . for these reasons , proud to
<Sync time="249.495"/>
oppose .
<Sync time="250.970"/>
