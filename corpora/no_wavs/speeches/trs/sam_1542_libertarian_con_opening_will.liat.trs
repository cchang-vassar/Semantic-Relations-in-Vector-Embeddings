i stand in
<Sync time="1.165"/>
firm opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.150"/>
we should adopt
<Sync time="4.060"/>
libertarianism .
<Sync time="6.130"/>
there are few political ideologies
<Sync time="8.450"/>
as fundamentally misconstrued and as fundamentally
<Sync time="12.510"/>
uh mischampioned as libertarianism .
<Sync time="15.445"/>
it is a system which favors the rich and the powerful .
<Sync time="18.715"/>

<Sync time="19.290"/>
although
<Sync time="20.290"/>
the adoption of libertarianism in many ways
<Sync time="23.680"/>
seems like the adoption of natural forms of power ,
<Sync time="27.120"/>
natural ways of thinking ,
<Sync time="28.515"/>
we would say that all that it does is create a vacuum ,
<Sync time="32.740"/>
where the presently rich and powerful
<Sync time="34.970"/>
can decide literally every rule that they want for themselves 
<Sync time="38.620"/>
with incredibly little government oversight .
<Sync time="41.010"/>

<Sync time="42.190"/>
one overview before three reasons why we should not adopt libertarianism .
<Sync time="47.140"/>
my overview is very simply
<Sync time="48.590"/>
that in any western liberal democracy
<Sync time="50.820"/>
where this kind of debate
<Sync time="51.980"/>
would ever be possible ,
<Sync time="53.960"/>
the alternatives are liberty and democracy .
<Sync time="57.490"/>

<Sync time="60.220"/>
without adopting libertarianism ,
<Sync time="62.880"/>
we can easily adopt a system where every individual gets a say in the government .
<Sync time="66.990"/>
where there's not profound amounts of gerrymandering
<Sync time="69.260"/>
or abuse ,
<Sync time="70.300"/>
and
<Sync time="71.435"/>

<Sync time="72.040"/>
where there is ample amounts of government intervention and regulation .
<Sync time="75.975"/>
in this speech i'm going to show why
<Sync time="78.565"/>
it is essential that we have the social benefits
<Sync time="80.610"/>
of government regulation and control ,
<Sync time="82.745"/>
that
<Sync time="83.675"/>
we need to solve
<Sync time="85.090"/>
{pro--foundly/profoundly} problematic collective action problems , and s-
<Sync time="88.020"/>
thirdly ,
<Sync time="88.780"/>
how the powerful can never regulate themselves .
<Sync time="91.250"/>
first off , on social benefits .
<Sync time="93.290"/>
the most
<Sync time="93.950"/>
obvious way in which libertarianism can exert itself in the united states ,
<Sync time="98.140"/>
or a variety of other western liberal governments ,
<Sync time="100.925"/>
is
<Sync time="101.500"/>
by the immediate removal of social benefits and taxes .
<Sync time="105.070"/>

<Sync time="105.590"/>
we would say things like welfare , unemployment , social security , are essential in the status q-
<Sync time="110.080"/>
quo for helping people survive .
<Sync time="112.410"/>
many people who have already retired
<Sync time="114.500"/>
could not buy food , housing ,
<Sync time="116.820"/>
any of the necessities ,
<Sync time="117.920"/>
if not for social security .
<Sync time="119.520"/>
but even if we only have this debate in the abstract 
<Sync time="122.260"/>
rather than having a debate about the specific people who would literally starve as a result of this policy , 
<Sync time="127.330"/>
we would say that
<Sync time="128.380"/>
every government
<Sync time="129.280"/>
has people at the lowest end of society 
<Sync time="132.130"/>
who due to
<Sync time="132.920"/>
genetic factors , due to historical factors ,
<Sync time="135.405"/>
have been pushed to the bottom and cannot afford the basic necessities .
<Sync time="139.440"/>
if the government refuses to provide them ,
<Sync time="141.100"/>
no one else will . we see that in the status quo ,
<Sync time="144.920"/>
there's already incredible difficulty getting private industry to actually invest in the poorest people in society .
<Sync time="150.900"/>
they typically do it because
<Sync time="152.235"/>
the capitalist incentive of having a tax benefit is also there , and because it's good for p_r .
<Sync time="156.920"/>
in a system where the government has signaled that social benefits and social welfare
<Sync time="161.115"/>
are not a key interest and that there is no benefits to corporations , we think that this would also fall .
<Sync time="166.420"/>
and at that point , the poorest individuals would have no ability
<Sync time="169.885"/>
to essentially feed themselves ,
<Sync time="171.510"/>
which is the greatest harm that c-
<Sync time="173.040"/>
can be actualized upon them due to government action .
<Sync time="175.655"/>

<Sync time="176.610"/>
now , the second argument is that this creates profound collective action problems . we think things like roads , we think
<Sync time="181.990"/>
uh essential emergency services 
<Sync time="184.435"/>
must be solved through collective action .
<Sync time="187.710"/>
the alternative is private individuals creating toll roads , decreasing the efficiency of entire societies ,
<Sync time="192.470"/>
creating police forces and fire services ,
<Sync time="195.180"/>
first , making it so they have total power
<Sync time="197.195"/>
to control individuals by literally refusing them lifesaving services ,
<Sync time="201.005"/>
and secondly ,
<Sync time="201.860"/>
by refusing the poor these services , making their lives even more difficult .
<Sync time="205.420"/>
even in the status quo , it is incredibly
<Sync time="207.450"/>
expensive to be poor .
<Sync time="209.110"/>
and at the point where g-
<Sync time="210.250"/>
uh powerful individuals can charge even more to poor families ,
<Sync time="213.350"/>
we think that
<Sync time="214.205"/>
%hes the system is fundamentally unjust .
<Sync time="217.360"/>
my third argument is the idea of regulation .
<Sync time="219.520"/>
you cannot trust individuals to police themselves .
<Sync time="222.250"/>
this has been seen throughout history ,
<Sync time="224.300"/>
most recently in the financial %hes
<Sync time="225.790"/>
sector with two thou- th- two thousand eight financial crisis ,
<Sync time="228.695"/>
and we think that
<Sync time="229.530"/>
adopting libertarianism is just giving the power
<Sync time="232.580"/>
uh
<Sync time="233.065"/>
to the individuals who must be policed overall .
<Sync time="236.000"/>
we think this leads to inevitable
<Sync time="237.645"/>
economic destruction such as th-
<Sync time="239.230"/>
in two thousand eight ,
<Sync time="240.370"/>
level of abuses by the powerful ,
<Sync time="242.235"/>
and a system which
<Sync time="243.320"/>
is essentially a vacuum where other powerful actors can take the reins
<Sync time="247.345"/>
to the
<Sync time="247.925"/>
harm of all society .
<Sync time="249.660"/>
for this reason , we should not adopt libertarianism .
<Sync time="253.669"/>
