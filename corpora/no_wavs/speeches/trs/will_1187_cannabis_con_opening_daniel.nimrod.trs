<Sync time="1.660"/>
i'm proud to stand in opposition of today's motion ,
<Sync time="4.425"/>
that we should legalize cannabis 
<Sync time="6.860"/>
for recreational purposes .
<Sync time="8.920"/>
so ,
<Sync time="9.545"/>
i think three- two independent arguments  , sorry .
<Sync time="12.440"/>
first 
<Sync time="13.020"/>
is that there are medical harms intrinsic to usage of recreational marijuana ,
<Sync time="17.520"/>
and that there's a significant government interest in combating the proliferation of those medical arms ,
<Sync time="22.660"/>
and secondly ,
<Sync time="23.645"/>
that it distorts the medical industry
<Sync time="25.970"/>
from a financial perspective ,
<Sync time="27.710"/>
that means that , people who need this medically , that is the people who
<Sync time="30.885"/>
for- for which you li-
<Sync time="32.120"/>
usage is most legitimate ,
<Sync time="33.885"/>
are the ones who disproportionately suffer under this policy .
<Sync time="37.125"/>
so on the first argument , that there are medical harms intrinsic to
<Sync time="40.870"/>
recreational use .
<Sync time="42.330"/>
i think this is- there's a couple of ways
<Sync time="43.970"/>
this plays out .
<Sync time="44.710"/>
so ,
<Sync time="45.320"/>
cognitive harms , for example , like there are tons of studies out there , that demonstrate that there's very
<Sync time="50.500"/>
damage in terms of
<Sync time="51.790"/>
long term memory , short term memory ,
<Sync time="54.470"/>
uh brain cell generation , all sorts of issues ,
<Sync time="57.430"/>
that are intrinsic to systemic- to repeated use .
<Sync time="60.830"/>
but secondly , that these harms are disproportionately internalized by children , that when you have a developing brain , this is something that is ,
<Sync time="68.460"/>
you know ,
<Sync time="68.870"/>
more likely to happen .
<Sync time="70.480"/>
uh so ,
<Sync time="71.645"/>
and also beyond this , there is like very little access to information regarding these harms , but i'll get into that in a moment .
<Sync time="78.090"/>
so ,
<Sync time="78.600"/>
why is the government justified , then , in restricting on this basis ?
<Sync time="82.510"/>
five reasons .
<Sync time="83.565"/>
first , you just decrease net suffering ,
<Sync time="85.700"/>
right ? like , if there is a medical harm , that is intrinsic to the usage of the item ,
<Sync time="89.580"/>
that less people suffer when less people use it . i think
<Sync time="92.400"/>
it is intuitively true , that the recreational market means more usage happens , because
<Sync time="96.700"/>
illegality
<Sync time="97.975"/>
is actually a barrier to purchasing ,
<Sync time="100.840"/>
like  when someone makes that calculus in deciding , am i going to smoke this or not ,
<Sync time="105.270"/>
am i going to go out and buy this or not ,
<Sync time="107.870"/>
generally speaking , it it's more likely that person will decide
<Sync time="111.200"/>
no ,
<Sync time="111.900"/>
if there is a risk of like arrest , or a fine , or something , if they do so .
<Sync time="115.740"/>
secondly , consent is not always meaningful into doing this . this is because there is like less
<Sync time="121.165"/>
imperfect
<Sync time="121.970"/>
access to information regarding the harms of the item .
<Sync time="125.090"/>
uh un- even under a legal structure , i think tobacco is a good example of this , where there is
<Sync time="129.895"/>
usually this like meaningful distortion of facts by the industry producing the good .
<Sync time="134.890"/>
third is that there are sometimes
<Sync time="136.360"/>
externalities to this usage , that are not just medical . so i think a good example of this is stoned driving , where
<Sync time="141.485"/>
people who didn't consent into the consumption of the item , people that are just innocent bystanders , have to internalize the harms that are intrinsic to the consumption of the item .
<Sync time="150.105"/>
forth is public health costs . so ,
<Sync time="152.175"/>
insurance is a good example of something that happens , right ? when this is a
<Sync time="155.740"/>
legal item ,
<Sync time="157.090"/>
insurance companies ,
<Sync time="158.480"/>
under you know ,
<Sync time="159.475"/>
things like pre existing condition laws , and like right to choose laws , and things like that ,
<Sync time="163.160"/>
cannot deny people coverage on the basis that they smoke pot .
<Sync time="166.250"/>
that's important , because it means that premiums go up , because there are more things that 
<Sync time="170.445"/>
insurance companies have to solve for ,
<Sync time="172.470"/>
when you have to internalize the harms that are created on the public health network ,
<Sync time="176.590"/>
by the people who are smoking pot , and disproportionately likely to have medical complications .
<Sync time="181.190"/>
society at large has to bear those burdens , because of the increased premiums , you have to get the money from somewhere .
<Sync time="186.880"/>
and fifth ,
<Sync time="188.440"/>

<Sync time="189.025"/>
is that it is a gateway drug .
<Sync time="191.160"/>
i think
<Sync time="191.820"/>
gov tries to preempt this , by being like : the black market has more gateway opportunities , because of the nature of the
<Sync time="196.950"/>
transaction .
<Sync time="198.090"/>
i think you can just
<Sync time="198.910"/>
weigh this out with the scope of consumption ,
<Sync time="201.880"/>
that more people smoke on their side of the
<Sync time="204.350"/>
house , as a result , you get more gateway activity on their side of the house .
<Sync time="208.710"/>
my second independent argument is that it distorts the medical industry ,
<Sync time="211.860"/>
because there's now a financial incentive to pump money into researching recreational strains of marijuana , because the payoff is bigger . i think is intuitively true , like
<Sync time="220.080"/>
there are generally going to be people that um
<Sync time="223.035"/>
like , generally , the market of people that would consume on a recreational basis is larger than the medical industry ,
<Sync time="228.330"/>
so there's a financial incentive to prioritize the recreational industry .
<Sync time="232.085"/>
that's a problem , because that research is zero sum .
<Sync time="234.805"/>
so , it's always going to come at the expense of the people that need it for medical purposes ,
<Sync time="238.740"/>
and we should always prioritize the people that need access to this uh
<Sync time="242.140"/>
substance the most ,
<Sync time="243.885"/>
at the highest rate . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="246.805"/>
