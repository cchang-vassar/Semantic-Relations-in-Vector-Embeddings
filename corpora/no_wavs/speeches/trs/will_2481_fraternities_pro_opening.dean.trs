i'm proud to support the motion that we should ban fraternities .
<Sync time="4.290"/>
three independent points . first is the
<Sync time="7.130"/>
culture of abuse that exists within
<Sync time="9.320"/>
frat life and greek life in general .
<Sync time="12.250"/>
we think that because fraternities are often hierarchies that are
<Sync time="16.215"/>
this that put students at the top that particularly put like adolescents that often don't have a good sense of
<Sync time="21.750"/>
uh you know
<Sync time="22.710"/>
control over how like a party might go or
<Sync time="25.375"/>
even have much experience and sort of managing this type of things ,
<Sync time="28.850"/>
things can often spiral out of control .
<Sync time="31.010"/>
it is difficult for a frat
<Sync time="32.530"/>
to say essentially you know we are going to draw a line in the sand during the party , this is something that is going on that we don't approve of
<Sync time="38.795"/>
something like under age drinking
<Sync time="40.430"/>
something like sexual assault .
<Sync time="42.130"/>
we think then the because frats don't have the institutional basis to actually intervene meaningfully in the situations they are ill equipped to supervise these types of scenarios .
<Sync time="51.610"/>
but what we specifically see is frats as
<Sync time="54.540"/>
being significantly worse at doing
<Sync time="57.180"/>
than just like your standard run of the mill
<Sync time="59.400"/>
party
<Sync time="60.195"/>
is the culture that surrounds greek life .
<Sync time="62.475"/>
we think that there is often an assumption that you know
<Sync time="65.420"/>
frats can just sort of have a no rules approach to things that
<Sync time="68.905"/>
it's all like this very hedonistic kind of mindset
<Sync time="71.920"/>
but the problem with that of course is that like
<Sync time="74.720"/>
when you take this mindset , when you take the mindset of being in a frat means having whatever you want ,
<Sync time="80.310"/>
that often enables very pernicious behavior .
<Sync time="83.040"/>
so things like sexual assaults are significantly more common at fraternity parties
<Sync time="87.560"/>
than other types of parties
<Sync time="89.160"/>
because they are being run by people who are operating under the assumption
<Sync time="92.905"/>
that
<Sync time="93.275"/>
anyone who is at the party is essentially
<Sync time="95.930"/>
subject to their will , that they are
<Sync time="97.560"/>
running the show and as a result are entitled to individual people who are present there .
<Sync time="102.640"/>
we think this is inherently problematic and we think that this is inseparable from the nature of fraternities
<Sync time="108.385"/>
and as a result justifies a ban .
<Sync time="110.230"/>
our second independent point though
<Sync time="112.550"/>
is that fraternities as institutions in general
<Sync time="115.710"/>
result in regressive networking .
<Sync time="117.940"/>
so what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="120.090"/>
a lot of what op is probably going to tell you is that fraternities are good
<Sync time="123.745"/>
because it provides networking opportunities to young professionals that
<Sync time="127.180"/>
people who are trying to meet
<Sync time="128.760"/>
individuals with similar interests like particularly in the business sector
<Sync time="132.350"/>
often use fraternities to establish those ties .
<Sync time="135.350"/>
but we think this is inherently an issue
<Sync time="137.520"/>
because fraternities
<Sync time="138.995"/>
%hes
<Sync time="139.420"/>
being the basis by which these networks are created
<Sync time="143.060"/>
being a symbol of like elite
<Sync time="145.070"/>
rigor in institutions
<Sync time="146.830"/>
inherently tilts that perception of
<Sync time="149.750"/>
this is a person who is in
<Sync time="151.450"/>
x organization thus has cre- credibility
<Sync time="154.190"/>
in favor of men .
<Sync time="155.780"/>
if this is something that fraternities uniquely access
<Sync time="158.745"/>
it becomes something that
<Sync time="159.945"/>
gives an advantage to men unjustly .
<Sync time="162.670"/>
we think that by banning fraternities and 
<Sync time="165.170"/>
by extension by banning these networks from being disproportionately tilted towards men
<Sync time="170.380"/>
we reduce the fundamental basis for inequity in the workplace that is that
<Sync time="174.655"/>
from the starting gate
<Sync time="176.140"/>
men often have networks that enable them to get into positions of higher authority and higher employment
<Sync time="181.900"/>
that women just don't have access to because of the tilted nature of greek life .
<Sync time="186.730"/>
our third and final independent point though is
<Sync time="189.955"/>
really to preempt something that we think op is going to say that is that
<Sync time="193.525"/>
by banning fraternities are just like push them off campus they're just going to do
<Sync time="197.750"/>
even worse things without university supervision .
<Sync time="200.860"/>
we think in general that argument is something that falls because universities don't do much to supervise them right now
<Sync time="207.760"/>
but more importantly
<Sync time="209.215"/>
is that we think that the ban on fraternities will send a valuable signal
<Sync time="213.575"/>
that is
<Sync time="214.185"/>
the university is specifically putting a stamp of disapproval on fraternities as an institution
<Sync time="219.970"/>
saying this is something with problematic ,
<Sync time="222.340"/>
this is something that is dangerous .
<Sync time="224.230"/>
we think that is
<Sync time="225.085"/>
a ,
<Sync time="225.680"/>
going to help a lot of students who aren't in fraternities particularly like
<Sync time="229.560"/>
incoming students
<Sync time="230.755"/>
say maybe this is something i shouldn't associate myself with
<Sync time="233.945"/>
maybe i shouldn't go to these parties because this is something that has been explicitly labeled as problematic and dangerous for me .
<Sync time="240.600"/>
but secondly we think it's useful because
<Sync time="243.135"/>
even if fraternities will continue to try to exist
<Sync time="245.900"/>
off campus ,
<Sync time="246.870"/>
we think that stamp of disapproval
<Sync time="248.940"/>
that societal signal from the university will be valuable in
<Sync time="253.360"/>
in the long run
<Sync time="254.540"/>
mitigating their influence . proud to
<Sync time="257.140"/>
propose .
<Sync time="258.366"/>
