obviously the legal system isn't perfect and is incapable of always delivering justice purely .
<Sync time="5.815"/>
it will never be able to do that .
<Sync time="7.690"/>
that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try and maximize the justice in pursuit of truth , but we have to understand that there is a very dangerous tradeoff here :
<Sync time="14.640"/>
that the more power , the more absolute power we grant the state in pursuing truth and justice ,
<Sync time="19.830"/>
the more chances
<Sync time="20.860"/>
of creating greater injustice .
<Sync time="23.180"/>
this is why the system is built in such a way that limits the power of the government and the state
<Sync time="27.855"/>
out of the understanding that this asymmetry in powers can create a distortion
<Sync time="31.860"/>
and allow people in positions of power to do almost everything they wish .
<Sync time="35.395"/>
this is why we don't allow
<Sync time="37.295"/>
evidence that were unlawfully obtained to be submitted in the court ,
<Sync time="41.090"/>
even if they might help us reveal the truth .
<Sync time="43.100"/>
this is also why we limit the ability of the state to put its citizens in double jeopardy .
<Sync time="48.245"/>
and yes , this means that in some cases we will not be able to catch bad guys ,
<Sync time="52.490"/>
but that's simply worth the risk .
<Sync time="54.610"/>
we need to say , though , that there are very few cases , in reality ,
<Sync time="58.240"/>
of
<Sync time="59.170"/>
guilty defendants that are able to beat the system and get fully acquitted .
<Sync time="63.150"/>
everyone can cite the names of o_j simpson or bill cosby , but it's exactly because
<Sync time="67.815"/>
these are such rare instances that they became so famous .
<Sync time="71.710"/>
how do i know this ? because the national conviction rate in criminal felonies is above
<Sync time="75.955"/>
ninety percent , well above it .
<Sync time="77.660"/>
this means that it's incredibly rare ,
<Sync time="79.760"/>
next to impossible , to avoid conviction
<Sync time="82.000"/>
once charges have been pressed against you . no matter how good your lawyer is ,
<Sync time="85.810"/>
chances are against the defendant .
<Sync time="87.970"/>
do we really think that ninety something percent of defendants are guilty people ?
<Sync time="91.640"/>
i doubt that .
<Sync time="92.690"/>
given this , it is
<Sync time="94.240"/>
really unclear to me what is this so pressing problem that side government sees in the status quo
<Sync time="98.785"/>
that would require such a drastic amendment
<Sync time="101.210"/>
to one of the core tenets of the constitution
<Sync time="103.320"/>
and would require
<Sync time="104.190"/>
granting more power to the already too powerful public
<Sync time="107.115"/>
prosecution .
<Sync time="108.160"/>
we hear that it does
<Sync time="109.290"/>
more harm to allow guilty
<Sync time="111.510"/>
men walk around free than to judge
<Sync time="114.720"/>
and tria-
<Sync time="115.780"/>
try
<Sync time="116.250"/>
innocent men
<Sync time="116.970"/>
twice .
<Sync time="117.540"/>
we disagree .
<Sync time="118.360"/>
we disagree , both because we really don't accept this assumption
<Sync time="121.885"/>
that if you are a-
<Sync time="122.840"/>
truly innocent , then it's likely that you'll be found so a second time
<Sync time="126.260"/>
because as rachel says , the system is flawed .
<Sync time="128.870"/>
it's far from being perfect in pursuing truth .
<Sync time="131.300"/>
so ,
<Sync time="131.985"/>
in the second time or third time or fourth time , at some point ,
<Sync time="135.650"/>
people break .
<Sync time="136.560"/>
they no longer have the time or the money or the
<Sync time="139.265"/>
strength
<Sync time="140.240"/>
to keep on fighting for their innocence ,
<Sync time="142.050"/>
and the state will always have much more stamina and resources to continue fighting .
<Sync time="146.570"/>
so , once the state sets its aim on convicting someone , they can simply never rest
<Sync time="151.035"/>
until they manage to do so .
<Sync time="152.990"/>
we also , though , we like
<Sync time="155.030"/>
regardless of whether you're innocent or not , we
<Sync time="157.380"/>
we still disagree with this claim .
<Sync time="159.790"/>
we think that it's truly morally unjust when a criminal walks around free
<Sync time="163.445"/>
if he was never caught and put on trial .
<Sync time="166.210"/>
but
<Sync time="166.670"/>
given that we have caught this man ,
<Sync time="168.670"/>
and we have tried him and we were simply unable to convict him for whatever reason ,
<Sync time="172.480"/>
then the system did all that it could .
<Sync time="174.475"/>
it doesn't mean that it's good that he now walks around in the street
<Sync time="177.560"/>
but this is not also not a violation of rights ,
<Sync time="180.220"/>
as rachel would have you believe .
<Sync time="182.240"/>
meanwhile , we say that
<Sync time="183.830"/>
putting people through the entire process of a
<Sync time="185.940"/>
criminal trial , where your name and your reputation are smeared , your career
<Sync time="190.005"/>
is over ,
<Sync time="190.920"/>
your family life , your social life gets hurt badly ,
<Sync time="194.340"/>
you were forced to spend a fortune and
<Sync time="195.960"/>
after winning , you would have to face all of this again ,
<Sync time="199.190"/>
in our opinion this is a grave injustice , and this is
<Sync time="202.390"/>
amoral , you know what ,
<Sync time="203.720"/>
even if you are guilty .
<Sync time="205.065"/>
and then rachel says
<Sync time="206.425"/>
that people will start losing trust in the system and will start breaking laws when they see that the system is unable to catch and lock up the bad guys .
<Sync time="213.550"/>
so the first answer here is this is the classic
<Sync time="216.335"/>
example of a slippery slope . we would love to hear one example
<Sync time="219.765"/>
in which chaos and crime hit the streets
<Sync time="222.280"/>
due to double jeopardy .
<Sync time="224.410"/>
people don't abandon so quickly the concept of the rule of law and just take matters in their own hands . i know that this is an argument that we sometimes like to say in debateland ,
<Sync time="232.940"/>
but it's simply untrue .
<Sync time="234.540"/>
the system is
<Sync time="235.805"/>
deeply ingrained in our consciousness . most people cannot
<Sync time="238.880"/>
imagine a world without a country or the
<Sync time="241.245"/>
courts or the rule of law .
<Sync time="243.110"/>
second answer here
<Sync time="244.225"/>
is that if anything can create as- a public panic is to see
<Sync time="248.400"/>
that the criminal system harasses people who were already found innocent once
<Sync time="252.490"/>
and retries them over and over . people can say to themselves , " jesus , this man's life
<Sync time="257.070"/>
is ruined now , and it could have just as easily been me . "
<Sync time="260.625"/>
if anything , that's the kind of thing that could turn people much more {weery/wary}
<Sync time="264.110"/>
and suspicious towards
<Sync time="265.400"/>
the authorities .
<Sync time="266.270"/>
so for all of these reasons , we are very proud to oppose .
<Sync time="269.119"/>
