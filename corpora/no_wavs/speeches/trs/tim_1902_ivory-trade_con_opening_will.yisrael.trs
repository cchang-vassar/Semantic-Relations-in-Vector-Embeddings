we should not legalize
<Sync time="2.210"/>
ivory trade .
<Sync time="3.040"/>
in this debate we're going to make two broad arguments that are uh
<Sync time="6.500"/>
strongly connected . the first is about animal rights and why we think that animal rights
<Sync time="10.900"/>
do exist and why they ought to exist .
<Sync time="13.030"/>
and the second
<Sync time="14.005"/>
second argument is about why
<Sync time="16.150"/>
legalizing the ivory trade would violate those rights would be an immoral act
<Sync time="20.210"/>
and it would expand harm
<Sync time="21.535"/>
to animals that should be protected .
<Sync time="23.855"/>
right so on animal rights
<Sync time="25.720"/>
we think that rights need to be based on some sort of objective standard
<Sync time="30.120"/>
in order to be prescriptive .
<Sync time="32.030"/>
what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="33.435"/>
if rights are something that you can just change based on
<Sync time="36.380"/>
your perspective or change based on your subjective preference
<Sync time="39.920"/>
than these rights don't have any strong binding power .
<Sync time="42.930"/>
in order for these rights to be binding they need to be based on something
<Sync time="46.255"/>
that's objective something that isn't based on person from one person to the next
<Sync time="50.250"/>
but something that remains constant throughout all actors
<Sync time="53.170"/>
that the rights apply to .
<Sync time="54.435"/>
the way that we do this in reality
<Sync time="56.725"/>
is by weighing pain versus pleasure .
<Sync time="59.055"/>
the way that we ascribe rights is we find something that
<Sync time="62.135"/>
provides an immense amount of
<Sync time="63.540"/>
pain to an individual or immense amount of pain to something
<Sync time="66.615"/>
and we
<Sync time="67.335"/>
make it so that there's a right that prevents that pain from being ascribed
<Sync time="71.440"/>
in that pain
<Sync time="72.640"/>
uh
<Sync time="73.085"/>
and because that pain would so totally outweigh any sort of pleasure that could come from it
<Sync time="77.110"/>
and so we should ascribe rights based on those who experienced pain and pleasure .
<Sync time="81.780"/>
this means that animals
<Sync time="83.200"/>
specifically
<Sync time="83.890"/>
elephants that the ivory is coming from
<Sync time="86.120"/>
should be covered under our system of rights .
<Sync time="88.920"/>
why is this the case . because if we choose a different standard
<Sync time="92.115"/>
then we're doing so arbitrarily so that we can exclude animals .
<Sync time="95.440"/>
when the fact of how we ascribe rights is based on this principle .
<Sync time="99.110"/>
this principle that we should minimize pain
<Sync time="101.260"/>
and maximize pleasure .
<Sync time="102.830"/>
those rights should be ascribed
<Sync time="104.300"/>
and prescribed onto all sentient
<Sync time="106.560"/>
beings that can feel pain and pleasure .
<Sync time="108.970"/>
ivory requires the hunting and maiming of elephants
<Sync time="111.690"/>
causing an immense amount of pain .
<Sync time="113.470"/>
we think the right to life is a basic right
<Sync time="115.630"/>
something that even if you don't believe that animals should have full rights this is a right that they should have
<Sync time="119.870"/>
and any distinction to work around this would be arbitrary .
<Sync time="123.270"/>
so let's talk about how this law
<Sync time="125.310"/>
expands harm to animals .
<Sync time="127.220"/>
legalizing the ivory trade
<Sync time="128.820"/>
inevitably leads to increased desire for it .
<Sync time="131.745"/>
ivory already has a precious reputation . there's already an immense black market that exists
<Sync time="136.740"/>
in regard to ivory .
<Sync time="138.110"/>
we think that if you make it legal you could you make it easier for people
<Sync time="141.440"/>
to sell it
<Sync time="142.470"/>
to put it out on the open market
<Sync time="144.535"/>
and to make a profit off of it
<Sync time="146.400"/>
they're also much more likely to go
<Sync time="148.215"/>
and become poachers or to hire poachers to get higher
<Sync time="151.040"/>
ivory for them
<Sync time="152.150"/>
or poachers are just going to spring up
<Sync time="154.090"/>
on their own . regardless
<Sync time="156.100"/>
we think that when you when you make it easier to sell when you make it
<Sync time="159.755"/>
much easier to find a market for consumers
<Sync time="162.700"/>
but make it much easier to distribute to the market
<Sync time="165.290"/>
when you make it much easier
<Sync time="166.750"/>
to have possession of ivory in the first place
<Sync time="169.530"/>
all things that are made it very difficult because of the ivory laws
<Sync time="173.405"/>
that exist in the status quo
<Sync time="174.910"/>
you make the market
<Sync time="175.950"/>
larger .
<Sync time="176.570"/>
more hunters and poachers go after these animals because business is just more lucrative .
<Sync time="180.990"/>
this is likely to lead to extinction of
<Sync time="182.880"/>
elephants .
<Sync time="183.570"/>
in the status quo elephants are already a breed that is in the endangered species list
<Sync time="187.740"/>
and elephants don't bear enough children every year they have
<Sync time="190.450"/>
long gestation periods and only bear one or two children
<Sync time="193.760"/>
at any given time
<Sync time="195.040"/>
this means that if you increase the hunting numbers of elephants
<Sync time="198.210"/>
you're very likely to get to a point
<Sync time="200.135"/>
where they become extinct because you simply cannot replace them in the environment
<Sync time="203.940"/>
quickly enough .
<Sync time="204.940"/>
we think this is clearly immoral .
<Sync time="206.630"/>
this law
<Sync time="207.310"/>
only considers human short term utility
<Sync time="209.780"/>
over the long term utility of elephants
<Sync time="211.925"/>
and because those elephants can feel pain and feel pleasure
<Sync time="215.010"/>
they deserve to have their rights respected . for these reasons
<Sync time="218.395"/>
we should not legalize ivory trade .
<Sync time="220.625"/>
