the biggest problem that gov has in this debate is that danny misunderstands what double jeopardy
<Sync time="5.360"/>
actually is .
<Sync time="6.560"/>
what the legal definition connotes
<Sync time="8.630"/>
is that it is the same crime ,
<Sync time="10.280"/>
with the same evidence , that a person is retried for .
<Sync time="13.480"/>
what this means is that his entire first independent point
<Sync time="16.660"/>
that talks about what happens when the new evidence appears ,
<Sync time="19.715"/>
when someone confesses , all of this falls through
<Sync time="22.840"/>
because with the addition of new evidence , with the addition of a confession ,
<Sync time="26.620"/>
the crime can be appealed
<Sync time="28.195"/>
and the case can be reopened .
<Sync time="29.890"/>
we think at the point that there are significant systems in place
<Sync time="32.760"/>
that allow for the appeals process , will allow for hi- s-
<Sync time="35.595"/>
for people to come out and confess to their crimes ,
<Sync time="38.140"/>
even after they have pled non-guilty and won ,
<Sync time="40.625"/>
means that double jeopardy exists as a protection for innocence
<Sync time="44.580"/>
against the overreach of the judicial system .
<Sync time="47.350"/>
we think that when it is most used
<Sync time="49.855"/>
is when
<Sync time="50.660"/>
is in attempts to layer punishments or wear someone who's innocent down ,
<Sync time="54.710"/>
and that is what we are talking about in this debate .
<Sync time="57.060"/>
we think that everything that danny talked about is completely irrelevant
<Sync time="60.130"/>
at the point that you can always appeal the situation when new evidence comes out .
<Sync time="63.850"/>
two main areas of clash : the first on the justice system
<Sync time="66.850"/>
and why we think preserving the finality of rulings
<Sync time="69.470"/>
is important .
<Sync time="70.540"/>
we think that the purpose of the justice system and trial by jury
<Sync time="73.460"/>
is to evaluate guilt and innocence
<Sync time="75.490"/>
based on the people ,
<Sync time="76.410"/>
based
<Sync time="77.170"/>
on how your peers
<Sync time="78.550"/>
see you .
<Sync time="79.285"/>
what this means is that whether you are guilty or innocent
<Sync time="82.230"/>
isn't just a fact claim ,
<Sync time="83.605"/>
but also depends on things like your situation
<Sync time="86.320"/>
and where you were at the time
<Sync time="87.920"/>
and
<Sync time="88.315"/>
small amounts of biases with how people perceive them .
<Sync time="91.510"/>
for example ,
<Sync time="92.650"/>
something that might be perceived as first-degree murder by some individuals
<Sync time="96.235"/>
can also be spun to look like something like
<Sync time="99.055"/>
self-defense
<Sync time="100.340"/>
for others .
<Sync time="101.175"/>
this is why we think that it's important that when we stand by a standard of trial by your peers ,
<Sync time="105.925"/>
you stand by it to the end .
<Sync time="107.795"/>
you don't just get to switch out the peers at the end
<Sync time="110.150"/>
and try the trial over and over again
<Sync time="112.310"/>
until you get what you want
<Sync time="113.850"/>
as your result .
<Sync time="114.830"/>
rather , the first time is important
<Sync time="117.360"/>
unless something changes ,
<Sync time="119.300"/>
because this is the standard our legal system has
<Sync time="121.690"/>
set .
<Sync time="122.280"/>
we also think this protects against things like court clog
<Sync time="125.165"/>
and providing closure .
<Sync time="126.365"/>
we think at the point that you could just
<Sync time="127.765"/>
retry every trial as many times as you want until you got a guilty verdict ,
<Sync time="132.460"/>
you'd never stop retrying people .
<Sync time="134.340"/>
danny says , " oh , but we wouldn't want to do this " , 
<Sync time="136.975"/>
but i think he misunderstands the incentives
<Sync time="139.385"/>
of the j- judicial system ,
<Sync time="140.720"/>
elected judges ,
<Sync time="141.810"/>
people who work for the d_a's office . they want convictions , and they want
<Sync time="145.940"/>
and
<Sync time="146.850"/>
they bu- they oftentimes go to many ends to get them .
<Sync time="149.890"/>
we think that
<Sync time="150.420"/>
people who have money and have been victimized by others
<Sync time="153.170"/>
are often willing to spend that money
<Sync time="155.150"/>
trying and retrying trials because they want closure .
<Sync time="158.070"/>
all of these kinds of things are all reasons as to why
<Sync time="161.045"/>
you would go on and retry people and keep them in jail .
<Sync time="164.160"/>
but more than this , we think that providing closure for victims ,
<Sync time="166.960"/>
as well as perpetrators , is incredibly important .
<Sync time="169.570"/>
we think that after that
<Sync time="171.365"/>
hearing that your trial is being retried
<Sync time="173.750"/>
all over again
<Sync time="174.840"/>
is an extra level of emotional suffering that someone just shouldn't have to go through
<Sync time="178.925"/>
more than once .
<Sync time="180.055"/>
we think that when someone hears the guilty or not guilty verdict ,
<Sync time="183.520"/>
this should be the end
<Sync time="184.760"/>
insofar as
<Sync time="185.800"/>
anything after that is just additional suffering and additional pain .
<Sync time="189.710"/>
this works both for the victim ,
<Sync time="191.480"/>
insofar as now they have to listen
<Sync time="193.185"/>
and go through reliving that tri-
<Sync time="194.860"/>
reliving their damaged experiences over and over ,
<Sync time="197.800"/>
but also for the person who was accused ,
<Sync time="199.930"/>
insofar as they're if they are innocent ,
<Sync time="201.810"/>
they also have to live through this again .
<Sync time="204.040"/>
second , though , we want to talk about protection of the innocents ,
<Sync time="206.620"/>
because we think it's most important to keep those who are innocent
<Sync time="209.420"/>
out of jail
<Sync time="210.310"/>
insofar as imprisoning someone who's innocent
<Sync time="212.550"/>
is a rights violation on the part of the state ,
<Sync time="215.050"/>
and it's always worse than not imprisoning someone
<Sync time="217.855"/>
who is
<Sync time="218.420"/>
not innocent ,
<Sync time="219.440"/>
insofar as they have already committed their crime and no future rights violations are going to occur .
<Sync time="223.880"/>
we think that allowing the court to have systems that let them
<Sync time="227.150"/>
retry innocents over and over again in order to wear them down , because the d_a is so convinced that they are guilty
<Sync time="233.120"/>
that they will do anything regardless of the evidence ,
<Sync time="235.560"/>
is a problem , because a lot of the time the d_a or large corporations just have more money ,
<Sync time="240.725"/>
and in order to stop being dragged into that courtroom ,
<Sync time="243.010"/>
i will agree into anything .
<Sync time="244.920"/>
we also think that allowing courts to layer punishments
<Sync time="247.790"/>
is also a problem
<Sync time="249.100"/>
insofar as you can try someone for the same crime over and over again and give them more and more years in jail .
<Sync time="253.915"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="256.220"/>
