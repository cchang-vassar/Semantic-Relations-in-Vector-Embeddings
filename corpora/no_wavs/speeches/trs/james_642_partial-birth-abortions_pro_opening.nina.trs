we should ban
<Sync time="2.185"/>
partial birth abortions .
<Sync time="3.940"/>
so what this debate is about
<Sync time="4.600"/>
is abortions that are performed
<Sync time="6.840"/>
in the late second or in the third trimester
<Sync time="9.575"/>
of the pregnancy .
<Sync time="10.240"/>
in
<Sync time="10.880"/>
which the fetus is partially extracted ,
<Sync time="13.435"/>
and has its brain scooped out by a doctor
<Sync time="15.825"/>
and then the fetus
<Sync time="16.660"/>
is removed .
<Sync time="17.450"/>
so these abortions
<Sync time="18.680"/>
are 
<Sync time="19.080"/>
performed for many reasons .
<Sync time="20.340"/>
some might be performed at the mother's request ,
<Sync time="22.980"/>
others might be performed
<Sync time="24.160"/>
for the safety of the mother or because the fetus
<Sync time="26.680"/>
has already died ,
<Sync time="27.640"/>

<Sync time="27.730"/>
uh but we are opposed to this in any instance where it isn't
<Sync time="30.920"/>
medically required .
<Sync time="31.520"/>
so ,
<Sync time="33.080"/>
with that in mind we have two main arguments .
<Sync time="35.280"/>

<Sync time="35.410"/>
the first of which is that killing a fetus
<Sync time="37.760"/>
that is able to feel pain ,
<Sync time="39.290"/>
is ultimately
<Sync time="39.950"/>
wrong .
<Sync time="40.570"/>
we're not contending
<Sync time="41.750"/>

<Sync time="42.200"/>
that the fetus is the same as uh a baby that has already been
<Sync time="45.910"/>
born ,
<Sync time="46.210"/>
but what we are saying is that if you look at
<Sync time="48.545"/>
the net harm
<Sync time="49.595"/>
to the fetus versus the mother ,
<Sync time="51.760"/>
you're going to weigh
<Sync time="52.530"/>
down on the side of the fetus in every single instance .
<Sync time="54.940"/>
why is this true ?
<Sync time="56.230"/>

<Sync time="56.720"/>
let's consider the
<Sync time="57.990"/>
worse
<Sync time="58.020"/>
case where a mother has severe
<Sync time="60.330"/>
illness
<Sync time="61.165"/>
or mental health harms
<Sync time="62.760"/>
that are actually being
<Sync time="64.090"/>
suffered from her by the pregnancy .
<Sync time="65.370"/>

<Sync time="65.460"/>
we would be okay with this in those instances
<Sync time="67.510"/>
because
<Sync time="68.020"/>
there is a clear and present danger
<Sync time="69.360"/>
to
<Sync time="69.670"/>
the mother's life in the
<Sync time="69.789"/>

<Sync time="70.760"/>
form of mental illness .
<Sync time="71.790"/>
but at other times ,
<Sync time="73.190"/>
when a person
<Sync time="73.550"/>
may not want to bring a
<Sync time="74.810"/>
child to term , but
<Sync time="75.750"/>
isn't experiencing
<Sync time="76.900"/>

<Sync time="77.040"/>
this anguish or mental illness ,
<Sync time="78.110"/>

<Sync time="78.690"/>
we think that it's true that there is a certain
<Sync time="80.670"/>
amount of suffering and disutility going on ,
<Sync time="82.640"/>
but the loss of all future utility
<Sync time="84.870"/>
to that fetus ,
<Sync time="86.090"/>
compounded
<Sync time="87.180"/>
with
<Sync time="87.480"/>
the disutility of having
<Sync time="89.125"/>
%hes itself be killed by a doctor ,
<Sync time="91.470"/>
clearly you're always going to weigh
<Sync time="93.115"/>
those harms much more highly .
<Sync time="94.820"/>
we see that 
<Sync time="95.520"/>
for instance the anguish caused by this pregnancy ,
<Sync time="97.590"/>
is going
<Sync time="98.160"/>
to be temporary , whereas
<Sync time="99.530"/>
the harm
<Sync time="100.030"/>
of being dead ,
<Sync time="101.110"/>
ultimately weighs on forever .
<Sync time="102.730"/>

<Sync time="102.930"/>
but aside from that ,
<Sync time="104.050"/>
we see that although the fetus isn't a person
<Sync time="105.550"/>
right now , it's
<Sync time="106.620"/>
clearly has the potential to develop into one .
<Sync time="109.230"/>
many children are born prematurely 
<Sync time="111.810"/>
at an a- and survive
<Sync time="113.140"/>
at an age when this type of abortion would be performed .
<Sync time="115.610"/>
so it's clear that the fetus would be able to survive
<Sync time="117.680"/>

<Sync time="117.880"/>
and develop into
<Sync time="119.110"/>
a healthy human
<Sync time="120.030"/>
given the opportunity .
<Sync time="121.140"/>

<Sync time="121.270"/>
so at the end of the day we think that it is fundamentally
<Sync time="124.035"/>
unethical to kill a fetus that has the potential
<Sync time="126.920"/>

<Sync time="127.360"/>
to become
<Sync time="128.360"/>
a citizen in the future ,
<Sync time="129.670"/>
and that on top of that
<Sync time="131.500"/>
in your moral decision making ,
<Sync time="132.650"/>

<Sync time="132.680"/>
you want always consider more highly
<Sync time="135.555"/>
the person who served or
<Sync time="136.975"/>
being that serves to lose the most ,
<Sync time="138.830"/>
rather than the
<Sync time="139.050"/>
being that serves
<Sync time="140.025"/>
to have the most rights in the status quo .
<Sync time="142.300"/>

<Sync time="142.430"/>
this is why for instance ,
<Sync time="144.175"/>
even though animals obviously
<Sync time="145.550"/>
have
<Sync time="145.940"/>
lesser moral standing than humans ,
<Sync time="147.270"/>

<Sync time="147.620"/>
we still don't let people have
<Sync time="149.360"/>
cock fights , say .
<Sync time="150.500"/>
because although there might be utility for the people
<Sync time="153.165"/>
who
<Sync time="153.680"/>
uh practice that sport , the disutility to the roosters is much greater .
<Sync time="157.915"/>
now ,
<Sync time="158.535"/>
we're not trying to compare these mothers who want an abortion 
<Sync time="161.380"/>
to
<Sync time="161.420"/>
cock fighters ,
<Sync time="162.320"/>
but we do think that at the end of the day it would be unethical for the state
<Sync time="165.870"/>
not to consider what is best for the fetus given this tremendous amount of
<Sync time="169.580"/>
disutility
<Sync time="170.140"/>

<Sync time="170.610"/>
versus the utility to the
<Sync time="172.190"/>

<Sync time="172.210"/>
mother which , though not marginal , is still lesser .
<Sync time="174.480"/>

<Sync time="175.210"/>
our second argument is that we
<Sync time="176.820"/>
think that
<Sync time="177.200"/>
it is unjust or unethical for doctors to participate
<Sync time="180.445"/>
in these partial birth
<Sync time="181.490"/>
abortions .
<Sync time="182.160"/>
remember that when someone becomes
<Sync time="183.740"/>
a
<Sync time="184.110"/>
medical doctor , they swear the hippocratic oath ,
<Sync time="185.770"/>

<Sync time="186.280"/>
which basically states they will never do any intentional
<Sync time="189.070"/>
harm
<Sync time="189.330"/>
to a human being .
<Sync time="190.460"/>

<Sync time="190.820"/>
now ,
<Sync time="192.040"/>

<Sync time="192.120"/>
it's questionable at what point a fetus become
<Sync time="194.790"/>
a person ,
<Sync time="195.450"/>
but certainly they are a human being in the
<Sync time="198.230"/>
biological sense .
<Sync time="199.220"/>

<Sync time="199.270"/>
we think that 
<Sync time="200.270"/>

<Sync time="200.360"/>
doctors ought not be performing
<Sync time="202.115"/>
this late term abortion that involves killing a fetus therefore ,
<Sync time="205.050"/>

<Sync time="205.260"/>
because that fetus , one , is going to develop into a person ,
<Sync time="208.445"/>
and two , meets our standards for what a human is ,
<Sync time="210.120"/>

<Sync time="211.080"/>
namely , the ability to continue on
<Sync time="213.300"/>
as a human being , i suppose .
<Sync time="215.370"/>
but whatever standard you want to use ,
<Sync time="217.250"/>

<Sync time="217.270"/>
we think that doctors are
<Sync time="218.905"/>
violating one of the oaths that they took ,
<Sync time="221.195"/>
a very serious one moreover ,
<Sync time="222.740"/>

<Sync time="222.760"/>
when they perform
<Sync time="223.990"/>
this type of abortion .
<Sync time="225.180"/>
we think that the government should step
<Sync time="226.510"/>
in to prevent them from doing so .
<Sync time="228.110"/>
since the state takes responsibility for regulating doctors
<Sync time="231.420"/>
and for managing medical ethics ,
<Sync time="233.190"/>

<Sync time="233.230"/>

<Sync time="233.570"/>
so there's a clear precedent for government to intervene to prevent doctors from
<Sync time="237.455"/>
committing misdoi-
<Sync time="238.150"/>

<Sync time="238.340"/>
misdeeds and ultimately this would fall into that
<Sync time="241.050"/>
category .
<Sync time="241.470"/>
so for these two reasons , we should ban
<Sync time="243.470"/>
partial birth abortions . thank you .
