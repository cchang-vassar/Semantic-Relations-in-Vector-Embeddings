i'm proud to oppose the motion that we should ban human cloning .
<Sync time="4.310"/>
our first independent point is the spillover technology associated with human cloning .
<Sync time="9.710"/>
so we think that when you're talking about you know creating a new human um in a test tube or whatever lab environment you're looking at
<Sync time="16.975"/>
um
<Sync time="17.490"/>
there's a lot associated with that process that's important to
<Sync time="20.590"/>
understanding the human body at a very fundamental level 
<Sync time="24.050"/>
much in the way that research for things like say going to the moon
<Sync time="27.860"/>
don't necessarily have to have a
<Sync time="30.610"/>
you know intrinsic end point gain or value
<Sync time="33.420"/>
because the
<Sync time="34.475"/>
uh research that's conducted along the way often leads to benefits .
<Sync time="37.910"/>
we think that human cloning would have profound impacts on our medical understanding of the human body .
<Sync time="43.460"/>
we think that the ability to generate an entire human being
<Sync time="46.690"/>
would also yield technology relating to you know
<Sync time="49.580"/>
generation of limbs or other body parts that people might be missing .
<Sync time="53.800"/>
this could solve for the organ donation shortage that many countries experience .
<Sync time="58.515"/>
this could solve you know the need for prosthetics which are often unwieldy and comparatively less valuable than just having a limb in the first place .
<Sync time="67.420"/>
we think then that
<Sync time="68.520"/>
even if you buy all of government's arguments
<Sync time="71.220"/>
about the suffering endured by clones
<Sync time="73.640"/>
we think that there are massive impacts on the medical community and medical research
<Sync time="78.075"/>
in a way that greatly outweighs it .
<Sync time="80.140"/>
this is true for two reasons .
<Sync time="82.200"/>
first
<Sync time="83.310"/>
we think that the rights of clones are questionable .
<Sync time="86.300"/>
um at the point where de-
<Sync time="88.490"/>
we derive human rights you know from a specifically human centric perspective we often for example don't extend the same rights to
<Sync time="95.980"/>
animals as we do to humans .
<Sync time="97.680"/>
we think there is something innate about membership in humanity
<Sync time="101.430"/>
that gives you
<Sync time="101.990"/>
rights .
<Sync time="102.635"/>
at that point then we think it is unlikely that people will value kit
<Sync time="106.560"/>
clones as like having individual rights -
<Sync time="109.065"/>
but secondly we think this was more signet-
<Sync time="111.660"/>
a more significant issue .
<Sync time="113.105"/>
because we believe that there are just going to be like more regular people than there will be clones
<Sync time="118.760"/>
especially in the early days we imagine the clones will be incredibly expensive to develop
<Sync time="123.805"/>
so
<Sync time="124.400"/>
given that we think then that the uh
<Sync time="126.810"/>
the medical benefits associated with it will benefit
<Sync time="130.330"/>
billions of people
<Sync time="131.800"/>
whereas on the rights infringements upon clones will be relatively minimal due to the small number of clones .
<Sync time="138.730"/>
our second independent point is that we think that this can literally just make for better people .
<Sync time="144.040"/>
so gov has like a lot of hand wringing over
<Sync time="146.725"/>
whether or not
<Sync time="147.810"/>
um
<Sync time="148.220"/>
you know companies or firms or whatever are going to self select for traits that they find desirable .
<Sync time="153.500"/>
i think that this is probably a good thing though
<Sync time="155.870"/>
because a lot of the times the traits that would be selected for
<Sync time="159.140"/>
are traits that are generally pretty widely accepted as good things by society .
<Sync time="164.590"/>
like for all the hand wringing about like eugenics or whatever i think the comparative here is that we're not going to eradicate the people that have traits were trying to root out
<Sync time="173.820"/>
we'll obviously still continue to provide for people that for example
<Sync time="177.760"/>
have heart conditions at birth .
<Sync time="179.865"/>
but we also think that it's nice to have a system wherein we can
<Sync time="183.280"/>
genetically select for genes that make you less likely to have heart conditions .
<Sync time="187.995"/>
at that point then we think that the select a the research associate with cloning can make this an easier process
<Sync time="193.890"/>
but b that by creating clones that are biologically comparable to humans
<Sync time="198.510"/>
we can literally just have clones
<Sync time="200.650"/>
enter the gene pool
<Sync time="201.925"/>
and like create a gene pool that
<Sync time="204.625"/>
you know reduces the number of people with you know
<Sync time="207.205"/>
medical complications at birth and that sort of thing .
<Sync time="209.820"/>

<Sync time="210.800"/>
our third and final independent point is that we think that clones have utility in and of themselves .
<Sync time="215.790"/>
so i think
<Sync time="216.620"/>
a lot of what i've discussed already kind of demonstrates this at a very uh
<Sync time="219.950"/>
big scale level but we think even at an individual level
<Sync time="223.230"/>
clones can just make for a better society .
<Sync time="225.820"/>
um i think much like say in like brave new world there's like a world where you can just make clones that aren't necessarily self aware that are almost like animals to an extent
<Sync time="234.420"/>
and at that point then we think a lot of the labor benefits that you incur from having clones at a cheap
<Sync time="239.730"/>
level
<Sync time="240.930"/>
are fairly acceptable
<Sync time="242.510"/>
um because they would have a right structure that's relatively comparable to animals .
<Sync time="246.485"/>
but we also think that that utility derives from the fact that you're essentially telling a few clones superhumans
<Sync time="252.710"/>
that they have to sort of sacrifice their rights for the good of
<Sync time="255.390"/>
for the greater good
<Sync time="256.420"/>
and we think that infringement of rights upon a select group of clones
<Sync time="259.860"/>
is signi-
<Sync time="260.360"/>
makes it worth the up vast benefits that would be brought to humanity . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="265.515"/>
