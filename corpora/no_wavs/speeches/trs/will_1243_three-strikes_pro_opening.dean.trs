i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should abolish three-strikes laws .
<Sync time="5.870"/>
three independent points .
<Sync time="7.320"/>
the first being that these laws are fundamentally unfair .
<Sync time="12.440"/>
the reason that we have
<Sync time="13.540"/>
protections for uh
<Sync time="14.765"/>
against cruel and unusual punishment in the united states
<Sync time="18.130"/>
is simple .
<Sync time="19.170"/>
inmates
<Sync time="19.970"/>
despite having you know committed crimes
<Sync time="22.260"/>
still
<Sync time="22.990"/>
actually have rights that they are you know people who experience suffering and that when we can mitigate that suffering
<Sync time="29.910"/>
um we obviously should . um this
<Sync time="32.525"/>
you know fundamentally the reason that like we don't
<Sync time="35.300"/>
penalize like minor offenses with the death penalty that
<Sync time="38.620"/>
to some extent we want punishment to actually be proportionate to the crime .
<Sync time="42.920"/>
we don't think then and that just because something is broadly classified as a felony
<Sync time="47.760"/>
that
<Sync time="48.200"/>
committing it three times justifies a life sentence .
<Sync time="51.270"/>
you know something like robbery uh being classified as a felony for example
<Sync time="56.350"/>
doesn't mean that if i rob a convenience store three times
<Sync time="59.260"/>
i just go to jail for the rest of my life .
<Sync time="62.060"/>
like i think at some fundamental level we just have to recognize
<Sync time="65.845"/>
that
<Sync time="66.480"/>
even if this does have a deterrent effect , which i will address later as to why it most likely doesn't ,
<Sync time="71.840"/>
there just isn't a reasonable basis upon which we can say that this is a fair punishment .
<Sync time="77.060"/>
and fairness is quite important in our criminal justice system .
<Sync time="80.240"/>
we want a system that actually responds properly to the nature of the crime .
<Sync time="85.160"/>
a , because those inmates do have rights
<Sync time="87.760"/>
but
<Sync time="88.345"/>
b , because we want the perception that the state actually acts within the interests of its citizens .
<Sync time="94.410"/>
at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="95.700"/>
these inmates are still citizens of the united states or the state that they operate within .
<Sync time="100.700"/>
as such
<Sync time="101.840"/>
it seems
<Sync time="102.440"/>
fundamentally to be a breach of the social
<Sync time="106.220"/>
contra- contract then
<Sync time="107.100"/>
to enforce draconian
<Sync time="108.865"/>
rules upon them .
<Sync time="110.710"/>
our second independent point
<Sync time="112.355"/>
is that this is an expensive system .
<Sync time="114.895"/>
so when you increase penalties to such an incredible degree ,
<Sync time="119.395"/>
you inevitably result in prison overcrowding .
<Sync time="122.920"/>
um this is already a problem in california before the three-strike laws
<Sync time="127.135"/>
but the three-strike laws certainly have not helped that .
<Sync time="130.130"/>
in fact they have made it
<Sync time="131.870"/>
exceptionally exceptionally easier
<Sync time="134.720"/>
um to incarcerate individuals for prolonged amounts of time
<Sync time="138.380"/>
and then that generates significant expense to the state .
<Sync time="141.320"/>
we think that this is a problem ,
<Sync time="143.135"/>
not just because prison overcrowding in its own right as a right violation which it is because that
<Sync time="148.600"/>
results in frequently resource deprivation and a
<Sync time="151.150"/>
lack of personal space ,
<Sync time="152.805"/>
but also because it puts a
<Sync time="154.850"/>
onerous burden on the taxpayer .
<Sync time="156.930"/>
i think really the only defensible line that is often you know touted by proponents of the three-strikes laws is that it
<Sync time="163.060"/>
you know cleans up the streets , it makes it safer for non-offenders .
<Sync time="166.480"/>
the problem is that that in and of itself is just like a benefit to non-offenders .
<Sync time="171.535"/>
so if the trade-off then
<Sync time="173.220"/>
is absurd absurd wastes of public money and taxpayer money ,
<Sync time="177.605"/>
i don't think that the impact calculus actually favors the three-strike laws ,
<Sync time="181.845"/>
even when only analyzed from the perspective of non-offenders .
<Sync time="185.640"/>
this is just a burden that you're putting on people
<Sync time="188.250"/>
um for what is an unclear return .
<Sync time="190.980"/>
and that unclear return part leads me into my third and final point that
<Sync time="194.890"/>
the deterrence
<Sync time="196.050"/>
uh factor of three-strikes laws is
<Sync time="198.320"/>
unclear
<Sync time="199.000"/>
at best .
<Sync time="199.545"/>
um a recent study in twenty twelve conducted at u_c riverside found that there's
<Sync time="203.780"/>
actually very little reason to believe that the statistical decrease in crime in california
<Sync time="209.020"/>
had anything to do with the three-strikes laws ,
<Sync time="211.150"/>
but actually rather with decreased
<Sync time="212.820"/>
alcohol consumption .
<Sync time="214.640"/>
the reality is that we tend to look at the three-strikes laws is a driving factor in you know
<Sync time="219.260"/>
decreases %hes in crime
<Sync time="221.300"/>
but the reality is that there are just
<Sync time="223.105"/>
significant other factors that can easily explain this
<Sync time="226.290"/>
and from a logical perspective
<Sync time="228.090"/>
most felonies are committed in the heat of the moment ,
<Sync time="230.770"/>
which is why it's unreasonable then to assume that stricter penalties and punishments
<Sync time="235.485"/>
are a meaningful deterrent against committing those crimes .
<Sync time="238.825"/>
even absent all the rights violations arguments put forward then
<Sync time="242.730"/>
it's just unclear what the benefits of this policy are if it doesn't do anything to mitigate crime . proud to propose .
<Sync time="250.979"/>
