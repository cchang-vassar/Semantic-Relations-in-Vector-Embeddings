we should introduce covenant marriages .
<Sync time="2.895"/>
to be clear
<Sync time="3.940"/>
we wouldn't institute a system in which covenant marriage is
<Sync time="6.920"/>
mandated but rather
<Sync time="8.395"/>
we would allow for there to be a legal option
<Sync time="10.805"/>
to
<Sync time="11.435"/>
uh be bound
<Sync time="12.370"/>
under a covenant marriage as opposed to a standard marriage that exists within society .
<Sync time="16.375"/>
and this would of course would come with the constraints
<Sync time="18.560"/>
of making it much more difficult to receive a divorce
<Sync time="21.370"/>
um with different types of pressure being placed on the individual to ensure that they stay married in the long run .
<Sync time="26.735"/>
we would say that these covenant marriages can be annulled
<Sync time="29.880"/>
if certain requirements would be met but we've set those apartments
<Sync time="32.880"/>
at a much higher level than marriages are in the status quo .
<Sync time="35.365"/>
okay
<Sync time="36.900"/>
so firstly ,
<Sync time="37.745"/>
about the option for religious expression .
<Sync time="40.185"/>
and the secondly , what long term marriage does
<Sync time="42.430"/>
as a social good .
<Sync time="43.585"/>
recognize that
<Sync time="45.155"/>
even if society doesn't believe that should
<Sync time="47.385"/>
adopt certain religious values ,
<Sync time="49.460"/>
having the option of a covenant marriage um
<Sync time="51.970"/>
option that
<Sync time="52.725"/>
recognizes the importance religiously
<Sync time="55.220"/>
of not having divorce , of staying married ,
<Sync time="57.370"/>
does not ensure that a state
<Sync time="58.780"/>
endorses any particular religion , but
<Sync time="60.760"/>
rather simply gives individuals within that state
<Sync time="63.490"/>
an option of more full religious expression .
<Sync time="66.590"/>
it means that individuals can go to a gro- or go to the state
<Sync time="70.330"/>
and have something
<Sync time="71.160"/>
legally bonding placed upon them
<Sync time="73.180"/>
that helps them stay true to their faith .
<Sync time="75.310"/>
we think this is important because for those most faithful individuals ,
<Sync time="78.620"/>
we think that they should be forced to consider the ramifications of their decision 
<Sync time="82.530"/>
more clearly 
<Sync time="83.510"/>
before they get married . they should be forced to recognize
<Sync time="86.055"/>
that the bond they are taking ,
<Sync time="87.820"/>
even if it is not in the status quo
<Sync time="89.540"/>
legally binding
<Sync time="90.900"/>
in perpetuity ,
<Sync time="91.860"/>
is one that because of their belief system ,
<Sync time="94.015"/>
is permanently binding . and we think that
<Sync time="96.255"/>
if a state apparatus can allow for that faith to be more meaningfully expressed ,
<Sync time="100.550"/>
if it can allow for that faith
<Sync time="102.080"/>
to be more fully expressed , and if it puts constraints that makes people seriously consider their faith
<Sync time="107.500"/>
more , when it only applies to individuals
<Sync time="110.150"/>
that have that faith, we think there is no loss
<Sync time="112.890"/>
in instituting this type of system .
<Sync time="114.840"/>
we think it's good
<Sync time="115.960"/>
that individuals are able to have the most full type of religious expression
<Sync time="120.320"/>
because these types of religions
<Sync time="121.800"/>
these types of religious beliefs about marriage
<Sync time="123.940"/>
and about connection with a spouse
<Sync time="125.560"/>
are so fulfilling to
<Sync time="126.615"/>
individuals in the status quo .
<Sync time="128.960"/>
so aside from the religious benefits ,
<Sync time="130.840"/>
we think that there are real benefits to long term marriage 
<Sync time="133.910"/>
that a covenant marriage
<Sync time="135.010"/>
helps to protect because it makes it such uh
<Sync time="137.255"/>
much more difficult to get
<Sync time="138.305"/>
divorced .
<Sync time="139.040"/>
firstly , it ensures that if you uh
<Sync time="141.880"/>
it insures that because you're thinking more about your marriage
<Sync time="144.530"/>
you're more likely to marry someone that is going to be a stable partner . so whether or not you love your partner ,
<Sync time="149.420"/>
a permanent partner does allow for an immense amount of financial
<Sync time="152.710"/>
and social security
<Sync time="154.250"/>
even in instances when you may be struggling . when you're tied to someone
<Sync time="157.845"/>
and when you have a partner in life that is going through the same types of struggles you are , that is bound to your struggles ,
<Sync time="163.450"/>
it makes it much easier to bear the burden of that struggle .
<Sync time="166.720"/>
it also means that if you're having a long term marriage ,
<Sync time="169.270"/>
you're much more likely to have a stable household for any potential children .
<Sync time="172.450"/>
children have no choice about what type of familial household
<Sync time="175.950"/>
they're going to be born in
<Sync time="177.115"/>
and it's just statistically true
<Sync time="178.905"/>
that single parent households
<Sync time="180.495"/>
are much more likely to lead to a situation which a child struggles
<Sync time="183.930"/>
moving forward in life .
<Sync time="185.220"/>
we think that covenant marriages , because it makes it more difficult to get divorced ,
<Sync time="188.870"/>
is more likely to ensure
<Sync time="190.240"/>
that you don't have single parent households .
<Sync time="192.920"/>
that you have a situation
<Sync time="194.125"/>
in which both parents feel a responsibility
<Sync time="196.345"/>
to stay for the child .
<Sync time="197.840"/>
finally we think because we think
<Sync time="199.850"/>
finally we think there's a benefit some think that you're less likely to get into a legal battle a-
<Sync time="203.630"/>
over assets which can be
<Sync time="205.365"/>
not only struggling and uh
<Sync time="206.650"/>
detrimental to any sort of semblance of relationship you have with the person you're getting divorced from ,
<Sync time="211.250"/>
but can also leave you in immense destitution
<Sync time="213.890"/>
moving forward in life .
<Sync time="215.170"/>
we think that marriage as an institution allows you to have a partner ,
<Sync time="218.640"/>
allows you to support
<Sync time="219.905"/>
children potentially and allows you to be in a more stable situation . given that covenant marriage is not mandated but rather an option . we see no downsides the government introducing it
<Sync time="229.480"/>
and that's why we should introduce covenant marriage .
<Sync time="232.245"/>
