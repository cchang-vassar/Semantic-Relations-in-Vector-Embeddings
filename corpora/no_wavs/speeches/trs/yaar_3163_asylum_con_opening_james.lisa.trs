i think that the prime minister
<Sync time="1.750"/>
has been a little unfair
<Sync time="3.410"/>
or at the very least unclear enough in his definition
<Sync time="6.190"/>
of what we are debating here
<Sync time="7.720"/>
because his entire speech
<Sync time="9.780"/>
focuses on how we must ba- like
<Sync time="12.385"/>
better make or sure better enforce
<Sync time="14.430"/>
that the people
<Sync time="15.365"/>
who are being granted asylums
<Sync time="17.100"/>
are standing up to the criteria
<Sync time="18.910"/>
of who actually deserves it
<Sync time="20.610"/>
and
<Sync time="21.330"/>
uh that you know
<Sync time="22.350"/>
ordinary immigrants aren't just taking advantage of this by falsely pretending to be worthy of asylums
<Sync time="27.440"/>
and we totally agree .
<Sync time="28.765"/>
we don't have any interest in people being granted asylums without them actually deserving it .
<Sync time="33.635"/>
the thing is that in today's reality with the ongoing civil war in syria ,
<Sync time="38.020"/>
there truly is a significant rise in refugees that do stand up to the criterion and that do actually deserve it .
<Sync time="44.095"/>
so i think that
<Sync time="45.890"/>
it is side government's burden in this debate
<Sync time="48.240"/>
to defend things like setting stricter quotas of exactly how many asylums
<Sync time="52.860"/>
are granted
<Sync time="53.740"/>
that are necessarily going to leave out
<Sync time="56.000"/>
certain refugees
<Sync time="57.135"/>
that do deserve it .
<Sync time="58.360"/>
not just to say that we need to better look out for fraudulent claims because this is just simply
<Sync time="63.115"/>
pretty obvious .
<Sync time="64.700"/>
so it is in this light that we turn now to answer
<Sync time="68.240"/>
side government's claims .
<Sync time="70.200"/>
first , they tell us that the government needs to first and foremost look out for its own citizens and the influx of unskilled labor
<Sync time="77.930"/>
is
<Sync time="78.645"/>
harmful for the economy and comes at the expense of the citizens .
<Sync time="82.580"/>
so the first answer here is that we are just unsure that it truly is harmful for the economy .
<Sync time="87.560"/>
even if it is unskilled labor .
<Sync time="89.380"/>
as long as we strive to make them fit in and help them find jobs
<Sync time="93.090"/>
they
<Sync time="93.700"/>
certainly might contribute to the economy just like any other form
<Sync time="97.700"/>
of unskilled foreign labor .
<Sync time="99.720"/>
you know
<Sync time="100.360"/>
researchers looking into this question
<Sync time="102.450"/>
today are at the very least
<Sync time="103.980"/>
undecided if not even actually leaning in favor
<Sync time="107.280"/>
of it
<Sync time="108.125"/>
and we mustn't forget that america has been billed as a safe haven for immigrants and refugees that were fleeing harsh circumstances
<Sync time="116.315"/>
and
<Sync time="116.875"/>
it emerged as the free world's leading superpower .
<Sync time="120.540"/>
second answer here is that even if it is a burden to some degree ,
<Sync time="124.700"/>
we think that we simply cannot just
<Sync time="127.310"/>
um ignore
<Sync time="129.320"/>
the
<Sync time="130.410"/>
moral meaning of sealing the gates .
<Sync time="133.840"/>
it's true that the country is obligated to the well being of its citizens
<Sync time="138.880"/>
but this is not an absolute principle .
<Sync time="142.150"/>
like
<Sync time="142.515"/>
totally that is to say
<Sync time="144.015"/>
it doesn't mean that we can justify complete indifference to the unbearable misery of other people just because
<Sync time="150.070"/>
this will create
<Sync time="150.940"/>
mild inconvenience to our citizens
<Sync time="153.505"/>
and the third answer is that we think that's
<Sync time="156.140"/>
the foreign policy of the west in general , in the united states specifically ,
<Sync time="160.980"/>
has a hand in bringing upon the horrific situation in syria
<Sync time="165.590"/>
by refusing to intervene in time
<Sync time="168.285"/>
and by seceding the control over to russia
<Sync time="170.970"/>
that is backing
<Sync time="171.910"/>
assad .
<Sync time="172.830"/>
the very least that we can do
<Sync time="174.505"/>
is not to meet
<Sync time="175.680"/>
these refugees fleeing there with a shrug and a cold shoulder .
<Sync time="180.140"/>
the next thing that we hear is that people will take advantage and cheat .
<Sync time="184.660"/>
well there is there are always people that
<Sync time="186.990"/>
will take advantage of loopholes . this is just a part of reality but again ,
<Sync time="191.220"/>
we are totally in favor of taking whatever step
<Sync time="194.270"/>
is necessary to minimize this .
<Sync time="197.030"/>
lastly they tell us that if we won't limit the a silence now ,
<Sync time="200.540"/>
then populist leaders will
<Sync time="202.230"/>
take care of getting rid of it altogether later
<Sync time="205.195"/>
and we think that this logic is basically
<Sync time="207.915"/>
just giving up to populism .
<Sync time="209.940"/>
we think that if anything , it is the other way around .
<Sync time="212.820"/>
if we start compromising on our principles now , it will be that much easier to get rid of them completely
<Sync time="218.570"/>
later .
<Sync time="219.160"/>
besides we think that populist leaders like trump
<Sync time="222.365"/>
don't really concern themselves with the facts and the correct
<Sync time="226.255"/>
data of ho- just how much
<Sync time="228.260"/>
asylums are being granted today .
<Sync time="230.085"/>
this is what makes them populist .
<Sync time="231.900"/>
this means that no matter how much asylums that we're going to grant
<Sync time="235.870"/>
trump will always
<Sync time="237.690"/>
exaggerate and blow up the numbers in order to serve his own message .
<Sync time="241.600"/>
so
<Sync time="242.325"/>
what
<Sync time="243.250"/>
side government is proposing makes very little difference .
<Sync time="246.480"/>
look we've already shut down the doors before
<Sync time="248.940"/>
to refugees like
<Sync time="250.275"/>
for instance jewish refudee- refugees
<Sync time="252.855"/>
escaping persecution and mass murder in europe .
<Sync time="256.215"/>
that is one of
<Sync time="257.360"/>
the most shameful episodes in american history .
<Sync time="260.280"/>
let's not repeat the same policies now .
<Sync time="262.865"/>
oppose the motion .
<Sync time="264.447"/>
