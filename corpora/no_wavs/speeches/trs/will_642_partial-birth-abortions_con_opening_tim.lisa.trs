i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should ban partial birth abortions .
<Sync time="5.020"/>
so
<Sync time="5.650"/>
two independent points .
<Sync time="7.240"/>
first on the right to an abortion and why this procedure is facilitative to that right .
<Sync time="12.900"/>

<Sync time="13.500"/>
gov gives you a pretty good explanation of why there's a positive right to abortion .
<Sync time="17.370"/>
so i don't think that i need to rehash that too extensively
<Sync time="20.290"/>
but i do just want to note that first , there is
<Sync time="22.560"/>
not really a good standard by which to apply rights to a fetus ,
<Sync time="26.010"/>
but secondly ,
<Sync time="27.225"/>
that there is a bodily autonomy claim that is extremely important for these women .
<Sync time="32.290"/>
i think both of these justifications though are important
<Sync time="35.395"/>
because they don't change with the
<Sync time="38.270"/>
time n-
<Sync time="39.020"/>
frame in which you're actually applying the abortion .
<Sync time="41.455"/>
like if the fetus doesn't have rights it's because they don't have consciousness or
<Sync time="45.490"/>
because you know
<Sync time="46.470"/>
a potential person probably just isn't worth as much as an actual person in terms of how we apportion life .
<Sync time="53.220"/>
likewise with bodily autonomy
<Sync time="55.240"/>
your bodily autonomy does not go out the window just because you made the decision a couple months later .
<Sync time="60.230"/>
both of these are really important
<Sync time="61.890"/>
then
<Sync time="62.340"/>
because you continue having that right to an abortion
<Sync time="65.490"/>
even in like your eighth month of pregnancy or whatever .
<Sync time="69.070"/>
given that ,
<Sync time="69.760"/>
we think that
<Sync time="70.705"/>
there are grounds for needing this something like slat-
<Sync time="73.370"/>
tain- term changes and circumstance for how you would be capable of raising a child .
<Sync time="77.665"/>
you know
<Sync time="78.140"/>
suicidal depression which often can take a long time to develop
<Sync time="81.950"/>
if the you know
<Sync time="82.990"/>
pregnancy was uh
<Sync time="84.400"/>
for reasons that
<Sync time="86.055"/>
are actually necessarily triggering that can actually trigger like mental illnesses .
<Sync time="90.950"/>
this is important because
<Sync time="92.280"/>
insofar as there is
<Sync time="93.390"/>
any grounds for needing this ,
<Sync time="95.185"/>
we think that there should be a positive right to accessing the procedure .
<Sync time="98.790"/>
recognize that this isn't a popular option . it's like point two percent of all abortions
<Sync time="104.100"/>
and there's a good reason for that .
<Sync time="106.220"/>
not just the ban ,
<Sync time="107.410"/>
but because people don't like doing it .
<Sync time="109.580"/>
all the reasons that gov explains to you as to why this is a very visceral thing that people aren't wild about ,
<Sync time="115.220"/>
are also reasons why people don't like to do it themselves .
<Sync time="118.910"/>
this isn't something that happens frequently
<Sync time="121.060"/>
but we think that it's only used in extreme circumstances where it's exceptionally necessary ,
<Sync time="125.980"/>
where there really isn't another option and as a ru-
<Sync time="128.940"/>
result of that
<Sync time="129.890"/>
we need to preserve the right to actually have this procedure .
<Sync time="133.380"/>
our second independent point is politics .
<Sync time="136.030"/>
so we think that
<Sync time="137.110"/>
gov's
<Sync time="137.640"/>
real case really rests in this because they're first point that
<Sync time="140.590"/>
oh well you know they can do it sometime else in the procedure
<Sync time="143.890"/>
isn't really an argument the generous offense , that's just mitigating defense
<Sync time="147.800"/>
but the politics argument that they put forward
<Sync time="150.570"/>
that you know this is really visceral and people will be upset by it ,
<Sync time="153.960"/>
anti-abortion advocates will latch on to it as a way to do you know sort of demonstrate
<Sync time="158.185"/>
l- the horrors of abortion or whatever
<Sync time="160.645"/>
we think that actually quite the opposite happens
<Sync time="163.270"/>
that
<Sync time="163.610"/>
instituting a band gives an inch to anti-abortion
<Sync time="166.600"/>
acts
<Sync time="167.040"/>
activists by creating a precedent
<Sync time="169.190"/>
in like public discourse
<Sync time="171.080"/>
for fetal rights .
<Sync time="172.470"/>
this implicitly admits that there is
<Sync time="174.705"/>
some bright line at which you know the fetus actually house rights , that they have personhood ,
<Sync time="180.075"/>
and should be protected
<Sync time="181.560"/>
and
<Sync time="182.235"/>
i think this is really silly when you actually think about the underlying logic here right ? like if they have rights then you ban abortion outright because they're people .
<Sync time="189.670"/>
if they don't have rights , then there really shouldn't be any type of abortion that should be illegal because they don't have rights .
<Sync time="196.390"/>
like it's an either or situation and having a gray zone doesn't make any sense fundamentally
<Sync time="201.895"/>
and i think people realize this .
<Sync time="203.900"/>
like when you have bans on partial birth abortions and you implicitly admit that this is something that should be unacceptable ,
<Sync time="209.820"/>
then people latch on to this as a result as a you know just as an admission essentially
<Sync time="214.475"/>
that fetuses have rights .
<Sync time="216.025"/>
this is a problem then for people that actually want to increase access to these procedures
<Sync time="221.050"/>
because it spreads the
<Sync time="222.410"/>
uh increases the spread of anti-abortion arguments
<Sync time="224.955"/>
and the normalization of this type of discourse in the country .
<Sync time="227.875"/>
i think this is a really big issue
<Sync time="230.070"/>
and generally speaking ,
<Sync time="231.445"/>
you should be going for the holistic argument , one that is logically consistent ,
<Sync time="235.190"/>
one that says look fetuses just don't have rights . they are not people
<Sync time="239.545"/>
and as a result
<Sync time="240.585"/>
we think that it's really silly to extend them
<Sync time="242.900"/>
this right
<Sync time="243.720"/>
by banning these types of procedures . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="247.571"/>
