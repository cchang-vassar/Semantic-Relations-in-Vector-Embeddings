we should not introduce goal line technology .
<Sync time="3.260"/>
so ,
<Sync time="3.945"/>
i think what's important , for framing the discussion in this debate ,
<Sync time="6.860"/>
is to recognize what sport is actually about .
<Sync time="9.145"/>
because ,
<Sync time="9.995"/>
in
<Sync time="10.650"/>
oftentimes when people talk about sports , especially sfans- fans of sports ,
<Sync time="14.710"/>
there's often discussion of values , like valor , and honor , and tradition , and
<Sync time="18.710"/>
the spirit of athletics and competition , but recognize that sport , whether it's soccer ,
<Sync time="23.335"/>
whether it's
<Sync time="24.110"/>
basketball , or any o- baseball , or any type of sport ,
<Sync time="27.320"/>
these are all intrinsically about entertainment , whether it's at a l-
<Sync time="30.270"/>
at a young age , the entertainment of playing the sport ,
<Sync time="33.010"/>
the en- the entertainment of growing from the sport ,
<Sync time="35.390"/>
but as far as to goal line technology , as far as professionals ,
<Sync time="38.350"/>
it is solely about the entertainment that you can bring to fans . that
<Sync time="42.215"/>
the sport of soccer is-
<Sync time="44.200"/>
exists in order
<Sync time="45.265"/>
to make money for the owners of the team , to make money for the players , to make money for all the people involved in the creation
<Sync time="51.035"/>
of the product on the field ,
<Sync time="52.650"/>
and that what matters , when making this decision ,
<Sync time="55.030"/>
is what is going to be the best for fans . so , when people make claims about how
<Sync time="59.520"/>
goal line technology allows for more accuracy , and things like that ,
<Sync time="62.940"/>
that is not intrinsically valuable ,
<Sync time="65.210"/>
unless they can explain why it's valuable to the fans , why it gives a better fan
<Sync time="69.640"/>
experience .
<Sync time="70.570"/>
so ,
<Sync time="71.220"/>
we have
<Sync time="71.730"/>
three reasons why we think that , it's less likely to lead to a good fan experience ,
<Sync time="75.685"/>
and why we shouldn't introduce goal line technology , based on that reason .
<Sync time="79.040"/>
the first is that , it slows down the game .
<Sync time="81.100"/>
recognize that in soccer ,
<Sync time="82.430"/>
delays simply do not exist ,
<Sync time="84.450"/>
in- in the same way that they exist in other sports ,
<Sync time="86.725"/>
that soccer is
<Sync time="87.770"/>
largely about the flow of the game , about setting up plays ,
<Sync time="90.810"/>
about the back and forth ,
<Sync time="92.180"/>
and about ensuring that you can-
<Sync time="93.780"/>
that there's some sort of a flow and a rhythm to watching the game .
<Sync time="96.780"/>
we think that goal line technology is more likely to be invasive
<Sync time="100.015"/>
in soccer ,
<Sync time="101.100"/>
than it is in any other sport , that it's-
<Sync time="103.365"/>
that the flow of soccer , the flow of the game , is so much more important
<Sync time="106.605"/>
to the entertainment , to the product that you see , when you're watching the game on the pitch ,
<Sync time="111.035"/>
than it is in almost
<Sync time="112.195"/>
any other sport 
<Sync time="113.315"/>
in society . and given that this is the case , we think what's likely to happen is that fans
<Sync time="117.750"/>
are less likely to watch the product on the field ,
<Sync time="120.520"/>
even if they're not less likely to follow the sport generally ,
<Sync time="123.145"/>
they're less likely to actually give the views on the-
<Sync time="125.710"/>
on t_v ,
<Sync time="126.705"/>
and on the internet , that attracts- uh that
<Sync time="129.120"/>
provides ad revenue for these types
<Sync time="131.230"/>
of sports , and when that exists , we think that you're likely to get
<Sync time="134.270"/>
the downfall of the indun- not the downfall of the industry of sport , but you're less likely to get revenue from the
<Sync time="139.210"/>
sport , and that's bad for all actors involved in the sport .
<Sync time="142.020"/>
secondly , it removes faith in referees .
<Sync time="144.390"/>
so , we think that when you institute goal line technology ,
<Sync time="146.920"/>
you're less likely to have people have faith in referees , because it's a signaling affected : if you introduce this type of technology now ,
<Sync time="153.180"/>
it means that there's some sort of reason , that you think , that referees
<Sync time="156.110"/>
are not sufficient in doing their job , and yes ,
<Sync time="158.805"/>
it is the case that obviously ,
<Sync time="160.580"/>
voyeurs can see whether or not refs are right , when they can
<Sync time="163.520"/>
like look at the replay five seconds after ,
<Sync time="165.720"/>
and yes m sometimes refs are wrong ,
<Sync time="168.110"/>
but when you do this type of thing , you signal that you think refs
<Sync time="171.100"/>
are wrong so often ,
<Sync time="173.175"/>
that they need to have this type of thing , that
<Sync time="175.390"/>
interrupts the flow of the game , that literally stops the game for a number of minutes ,
<Sync time="178.985"/>
so they can go
<Sync time="180.015"/>
and watch one more time , or a number of times ,
<Sync time="182.770"/>
what happened right in front of them .
<Sync time="184.990"/>
given that that's the case ,
<Sync time="186.175"/>
and that there are the trade offs of interrupting the flow of the game ,
<Sync time="188.910"/>
we simply think you shouldn't send that signal to fans .
<Sync time="191.690"/>
finally , we think that there is , honestly , a tape of bonding that occurs
<Sync time="195.640"/>
in booing referees ,
<Sync time="197.020"/>
in booing officials , when they get something wrong .
<Sync time="199.890"/>
we think that as fans ,
<Sync time="201.290"/>
you
<Sync time="201.770"/>
experience the struggle of the team , when there's a mistake
<Sync time="204.815"/>
that happens on the field in the refereeing of the game ,
<Sync time="207.800"/>
and you become closer to the people on the field ,
<Sync time="210.500"/>
because you can empathize with what they're going through .
<Sync time="212.830"/>
they're struggling to win a game ,
<Sync time="214.455"/>
and in the moment , they've been stripped of something that a referee is wrong about ,
<Sync time="218.010"/>
it allows you to connect with the people on the field , and connect to the people in the stands , to bond .
<Sync time="222.255"/>
and yes ,
<Sync time="222.940"/>
it may mean that you get a less accurate reflection of the score on the field ,
<Sync time="226.520"/>
but it provides
<Sync time="227.450"/>
a more
<Sync time="228.240"/>
uh community oriented feel to the game , which is less like- which is more likely to attract people , to keep following the game , and increase revenue .
<Sync time="235.375"/>
 and it's ultimately
<Sync time="236.385"/>
more likely to be entertaining
<Sync time="238.490"/>
for people who interact with the sport . and for these reasons , we should not introduce
<Sync time="243.350"/>
goal line technology .
<Sync time="245.235"/>
