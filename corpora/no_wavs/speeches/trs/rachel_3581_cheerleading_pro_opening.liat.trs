we should
<Sync time="2.120"/>
end cheerleading .
<Sync time="3.880"/>
um two main areas of clash , first about the over-sexualization of youth .
<Sync time="8.420"/>
we think that it's true that
<Sync time="10.090"/>
cheerleading as a sport is entirely based on the sexualization of eighth grade to twelfth grade girls .
<Sync time="15.820"/>
we see this in terms of the revealing dance moves , the skimpy costumes ,
<Sync time="19.650"/>
and to the fact that they only exist in order to motivate
<Sync time="22.795"/>
male ballplayers on a field .
<Sync time="25.305"/>
um
<Sync time="26.090"/>
and the fact that it has always been majority marketed towards women
<Sync time="29.100"/>
and only started to include men when it became like a
<Sync time="31.815"/>
principled thing , like ah yes , let's have one or two men on the team who want to do it .
<Sync time="36.225"/>
we think that what this does is it preven- presents these girls as objects for male consumption ,
<Sync time="41.765"/>
and as such it influences the way that these people
<Sync time="44.840"/>
see them in the future .
<Sync time="46.180"/>
like if i'm a football player and
<Sync time="47.940"/>
i've been taught that these people are here to cheer me sp- like me on ,
<Sync time="51.680"/>
and here for my entertainment and my pleasure
<Sync time="54.050"/>
and like my motivation ,
<Sync time="55.570"/>
then why would this be something that i would recognize as like
<Sync time="58.455"/>
individual people
<Sync time="59.620"/>
who i ought treat with respect
<Sync time="61.100"/>
or with dignity ,
<Sync time="62.120"/>
if i have been taught that they don't actually deserve
<Sync time="64.310"/>
either of those things .
<Sync time="66.385"/>
we think that this
<Sync time="67.790"/>
influences
<Sync time="68.820"/>
these people into the long term , insofar as these become the like
<Sync time="71.970"/>
adults
<Sync time="72.630"/>
who also watch these kinds of things from the sidelines
<Sync time="75.485"/>
and see these individuals
<Sync time="76.930"/>
to be
<Sync time="77.545"/>
just as like sexualized and objectified for their use
<Sync time="80.810"/>
as the you- like %hes those who are younger .
<Sync time="83.680"/>
um it
<Sync time="84.310"/>
indicates this
<Sync time="85.360"/>
uh also it's like a generalizable thing to all women ,
<Sync time="88.150"/>
it says like look ,
<Sync time="89.105"/>
like women in general are sexually gratifying , they're here to service you ,
<Sync time="93.180"/>
and that's something that young men already learn from a really young age
<Sync time="95.920"/>
from other stimuli ,
<Sync time="97.110"/>
but something that gets
<Sync time="97.940"/>
massively reinforced
<Sync time="99.285"/>
when they see cheerleaders out on the field .
<Sync time="102.160"/>
this is especially problematic
<Sync time="103.660"/>
because it teaches
<Sync time="104.620"/>
young girls to see themselves in this way
<Sync time="107.015"/>
as well .
<Sync time="108.190"/>
like when society tells you that you are something for l- um long enough ,
<Sync time="111.740"/>
you tend to start believing it ,
<Sync time="113.350"/>
especially when this comes from figures of authority or people who you respect ,
<Sync time="117.170"/>
or if this is the way that like the majority of the men in your grade treat you ,
<Sync time="120.870"/>
if this is how you were taught you gain popularity , as we often see surrounding cheerleading culture in general ,
<Sync time="126.510"/>
and we think that's actually incredibly problematic .
<Sync time="129.095"/>
it poisons the ability of the self
<Sync time="131.990"/>
um to see yourself in an empowering manner
<Sync time="134.710"/>
and to see yourself as an equal to men specifically .
<Sync time="137.760"/>
we think this is actually quite {ob--vious/obvious} , like how do you see yourself as an equal to someone
<Sync time="141.550"/>
that you were taught you are an
<Sync time="143.100"/>
object for the pleasure of , like
<Sync time="145.280"/>
um we think that a lot of this also comes with signaling like the stereotype of the cheerleader who gets together
<Sync time="150.890"/>
with the
<Sync time="152.340"/>
with like the boy 
<Sync time="154.030"/>
%hes from the football team ,
<Sync time="155.760"/>
um
<Sync time="156.400"/>
and like this is something that
<Sync time="157.290"/>
teachers propagate in really subtle ways ,
<Sync time="159.590"/>
and so we actually don't see any kind of solution to this
<Sync time="162.960"/>
except to abolish the entire sport .
<Sync time="165.385"/>
um
<Sync time="166.295"/>
like given that it literally has no other purpose besides to objectify women and show that they are just objects for male consumption ,
<Sync time="173.110"/>
we don't understand why we ought value its existence
<Sync time="175.780"/>
at
<Sync time="176.245"/>
all .
<Sync time="176.855"/>
this brings us to our second area of clash , which is about working against
<Sync time="179.780"/>
the gendering of athletics .
<Sync time="181.200"/>
recognize that cheerleading is bla- is
<Sync time="183.050"/>
like represents a blatant creation of a sport
<Sync time="185.920"/>
just for women
<Sync time="187.020"/>
when there isn't actually a need .
<Sync time="188.955"/>
women are perfectly capable of doing things like football ,
<Sync time="191.825"/>
soccer ,
<Sync time="192.730"/>
dance .
<Sync time="193.330"/>
recognize that cheerleading is literally dance , um
<Sync time="196.310"/>
except dance usually doesn't in- in-
<Sync time="198.280"/>
doesn't have as many like sexually submissive undertones
<Sync time="201.605"/>
to it .
<Sync time="202.340"/>
so we actually think that like
<Sync time="203.530"/>
there's literally no unique niche that
<Sync time="205.810"/>
cheerleading fills ,
<Sync time="207.035"/>
so we don't understand why it exists in the first place .
<Sync time="209.970"/>
it's just there
<Sync time="211.400"/>
%hes to propagate the objectification of women
<Sync time="213.390"/>
in a society
<Sync time="214.470"/>
that tel- and like to tell us that we value boys more than girls ,
<Sync time="217.970"/>
which is why our girls are like relegated to this motivation
<Sync time="221.320"/>
role ,
<Sync time="221.920"/>
rather than being the focus of the game in the way that football players are .
<Sync time="225.570"/>
we think that what this is about
<Sync time="227.330"/>
is a round about whether w-
<Sync time="228.835"/>
what kind of options we provide
<Sync time="230.750"/>
and what kids are pushed toward ,
<Sync time="232.275"/>
and we're unclear on why there ought be an
<Sync time="234.650"/>
uh there ought be an option
<Sync time="236.300"/>
or an influence to do something like cheerleading that is clearly so detrimental ,
<Sync time="240.460"/>
um when there are sports that are infinitely less problematic out there . proud to propose .
