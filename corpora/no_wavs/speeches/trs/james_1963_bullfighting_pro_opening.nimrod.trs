bull fighting
<Sync time="1.260"/>
should be banned .
<Sync time="2.670"/>
so ,
<Sync time="3.140"/>
bullfighting
<Sync time="3.985"/>
is a traditional ,
<Sync time="5.425"/>
i don't know if you call it sport or a game ,
<Sync time="7.830"/>
where a matador
<Sync time="9.380"/>
lures a bull , and tries to kill it . it was ,
<Sync time="11.990"/>
i believe , invented in medieval spain  , and was popular in southern france , some other parts of europe ,
<Sync time="17.560"/>
spread to latin america from spain ,
<Sync time="19.790"/>
but predominantly is practice there .
<Sync time="22.290"/>
and we're saying that , it should be completely illegal
<Sync time="25.280"/>
uh b-
<Sync time="25.765"/>
there shouldn't be any phase out period , we would prefer that this happen tomorrow .
<Sync time="29.920"/>
so with that in mind , we have two main arguments for why it ought be banned .
<Sync time="33.145"/>
the first is that ,
<Sync time="34.660"/>
bullfighting is fundamentally cruel .
<Sync time="36.780"/>
recognize that , this is a game
<Sync time="38.520"/>
made of torturing 
<Sync time="39.940"/>
an animal . we see that ,
<Sync time="41.645"/>
even countries like spain have banned
<Sync time="43.730"/>
cock fighting ,
<Sync time="44.715"/>
and other sports which are cruel to animals , and we don't see why bullfighting
<Sync time="48.550"/>
should be unique .
<Sync time="50.400"/>
it seems clear that , bulls deserve moral consideration .
<Sync time="53.590"/>
recognize that , while
<Sync time="54.755"/>
cattle are not the most intelligent creatures ,
<Sync time="57.500"/>
that certainly they prefer
<Sync time="59.250"/>
uh pleasure to pain ,
<Sync time="61.240"/>
certainly , given the opportunity , they will avoid
<Sync time="64.045"/>
uh dying , they'll take steps to preserve their own lives ,
<Sync time="67.040"/>
they may not be as intelligent as human beings , but we can see that , clearly , their preference is being violated when they're killed ,
<Sync time="73.090"/>
uh verses when they're not .
<Sync time="74.925"/>
we think that ,
<Sync time="76.250"/>
moreover not only are they being killed , but they're tormented along the way . they're
<Sync time="79.600"/>
stabbed with swords , this is part of the game ,.
<Sync time="82.140"/>
we see that ,
<Sync time="83.280"/>
ultimately , this is much worse than other ways that animals are mistreated in our society ,
<Sync time="87.960"/>
like the meat industry , because
<Sync time="89.625"/>
the torture is part of the- the pleasure that people experience , when they see a bullfight .
<Sync time="95.510"/>
it seems
<Sync time="97.795"/>
that , at the point where you're violating the more- or the eh the wishes of a moral actor , that it's clear that this is
<Sync time="103.760"/>
unethical , and we think that , broadly speaking , state should intervene
<Sync time="107.200"/>
to protec- prevent unethical behavior .
<Sync time="109.670"/>
we see that other forms of animal cruelty had been banned ,
<Sync time="112.800"/>
not because they harm the state in any way ,
<Sync time="115.690"/>
but because they're seen as unethical . we see that it's
<Sync time="118.290"/>
uneth-
<Sync time="118.780"/>
or that it's banned for people to litter ,
<Sync time="121.210"/>
say , which is also an ethical .
<Sync time="123.210"/>
so it's clear that , governments intervene in this way regularly throughout europe .
<Sync time="127.110"/>
we think that ,
<Sync time="127.860"/>
bullfighting should not be special case ,
<Sync time="129.910"/>
just because it has some cultural legacy .
<Sync time="132.460"/>
things like
<Sync time="132.850"/>
cock fighting
<Sync time="133.790"/>
also have a cultural legacy , but they've been banned
<Sync time="136.285"/>
because they're fundamentally cruel .
<Sync time="138.660"/>
our second argument is that ,
<Sync time="141.470"/>
bullfighting harm spain's international image .
<Sync time="145.160"/>
when you remind people that spain is a country where the national sport is tormenting animals , i don't think anyone
<Sync time="150.735"/>
has a positive reaction to the country .
<Sync time="153.300"/>
we think that , particularly because spain's economy
<Sync time="155.900"/>
is so dependent on tourism , that this is something that they ought to be
<Sync time="159.570"/>
aware of .
<Sync time="160.870"/>
but moreover , we think that , on a european scale , this harm spain's image .
<Sync time="165.240"/>
other european countries take a much stricter line against animal cruelty .
<Sync time="169.760"/>
we think that it's very likely that , in the future , the european union is going to intervene , if spain continues to refuse
<Sync time="175.345"/>
to ban it in itself .
<Sync time="177.080"/>
what does that do to spain's international image , if the european union has to intervene
<Sync time="181.120"/>
to ban animal cruelty ?
<Sync time="183.040"/>
well , we think first of all that , it makes it look like the country's government is incompetent , which is already a risk given spain's
<Sync time="189.150"/>
poor governance leading up to and during the financial crisis .
<Sync time="193.140"/>
but two , we think it makes it more likely that the international community will be unsympathetic to spain in other spheres .
<Sync time="199.320"/>
so we think that , for instance , if catalonia , a region of spain which wants to secede ,
<Sync time="203.940"/>
takes this to the next level ,
<Sync time="205.620"/>
and request
<Sync time="206.310"/>
european or international intervention to support their secession ,
<Sync time="210.010"/>
that it's much more likely that people will be sympathetic ,
<Sync time="212.590"/>
especially given that catalonia has actually banned bullfighting , although it's a traditional sport there as well .
<Sync time="219.180"/>
in general ,
<Sync time="219.920"/>
no matter what spain wants to do in its involvement with the international community ,
<Sync time="223.780"/>
whether that be
<Sync time="224.770"/>
i_m_f loans , or hosting the olympics ,
<Sync time="227.285"/>
we think tat it will always be hindered by the fact
<Sync time="229.835"/>
that they have this stain on their national character ,
<Sync time="232.625"/>
in the form of bullfighting .
<Sync time="234.920"/>
so , because of the moral worth of the bull ,
<Sync time="237.060"/>
and also because of a harm to spain's image ,
<Sync time="239.350"/>
bullfighting
<Sync time="240.120"/>
should be banned ,
<Sync time="240.930"/>
thank you .
