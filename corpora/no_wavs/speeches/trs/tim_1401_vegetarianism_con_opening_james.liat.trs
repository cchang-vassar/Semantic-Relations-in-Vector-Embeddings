we should not adopt vegetarianism . 
<Sync time="3.490"/>
so , firstly what's important to recognize is that government defines this debate as one
<Sync time="7.735"/>
in which people have an obligation to adopt
<Sync time="10.205"/>
this type
<Sync time="11.155"/>
of lifestyle , to be a vegetarian , so we're going to explain
<Sync time="14.370"/>
firstly ,
<Sync time="15.135"/>
why animals simply do not deserve rights , and secondly we're going to respond to some of the arguments that they make
<Sync time="20.650"/>
about how meat production is simply a human harm and we have to respect the rights of humans , we're going to explain why adopting vegetarianism
<Sync time="27.550"/>
is not the only way that this can be done , and why that means you don't have an obligation to do this .
<Sync time="31.850"/>
okay . so firstly on animal rights .
<Sync time="34.015"/>
we want to say that
<Sync time="35.330"/>
rights are inherently a social construct , and what we mean by this
<Sync time="39.025"/>
is that
<Sync time="39.540"/>
rights don't just come objectively
<Sync time="41.460"/>
out of the universe around us , they aren't just these things that ethereally exist
<Sync time="45.420"/>
and are applied to humanity , but rather they are constructed by societies
<Sync time="49.310"/>
for the purpose of utility .
<Sync time="51.740"/>
societies create these rights for the purpose
<Sync time="53.940"/>
of making human lives more meaningful ,
<Sync time="56.420"/>
more valuable , and giving protections onto humans
<Sync time="59.290"/>
that are more fair .
<Sync time="60.210"/>
so why do we think that animals
<Sync time="62.140"/>
should not be included in this conversation ?
<Sync time="65.010"/>
well firstly , we think the whole purpose of rights
<Sync time="67.205"/>
is to only include those that are part
<Sync time="69.550"/>
of that
<Sync time="70.090"/>
dialogue , and even if that doesn't mean that
<Sync time="72.380"/>
and this doesn't mean that
<Sync time="73.645"/>
every single human being needs to be involved in the legislation of rights etcetera ,
<Sync time="77.660"/>
but people themselves are ethical actors , they can pose ethical queries ,
<Sync time="82.115"/>
and they can make
<Sync time="82.960"/>
ethical choices , but this simply isn't the case for animals . for example ,
<Sync time="87.270"/>
largely rights are based on a reciprocal nature ,
<Sync time="89.745"/>
and what this means is that 
<Sync time="91.140"/>
people respect my rights because
<Sync time="93.050"/>
i consent and i choose to protect their rights , and this is where punishment comes in ,
<Sync time="97.490"/>
and basically every legal system in the world insofar as
<Sync time="100.490"/>
when i
<Sync time="101.115"/>
stop choosing to respect your rights , when i stop reciprocating
<Sync time="104.785"/>
those rights to you ,
<Sync time="106.370"/>
then my rights become void and that is why
<Sync time="108.795"/>
i can be punished . but this isn't the case for animals . animals have no
<Sync time="112.895"/>
cognitive ability to respect the rights of other people 
<Sync time="115.855"/>
and therefore we can't hold them to the same standard ,
<Sync time="118.345"/>
and they fall out of the frame
<Sync time="119.720"/>
of discussion . furthermore , they can't
<Sync time="121.420"/>
internalize rights . so even if we were to give animals rights , we were to say
<Sync time="125.365"/>
we're going to ensure that all animals have these ten rights ,
<Sync time="128.680"/>
uh there's no way for them to understand that rights have been placed upon them and therefore they can't internalize the value of those rights ,
<Sync time="134.885"/>
and they can't act upon those rights .
<Sync time="137.000"/>
so , given that this is the case , and f-
<Sync time="139.410"/>
furthermore that animals are just not a part
<Sync time="141.760"/>
of our society ,
<Sync time="142.770"/>
they aren't a part of our social constructs .
<Sync time="145.120"/>
yes , we may have pets and then we give certain rights to those pets , but this isn't what this debate is about . this is about whether or not
<Sync time="150.660"/>
farm animals deserve the same level of rights
<Sync time="153.280"/>
as humans , or even any sort of rights at all .
<Sync time="156.060"/>
given that animals are not part of that construct ,
<Sync time="158.695"/>
and given that animals can't reciprocate or respond to rights in any way ,
<Sync time="162.750"/>
we don't think that they have these types of rights .
<Sync time="164.920"/>
if we think that suffering is bad and that we should prevent suffering , there's way to t-
<Sync time="168.690"/>
to do that
<Sync time="169.500"/>
without adopting vegetarianism ,
<Sync time="171.400"/>
but we don't think that that is something that is
<Sync time="173.485"/>
meaningful uh
<Sync time="174.590"/>
about animals , it's about how we internalize
<Sync time="177.500"/>
and respond to
<Sync time="178.510"/>
animal
<Sync time="179.040"/>
harm , it's not about
<Sync time="180.390"/>
applying rights to animals themselves , and therefore we don't think you need to adopt vegetarianism 
<Sync time="185.290"/>
because animals themselves have rights . so finally , on meat production , responding to the government side
<Sync time="190.485"/>
a little bit .
<Sync time="191.220"/>
we think that these harms can be alleviated
<Sync time="193.470"/>
in a number of other ways .
<Sync time="194.870"/>
first ,
<Sync time="195.360"/>
you can cut consumption . so even if you want to be ethical in how you grow
<Sync time="199.470"/>
these %hes uh
<Sync time="199.945"/>
meat and and what not how
<Sync time="201.945"/>
uh
<Sync time="202.500"/>
the amount of input that goes into meat . you could just cut your consumption , instead of eating meat five days a week you can eat it one day a week ,
<Sync time="208.575"/>
and that's a way to
<Sync time="209.930"/>
kind of help the burden that meat creates without becoming a vegetarian .
<Sync time="213.730"/>
you can also increase prices as a farmer .
<Sync time="216.000"/>
and finally , you can limit
<Sync time="217.240"/>
land allocation
<Sync time="218.405"/>
for the production of meat . so if
<Sync time="220.320"/>
land allocation and the use of land is so inefficient and so harmful 
<Sync time="224.315"/>
that it is harming humanity , you can create regulations to
<Sync time="227.850"/>
allocate only
<Sync time="228.630"/>
a certain amount of land for that ,
<Sync time="230.340"/>
but none of this involves becoming a vegetarian ,
<Sync time="233.140"/>
none of this requires vegetarianism of people ,
<Sync time="236.135"/>
and therefore people do not have this obli- obligation .
<Sync time="239.125"/>
because of these reasons ,
<Sync time="240.590"/>
we should not adopt vegetarianism .
<Sync time="243.555"/>
