<Sync time="0.505"/>
when will argues against cosmetic surgery ,
<Sync time="3.430"/>
what he doesn't seem to understand is that societal standards are going to exist on both sides of the house
<Sync time="9.165"/>
and will get met either way .
<Sync time="11.525"/>
if i'm not spending that money
<Sync time="13.530"/>
on changing my waist cosmetically
<Sync time="15.855"/>
i am wearing a binder or a
<Sync time="18.700"/>
um corset
<Sync time="19.670"/>
that is a lot more physically damaging to me ,
<Sync time="22.090"/>
oftentimes cost just as much ,
<Sync time="24.590"/>
and i am still meeting the same beauty stereotypes .
<Sync time="27.570"/>
women who have
<Sync time="28.615"/>
too much money for their own good and hate their bodies are going to find a way to satisfy those standards
<Sync time="34.350"/>
regardless .
<Sync time="35.300"/>
what this round is about
<Sync time="36.865"/>
is whether or not they ought be able to choose the method by which they do so
<Sync time="40.870"/>
and whether paternalism is justified .
<Sync time="43.370"/>
we tell you that we prefer a safer way
<Sync time="46.065"/>
but more than that
<Sync time="47.310"/>
that it is still a woman's right to model herself in the male gaze
<Sync time="51.320"/>
even if it is something that is bad for society writ large .
<Sync time="54.280"/>
we think this is about
<Sync time="55.280"/>
the individual woman's choice and what empowers
<Sync time="57.795"/>
her
<Sync time="58.500"/>
not about societal reaction .
<Sync time="60.730"/>
two main areas of clash .
<Sync time="62.505"/>
the first on the standards of a ban .
<Sync time="64.675"/>
it is generally accepted that a democratic government
<Sync time="67.980"/>
can ban something if there is either a large personal harm that requires paternalism
<Sync time="72.665"/>
or if large third party harm that allows you to paternalize an individual's choices .
<Sync time="77.700"/>
will says but society and the reinforcement of stereotypes .
<Sync time="83.390"/>
the problem with this is that as we told you ,
<Sync time="85.980"/>
these beauty standards are already there .
<Sync time="88.330"/>
at most , there is a marginal reinforcement
<Sync time="91.180"/>
when the top one percent
<Sync time="92.790"/>
meets them with cosmetic surgery .
<Sync time="94.710"/>
we think the vast majority of people
<Sync time="96.650"/>
are still not doing it in order to look the way the men want
<Sync time="100.095"/>
or they like if only because they simply do not have the money to do so .
<Sync time="103.840"/>
on a personal level ,
<Sync time="105.520"/>
will did not address any problems
<Sync time="107.510"/>
and we tell you that this is because there aren't any .
<Sync time="110.390"/>
complications are rare but the esteem boost that women who make these decisions get
<Sync time="115.245"/>
is very real .
<Sync time="116.580"/>
it's not a harm but rather a benefit
<Sync time="118.635"/>
to take a feature that you have disliked your entire life
<Sync time="121.530"/>
and turn it into something that is pleasurable and that empowers you .
<Sync time="125.360"/>
but then will says it's such a useless expenditure .
<Sync time="129.430"/>
all we say to this is that you ought allow an individual to decide what is a useless expenditure .
<Sync time="134.885"/>
this is honestly a very dumb argument
<Sync time="137.220"/>
given that even in the example of a handbag ,
<Sync time="139.610"/>
most of that money still goes to a corporation .
<Sync time="142.620"/>
moreover , who cares ?
<Sync time="144.630"/>
we recognize that money is the property of an individual
<Sync time="147.360"/>
and do not paternalize the way in which it is spent
<Sync time="149.905"/>
because
<Sync time="150.550"/>
the standards for what is a useful expenditure versus not
<Sync time="153.820"/>
differs depending on who is looking at the expenditure .
<Sync time="156.940"/>
for some ,
<Sync time="157.790"/>
paying for a pet
<Sync time="159.290"/>
is a useless expenditure given that that pet is not utile to them
<Sync time="162.860"/>
but for others , it is a very good expenditure because they gain a lot from having that pet .
<Sync time="167.220"/>
cosmetic surgery is no different .
<Sync time="169.590"/>
are second area of clash has to do with cosmetic surgery as a form of empowerment .
<Sync time="173.910"/>
we think it is difficult to feel powerful if you're not feeling
<Sync time="176.870"/>
physically empowered
<Sync time="178.290"/>
and so it is good to allow women and men to empower themselves
<Sync time="181.935"/>
in a way that is safe and legal
<Sync time="184.740"/>
and within their own like power right ?
<Sync time="187.460"/>
like we think that it is
<Sync time="188.635"/>
good that if they hate a future for the majority of their lives
<Sync time="192.020"/>
they can do something that will fix it
<Sync time="193.835"/>
and then not hate
<Sync time="195.325"/>
hate themselves as much
<Sync time="196.785"/>
or feel more com- confident in the bedroom .
<Sync time="199.480"/>
we think that even if it is like
<Sync time="201.310"/>
marginally problematic that women get
<Sync time="204.215"/>
get um get like adjustments to their labia
<Sync time="207.135"/>
because they're told that long labias are bad ,
<Sync time="209.540"/>
we think you still net positive that they then feel more confident in the bedroom
<Sync time="213.530"/>
and more confident with their own bodies
<Sync time="215.615"/>
so that they can actually be intimate with another person .
<Sync time="218.510"/>
more than this , we tell you it's not always beauty standard based .
<Sync time="221.860"/>
sometimes it has to do with the way that someone feels their face is asymmetrical
<Sync time="225.900"/>
or in situations of trans-individuals ,
<Sync time="228.075"/>
where they want to appear more like the gender with which they identify .
<Sync time="231.355"/>
we think at the point that cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="233.530"/>
represents very real ways by which individuals can make themselves feel better
<Sync time="237.430"/>
and empower themselves
<Sync time="238.690"/>
to be more productive and happier individuals in the long term
<Sync time="242.020"/>
you ought not ban it .
<Sync time="243.180"/>
for these reasons , proud to
<Sync time="245.365"/>
oppose .
<Sync time="247.290"/>
