i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion
<Sync time="2.660"/>
that we should further exploit wind power .
<Sync time="5.600"/>
generally speaking
<Sync time="6.590"/>
we'd interpret this to mean that we should invest more money into building the infrastructure intrinsic to wind power
<Sync time="13.050"/>
so
<Sync time="13.535"/>
building more wind turbines that sort of thing
<Sync time="16.450"/>
and connecting it to the general infrastructure .
<Sync time="19.010"/>
two independent points :
<Sync time="20.850"/>
first
<Sync time="21.635"/>
is the cheap nature in the long term
<Sync time="24.100"/>
of renewable energy .
<Sync time="26.140"/>
when we look at the type of energy infrastructure that currently is the dominant factor in most countries
<Sync time="32.330"/>
fossil fuels
<Sync time="33.730"/>
this is something that is both
<Sync time="35.430"/>
unsustainable and expensive .
<Sync time="37.840"/>
it's expensive because there's a lot of steps intrinsic to using this type of fossil fuel
<Sync time="42.900"/>
a network
<Sync time="43.940"/>
that is you have to extract the energy from the ground .
<Sync time="47.050"/>
you have to ship the physical product to the place where it's going to be used .
<Sync time="51.130"/>
you have to build entire plants that are designed to actually convert that item
<Sync time="55.690"/>
into energy .
<Sync time="57.310"/>
this is a complicated and costly project
<Sync time="60.240"/>
and while right now it's relatively cheap 
<Sync time="62.850"/>
because these
<Sync time="63.970"/>
items are in abundance and because the technology is well developed ,
<Sync time="67.840"/>
the long term
<Sync time="69.100"/>
looks much better for renewable energy .
<Sync time="71.690"/>
this isn't just because it's like a thing that renews itself that once you build the wind turbine it just continues producing so the long term costs are lower .
<Sync time="81.370"/>
it's also because well
<Sync time="83.010"/>
firstly it's because
<Sync time="84.620"/>
you don't have to have that like physical thing you're moving around so you don't have to deal with those costs .
<Sync time="90.170"/>
secondly
<Sync time="91.075"/>
it's because in the long term you develop the technologies to an extent that the current barriers aren't very meaningful .
<Sync time="97.640"/>
so while right now
<Sync time="98.950"/>
affordable solar technology and affordable wind technology more importantly
<Sync time="102.955"/>
aren't particularly affordable
<Sync time="104.980"/>
if you research it they'll become affordable .
<Sync time="107.270"/>
but most importantly
<Sync time="109.120"/>
if you actually want like
<Sync time="111.050"/>
something that's going to continue providing energy to you
<Sync time="114.100"/>
fifty years from now
<Sync time="115.640"/>
finite resources that are rapidly depleting aren't going to do the job .
<Sync time="119.800"/>
you're not going to have a sustainable infrastructure for your energy needs
<Sync time="124.160"/>
if you are relying on something that will cease to exist within the next few decades .
<Sync time="128.640"/>
we think wind energy gives you a leg up on those renewables
<Sync time="131.975"/>
that allow you to have a sustainable infrastructure in the long term .
<Sync time="136.420"/>
our second independent point is global warming .
<Sync time="139.230"/>
so
<Sync time="139.885"/>
broadly speaking we don't think there's enough time in this speech to actually flush out the warrants used to why global warming is true .
<Sync time="147.080"/>
we'll just leave it at the fact that ninety seven percent of scientists agree that this is a thing and that generally speaking
<Sync time="153.020"/>
the climate science that explains the impacts of global warming
<Sync time="156.670"/>
is an overwhelming consensus .
<Sync time="158.960"/>
most scientists agree that this is a thing that exists
<Sync time="162.035"/>
and is very very bad for the planet .
<Sync time="165.180"/>
when we're talking about those impacts were talking about things like
<Sync time="168.220"/>
rising sea levels that will destroy coastal and
<Sync time="170.795"/>
habitations .
<Sync time="172.090"/>
we're talking about things like changing weather patterns that threaten the lives of millions of not billions of people around the world .
<Sync time="178.790"/>
we're talking about whether pattern changes that will cause mass extinction among animals .
<Sync time="183.300"/>
these are huge
<Sync time="184.300"/>
existential threats to humanity
<Sync time="186.570"/>
and to other species on this planet .
<Sync time="189.130"/>
this is a thing worth avoiding .
<Sync time="190.925"/>
and the thing that is contributing to it
<Sync time="193.050"/>
is fossil fuels
<Sync time="194.255"/>
and other types of greenhouse gases .
<Sync time="196.730"/>
so things like methane
<Sync time="198.435"/>
things like carbon dioxide that are produced by these types of fuels
<Sync time="202.600"/>
are a large driving factor in why global temperatures are rising .
<Sync time="207.400"/>
if we can mitigate
<Sync time="209.140"/>
the rate at which we put these types of harmful chemicals into our atmosphere
<Sync time="213.655"/>
that's always going to be a good thing .
<Sync time="215.730"/>
like
<Sync time="216.175"/>
even if we can't stop global warming dead in its tracks
<Sync time="219.440"/>
mitigating the significant impacts of it is always going to be a positive thing for the world .
<Sync time="225.090"/>
as such more meaningful investments in wind technology
<Sync time="228.585"/>
will always come at a zero sum cost to detract the amount we are investing in fossil fuels .
<Sync time="234.570"/>
obviously if we are putting the like political energy into creating sustainable energy infrastructure
<Sync time="240.860"/>
it will presumably have ripple effects throughout our entire system .
<Sync time="244.700"/>
given that we think that this creates
<Sync time="246.835"/>
a better environment for the future . proud to propose .
<Sync time="250.558"/>
