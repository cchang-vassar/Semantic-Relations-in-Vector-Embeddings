i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that physical education should be mandatory .
<Sync time="6.010"/>
first , just a quick overview on how ,
<Sync time="8.745"/>
you know , the burden structure in this round
<Sync time="10.500"/>
works .
<Sync time="11.060"/>
because
<Sync time="11.735"/>
g- generally speaking , when we're talking about whether or not a government should
<Sync time="15.635"/>
uh compel action by individuals ,
<Sync time="18.350"/>
um there's a couple standards that
<Sync time="20.520"/>
independently can be sufficient to justify that
<Sync time="23.710"/>
requirement . so ,
<Sync time="25.110"/>
what i mean by this is that
<Sync time="27.335"/>
obviously the opp line in this round is going to be something to the effect of , " well , you know , you're telling these kids that they got to do a thing , and it's better when you allow them to make the choice , " because
<Sync time="37.025"/>
individuals are more capable of making choices for themselves that some f-
<Sync time="40.525"/>
third-party actor .
<Sync time="41.860"/>
that's obviously a high standard that we hold in pretty high regard .
<Sync time="45.320"/>
so generally speaking then , we have high bars that we meet to ensure that , you know , that's not
<Sync time="50.440"/>
um
<Sync time="51.095"/>
that the d- that the restriction is justified .
<Sync time="53.720"/>
i see two , and these are going to be my two independent points .
<Sync time="56.775"/>
the first is if there is more or less objective good given to the individual
<Sync time="61.870"/>
um when you enact a restriction ,
<Sync time="64.290"/>
um so for example , restrictions that we put on uh cigarettes , for example ,
<Sync time="69.030"/>
um
<Sync time="69.715"/>
are more or less objective and this is why we are justified in doing them , also why we , you know , require
<Sync time="76.020"/>
uh academic um
<Sync time="78.470"/>
education in i- beyond just physical education .
<Sync time="81.290"/>
but secondly is when there's externalities . that is , you know , also looking at cigarettes , something like secondhand smoke ,
<Sync time="86.890"/>
something where we see that a person that didn't consent into the action is suffering consequences and as a result we are justified in restricting it
<Sync time="95.380"/>
because , you know , your autonomy doesn't extend to violating other people's preferences .
<Sync time="100.170"/>
on the first point , then , regarding objectivity ,
<Sync time="102.770"/>
i think there's a pretty obvious case to be made in terms of , you know , the health benefits of engaging in physical education .
<Sync time="109.450"/>
especially when children are quite young , there is a serious need to ensure that they are physically active .
<Sync time="114.705"/>
um this country's obesity epidemic really underlines how insufficient a job we are of doing %hes uh meeting that standard
<Sync time="122.090"/>
but
<Sync time="122.665"/>
, you know , just that small amount of physical activity a day , you know ,
<Sync time="125.670"/>
thirty minutes or whatever ,
<Sync time="127.460"/>
that really goes a long way in ensuring the child's long-term physical well-being .
<Sync time="132.520"/>
without that physical education ,
<Sync time="134.290"/>
there really isn't an
<Sync time="135.530"/>
meaningful check to ensure that they are doing that . i think
<Sync time="138.815"/>
a lot of the kids that are getting their proper exercise are the type of kids that are
<Sync time="142.585"/>
usually fine with doing p_e anyway . these are the more competitive kids , the more active ones .
<Sync time="147.695"/>
i think really what p_e is designed to do is to target the kids
<Sync time="150.940"/>
that aren't getting a sufficient amount of exercise on a daily basis ,
<Sync time="154.410"/>
because they're just not the type of per- the personality type that enjoys doing that on a regular basis .
<Sync time="159.455"/>
but it is still important to ensure that they get that physical education ,
<Sync time="163.150"/>
so the government probably is then man-
<Sync time="165.050"/>
justified in mandating it .
<Sync time="167.045"/>
on the second standard then ,
<Sync time="168.990"/>
regarding externalities ,
<Sync time="170.600"/>
i think a lot of this folds into healthcare costs . so , this was also flouted a lot during the uh sugary drinks debate around new york city .
<Sync time="178.330"/>
and what happens here is that
<Sync time="180.120"/>
when you have a substantial amount of people that are , you know ,
<Sync time="183.445"/>
not active enough and by extension , then , not healthy , their healthcare costs go up . this is , you know , fairly clear why this would happen , you know ,
<Sync time="191.870"/>
that they're more likely to have physical illnesses , they're going to be making more doctors visits , so on so forth .
<Sync time="197.540"/>
given that , the uh
<Sync time="199.145"/>
the way the healthcare works essentially is based on a pool . that is , when one person's costs go up ,
<Sync time="204.630"/>
in order for them to be properly covered ,
<Sync time="206.655"/>
other people's costs also have to go up .
<Sync time="208.950"/>
on an individual level ,
<Sync time="210.240"/>
this really doesn't make that big of a difference .
<Sync time="212.285"/>
on a larger societal level , when we are undergoing something like an obesity epidemic ,
<Sync time="217.385"/>
that has a really significant impact on healthcare costs .
<Sync time="220.425"/>
and , in fact ,
<Sync time="221.230"/>
the united states now is one of the most uh
<Sync time="223.895"/>
expensive pla-
<Sync time="224.980"/>
uh places to get healthcare in the world ,
<Sync time="227.040"/>
and a large factor in that
<Sync time="228.815"/>
is just the general unhealthiness of this country .
<Sync time="232.105"/>
i think that it is justified to engage in uh tactics there's explicitly designed to improve the healthiness of individuals within this country
<Sync time="240.520"/>
when there are broader externalities on other people ,
<Sync time="243.720"/>
people that have to pay more for health care
<Sync time="245.665"/>
because of um
<Sync time="247.315"/>
other people's uh , you know , health .
<Sync time="249.900"/>
given that ,
<Sync time="250.500"/>
proud to propose .
<Sync time="251.762"/>
