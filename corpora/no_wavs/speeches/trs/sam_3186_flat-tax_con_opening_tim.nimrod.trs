i stand in
<Sync time="2.270"/>
firm opposition to the motion ,
<Sync time="4.370"/>
we should introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="6.760"/>
i'm going to break this spa-
<Sync time="8.840"/>
speech into three parts :
<Sync time="10.480"/>
firsts , i'm going to discuss the morality of a flat , versus progressive tax ,
<Sync time="14.550"/>
then discuss why progressive taxation is the most utile way to do it ,
<Sync time="18.625"/>
and then thirdly , discuss why customisation is key when it comes to taxes .
<Sync time="23.070"/>
first off on morals .
<Sync time="25.270"/>
while tim may claim that the wealthy have
<Sync time="27.850"/>
the only claim to their property , and the government has no right to take that money away ,
<Sync time="32.650"/>
we would fundamentally disagree .
<Sync time="34.600"/>
first we don't think a strong link between individuals humanity ,
<Sync time="38.245"/>
and the property that they control , was actually created .
<Sync time="41.480"/>
instead , we think government action
<Sync time="43.460"/>
and taxes by extension
<Sync time="45.050"/>
are simply about utility , and that
<Sync time="47.200"/>
taking property away from individuals
<Sync time="49.260"/>
is a tradition , that has
<Sync time="50.735"/>
existed throughout history , and is again
<Sync time="53.630"/>
fundamental to the construction of any functioning government ,
<Sync time="56.845"/>
and is
<Sync time="57.340"/>
always essential
<Sync time="58.420"/>
to helping the most marginalized within
<Sync time="60.440"/>
a particular community .
<Sync time="61.900"/>

<Sync time="62.940"/>
additionally , we would say that the wealthiest got their power on the backs of the poor .
<Sync time="67.760"/>
individuals who are still making a large amount of money
<Sync time="70.550"/>
employ , typically , huge amounts of poor workers ,
<Sync time="73.935"/>
and depend
<Sync time="74.845"/>
on poor and middle class individuals
<Sync time="77.035"/>
to buy their goods ,
<Sync time="78.530"/>

<Sync time="79.470"/>
therein creates a reciprocal obligation
<Sync time="81.930"/>
to pa- pay back the suffering people , who you have
<Sync time="84.755"/>
uh manipulated
<Sync time="86.720"/>
and profited from .
<Sync time="89.240"/>
additionally , individuals who got their money
<Sync time="91.880"/>
uh from a historical fund , who
<Sync time="94.740"/>
uh whose family has had money going back ,
<Sync time="97.530"/>
typically made their money by stealing , or further oppressing marginalized peoples ,
<Sync time="102.235"/>
and pushing people into poverty .
<Sync time="104.140"/>
it is unclear
<Sync time="105.290"/>
why donald trump , coming from a millionaire family ,
<Sync time="108.170"/>
deserves uh
<Sync time="109.360"/>
all this money ,
<Sync time="110.610"/>
when it
<Sync time="111.010"/>
came on the back of poor individuals , who were pushed out of society ,
<Sync time="114.985"/>
and were
<Sync time="115.595"/>
essentially
<Sync time="116.405"/>
uh pushed into the cycle of poverty ,
<Sync time="118.750"/>
in order to push their family up .
<Sync time="121.370"/>
additionally though ,
<Sync time="122.475"/>
we would say that the claim to property has nothing to do with humanity ,
<Sync time="125.845"/>
is based on ,
<Sync time="126.610"/>
instead on utility .
<Sync time="128.185"/>
the reason we don't take everyone's property away , the reason we don't steal people's goods , or
<Sync time="132.570"/>
take their homes away , and
<Sync time="133.770"/>
redistribute them evenly , is because we believe
<Sync time="136.315"/>
that it would lead to less utile
<Sync time="138.300"/>
outcomes .
<Sync time="140.130"/>
if it were possible to evenly distribute all goods , in all situations , and then still have a functioning and profitable society , still have
<Sync time="147.585"/>
good foreign direct investment ,
<Sync time="149.210"/>
we would do so . it's simply that
<Sync time="151.530"/>
this is the most effective , and uh
<Sync time="154.150"/>
and pragmatic way to actually do taxes .
<Sync time="157.820"/>
finally , we would say that the rich
<Sync time="159.960"/>
actually use tax money
<Sync time="161.270"/>
the most . just look at the owner of walmart ,
<Sync time="163.560"/>
the average employee is on-
<Sync time="166.070"/>
uh is on food stamps .
<Sync time="168.260"/>
they-
<Sync time="168.905"/>
a proportion of their living wage comes from the sort of tax revenue , and as such the rich use it to push themselves in power .
<Sync time="175.225"/>
they also use roads the most , because they have the most transportation uses , they ship goods ,
<Sync time="179.465"/>
and largely uh
<Sync time="181.160"/>
use- uh
<Sync time="183.170"/>
get the benefit of some of the most effective school systems ,
<Sync time="186.320"/>
through the- the money that they pay .
<Sync time="188.940"/>
now , going to my substantive material .
<Sync time="190.810"/>
we believe progressive taxes are the most utile ,
<Sync time="193.340"/>
because the poorest people have the greatest marginal value of a dollar .
<Sync time="196.580"/>
this also extends to the marginal value of a percentage of their income .
<Sync time="200.220"/>
if a rich person loses ten percent of their income ,
<Sync time="202.480"/>
they can't buy more caviar ,
<Sync time="204.110"/>
or more fancy food ,
<Sync time="205.630"/>
when a poor person loses a huge percentage of their income ,
<Sync time="208.220"/>
they cannot survive , they cannot buy food , shelter ,
<Sync time="211.120"/>
or basic living conditions . they can't pay for internet transportation , which is essential for many jobs in twenty first century .
<Sync time="217.260"/>
at the point where people will starve , through a flat tax , it is unjust .
<Sync time="220.960"/>
now the second point of substantive material ,
<Sync time="223.185"/>
is that customization is key .
<Sync time="225.030"/>
as tim says , the role of government is to incentivize particular action ,
<Sync time="228.530"/>
and to maximize utility .
<Sync time="230.205"/>
the ability to have a progressive ,
<Sync time="232.300"/>
and somewhat complicated tax system ,
<Sync time="234.160"/>
allows the government
<Sync time="235.290"/>
to disincentivize particular action ,
<Sync time="237.590"/>
or otherwise levy uh
<Sync time="239.245"/>
fees on individuals
<Sync time="240.915"/>
who benefit the most from taxes ,
<Sync time="243.700"/>
which as we said ,
<Sync time="244.590"/>
where the wealthiest people . as such  ,
<Sync time="247.020"/>
we believe
<Sync time="247.760"/>
that we should not introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="251.640"/>
