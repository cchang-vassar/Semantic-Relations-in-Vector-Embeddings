the motion for today's debate is : this house would subsidize biofuels .
<Sync time="5.585"/>
this house , being the united states government .
<Sync time="8.005"/>
two many areas of clash , the first on the importance of government subsidization .
<Sync time="12.220"/>
we tell you that new technology is incredibly expensive ,
<Sync time="15.410"/>
and es-
<Sync time="16.330"/>
on both an individual and corporate level .
<Sync time="19.050"/>
what this means is that , in order to make a system change ,
<Sync time="21.950"/>
especially a system as ingrained in oil and gas running cars , as the american economy ,
<Sync time="26.650"/>
there needs to be an outside impetus that shows corporations that there is an investment ,
<Sync time="30.950"/>
and shows individuals that they can still save money in the long term .
<Sync time="34.530"/>
let's explore these two layers separately .
<Sync time="37.035"/>
recognize that on a corporate level ,
<Sync time="38.930"/>
corporations are generally risk averse .
<Sync time="41.030"/>
what this means is that , they do not pour money
<Sync time="43.150"/>
into things that they do not feel will bring back money to the corporation .
<Sync time="47.020"/>
we tell you that , corporations recognize america's dependency on oil ,
<Sync time="50.760"/>
recognize that they themselves cannot permeate the market ,
<Sync time="53.260"/>
and thus do not put money into innovating
<Sync time="55.790"/>
new kinds of biofuels , or new kinds of biofuel running cars .
<Sync time="59.820"/>
subsidizing the-
<Sync time="62.015"/>
subsidizing biofuels would also create a market for them .
<Sync time="65.940"/>
what this means is now , on an individual level ,
<Sync time="68.620"/>
people will feel like biofuel running cars
<Sync time="71.290"/>
are worth the long term investment ,
<Sync time="73.350"/>
because recognize that , with new technology , it's likely that that car is going to be more expensive than
<Sync time="77.915"/>
the car they currently drive .
<Sync time="79.385"/>
in order to justify giving in money for this new item ,
<Sync time="82.440"/>
they also have to justify that , in the long term , it will be cheaper .
<Sync time="86.090"/>
this is the same rationale we use when people buy a car that is
<Sync time="89.050"/>
more expensive , but they expect to last for longer .
<Sync time="91.965"/>
they know that , even though they're showing more money out in the short term ,
<Sync time="94.970"/>
in the long term ,
<Sync time="96.110"/>
they will end up paying less .
<Sync time="98.160"/>
we tell you that , the development of a market ,
<Sync time="100.300"/>
by means of the consumer ,
<Sync time="101.720"/>
signals to corporations that they can invest more freely , and pump out
<Sync time="105.530"/>
new ideas , and new innovations .
<Sync time="108.140"/>
this brings us to our second area of cl- clash ,
<Sync time="110.150"/>

<Sync time="110.490"/>
which has to do with the harms of the oil and gas industry .
<Sync time="113.610"/>
because the- the-
<Sync time="114.440"/>
besides the obvious
<Sync time="116.370"/>
environmental impacts of
<Sync time="117.990"/>
upping the amount of greenhouse gases , that cause global warming ,
<Sync time="121.580"/>
and pollute our environment ,
<Sync time="123.200"/>
there's also an economic dependency cost .
<Sync time="125.920"/>
recognize that , the majority of
<Sync time="128.385"/>
powers , that holds the monopoly over oil and gas ,
<Sync time="131.890"/>
are middle eastern and non western .
<Sync time="134.095"/>
what this means is that a country such as the united states
<Sync time="137.250"/>
have massive dependencies on middle eastern countries ,
<Sync time="140.090"/>
that cause them-
<Sync time="140.960"/>
their economies to be dependent on how those function .
<Sync time="143.860"/>
what this means is that , if in a given year ,
<Sync time="146.160"/>
the middle eastern country cannot produce enough oil , or decides to
<Sync time="149.630"/>
raise the price in order to manipulate the market ,
<Sync time="152.190"/>
the american economy goes with it .
<Sync time="154.860"/>
this is very problematic ,
<Sync time="156.240"/>
insofar as the whim of one of the leaders of these gas or oil industries
<Sync time="160.300"/>
can stop the america- uh
<Sync time="161.930"/>
stop up america's highways for days .
<Sync time="164.825"/>
but there's a second layer to this .
<Sync time="166.880"/>
we tell you one of the massive reasons that america doesn't sanction saudi arabia , but is willing to sanction other countries , such as israel ,
<Sync time="173.760"/>
is because they are not afraid-
<Sync time="175.330"/>
they're more afraid of saudi arabia , and the control they have over the american economy , in the form of oil .
<Sync time="180.840"/>
we tell you that , if america is able to produce its own fuels ,
<Sync time="184.130"/>
and is unafraid of the manipulation of its economy , that saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries can cause ,
<Sync time="189.655"/>
they are more likely to step up in situations of human rights abuses .
<Sync time="194.040"/>
more than in this though , we tell you
<Sync time="196.005"/>
that subsidizing biofuels encourages innovation .
<Sync time="199.320"/>
this is good on two levels : first , we can get benefits to the domestic economy ,
<Sync time="202.960"/>
but it also helps in the global economy .
<Sync time="205.150"/>
first , on the domestic economy .
<Sync time="206.970"/>
we tell you that , showing that a market exists
<Sync time="209.435"/>
and investing in that market 
<Sync time="211.220"/>
signals to corporations that it's time to innovate in this sphere , in order to make
<Sync time="215.065"/>
more money .
<Sync time="216.060"/>
what this means is that ,
<Sync time="217.270"/>
more bio- different kinds of biofuels ,
<Sync time="219.600"/>
different kinds of biofuel running cars ,
<Sync time="221.615"/>
are more likely to be developed on our side of the house ,
<Sync time="224.460"/>
insofar as they know that they can actually sell their products .
<Sync time="227.510"/>
but recognize what this does on a global market as well .
<Sync time="230.710"/>
if america is able to become one of the main global players
<Sync time="233.870"/>
in
<Sync time="234.290"/>
developing their own bio fuel , and bio fuel technology ,
<Sync time="237.415"/>
they're able to sell this to other global powers .
<Sync time="240.290"/>
given that this is a
<Sync time="241.380"/>
newly developing market , and a few other countries have gotten very far ,
<Sync time="245.300"/>
we tell you that becoming one of the first
<Sync time="247.460"/>
allows america to build their own
<Sync time="249.665"/>
niche market
<Sync time="250.725"/>
in the global economy .
<Sync time="252.140"/>
for these reasons , proud to propose .
<Sync time="254.255"/>

<Sync time="255.820"/>
