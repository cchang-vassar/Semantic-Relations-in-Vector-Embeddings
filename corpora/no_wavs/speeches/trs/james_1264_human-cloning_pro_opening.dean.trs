we should ban human cloning .
<Sync time="3.730"/>
so
<Sync time="4.225"/>
by this we mean that
<Sync time="5.460"/>
all nations around the world
<Sync time="7.370"/>
should forbid human cloning
<Sync time="9.370"/>
for any purpose . we're not going to make a distinction between so-called therapeutic and reproductive cloning
<Sync time="15.260"/>
in this debate .
<Sync time="16.110"/>
we think that any cloning of a human being
<Sync time="18.810"/>
ought be illegal
<Sync time="19.735"/>
in every country around the world .
<Sync time="21.880"/>
so ,
<Sync time="22.475"/>
two arguments for why we think this is the case .
<Sync time="25.370"/>
the first is that we think that it would be deeply unethical to clone another human being because of the effect it would have on the clone
<Sync time="32.290"/>
once produced .
<Sync time="33.690"/>
imagine the person that you create when you clone a human being .
<Sync time="38.280"/>
you create a person who has
<Sync time="40.025"/>
no mother , no father .
<Sync time="42.040"/>
someone who has no family , no place where they belong in society ,
<Sync time="46.450"/>
presumably they're going to be raised
<Sync time="48.215"/>
by the state
<Sync time="49.610"/>
or by these scientists who have treated them .
<Sync time="52.620"/>
so we think it's
<Sync time="53.575"/>
very very improbable that this person
<Sync time="55.900"/>
will ever have
<Sync time="56.970"/>
a happy , fulfilling ,
<Sync time="58.360"/>
normal life .
<Sync time="60.210"/>
ordinarily , society goes to great lengths to facilitate children having happy ,
<Sync time="65.335"/>
normal lives so that they can go on to become
<Sync time="67.715"/>
productive citizens . we see that
<Sync time="69.835"/>
uh the state spends a great deal of money facilitating adoptions to loving homes for instance ,
<Sync time="74.755"/>
and a great deal of money removing children from unhappy homes .
<Sync time="78.355"/>
so what happens when you have
<Sync time="80.450"/>
this cloned child who belongs to say ,
<Sync time="83.120"/>
i don't know , the university of michigan
<Sync time="86.070"/>
um who is being raised by a team of scientists ,
<Sync time="89.230"/>
who presumably
<Sync time="90.325"/>
does not receive the same kind of nurturing and love that a child
<Sync time="93.650"/>
being raised elsewhere would .
<Sync time="95.410"/>
you're creating someone who , in the best case ,
<Sync time="98.260"/>
lives in some version of foster care
<Sync time="100.565"/>
and in the worst case is treated like a lab rat .
<Sync time="103.610"/>
we think that this is
<Sync time="104.705"/>
deeply troubling and completely unfair .
<Sync time="107.220"/>
this clone child
<Sync time="108.525"/>
is no less deserving
<Sync time="110.245"/>
of an ordinary , happy life than any other human being . they're
<Sync time="113.670"/>
a human , they have a soul like anyone else ,
<Sync time="116.110"/>
but we think it's improbable that they will ever be provided
<Sync time="118.875"/>
with these opportunities .
<Sync time="121.220"/>
we also tell you that it's deeply troubling that you give
<Sync time="125.145"/>
private corporations or universities the ability to
<Sync time="129.155"/>
effectively create people for their own ends . we think that once you allow cloning , it's likely that
<Sync time="134.290"/>
companies are going to
<Sync time="135.860"/>
clone people with certain traits
<Sync time="138.180"/>
in order to examine their genome . say , you'll have
<Sync time="141.160"/>
people created for a very specific research purpose . we think that this is likely to lead those people to have
<Sync time="147.105"/>
severe psychological issues once they're old enough to understand that they were effectively
<Sync time="151.850"/>
created
<Sync time="152.725"/>
like a lab rat who's bread to have brown fur .
<Sync time="155.900"/>
we don't think that it's acceptable to put anyone , particularly an innocent child ,
<Sync time="160.145"/>
into this situation .
<Sync time="161.670"/>
so we ought ban cloning
<Sync time="163.090"/>
because it is clearly not in the interest of these
<Sync time="165.625"/>
hypothetical , cloned children .
<Sync time="168.235"/>

<Sync time="169.120"/>
our second argument is about the legal difficulties
<Sync time="172.630"/>
behind
<Sync time="173.330"/>
permitting human cloning .
<Sync time="175.810"/>
ordinarily ,
<Sync time="176.835"/>
a child's uh next of kin have a certain legal obligation to that child .
<Sync time="181.820"/>
in some countries it might only be the parents , in other countries this obligation might extend
<Sync time="186.070"/>
past the parents to other close relatives ,
<Sync time="189.060"/>
but we see that no one has a legal obligation to the clone .
<Sync time="192.335"/>
at least that's
<Sync time="193.320"/>
what it seems to me since they don't have a mother or father the way that another person would .
<Sync time="197.990"/>
so does ,
<Sync time="198.620"/>
to use my earlier example , the university of michigan
<Sync time="201.370"/>
have an obligation to feed and clothe this child ?
<Sync time="204.390"/>
we think that
<Sync time="205.145"/>
it's very impersonal to assert that that's the case ,
<Sync time="208.120"/>
and we think that it's very like that you would end up with cloned children who don't have
<Sync time="211.865"/>
clear legal guardians that they would follow in the guardianship of the state , which is obviously something that we want to avoid
<Sync time="217.510"/>
because of both the expense to the public
<Sync time="219.655"/>
and also the way that it affects the child .
<Sync time="222.185"/>

<Sync time="222.935"/>
but i also think it's troubling in terms of the relationship of the cloned child to the cell donor because recognize ,
<Sync time="229.295"/>
you know if someone was making
<Sync time="230.530"/>
clone of a person , maybe they would take
<Sync time="232.345"/>
one of my skin cells and
<Sync time="234.375"/>
grow it into a new clone .
<Sync time="236.005"/>
what is the clone's relationship to me at that point ? we think that
<Sync time="239.930"/>
this is very unclear and that there's no satisfactory uh
<Sync time="242.670"/>
resolution to this . do i have the same obligation as a father or do i have no obligation ?
<Sync time="248.160"/>
because it is unfair to the clone first of all and secondarily because of legal difficulties ,
<Sync time="252.750"/>
we should ban human cloning .
<Sync time="254.530"/>
thank you .
