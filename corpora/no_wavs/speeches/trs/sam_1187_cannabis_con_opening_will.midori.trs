<Sync time="0.640"/>
i stand in firm opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.810"/>
cannabis should be legalized .
<Sync time="5.900"/>
i have two arguments for why cannabis should not be legalized , but first i have
<Sync time="10.920"/>
a few overviews to address some of will's arguments .
<Sync time="14.680"/>
first {oss/off} on crime and dessert .
<Sync time="17.600"/>
when individuals commit a crime
<Sync time="19.530"/>
they are taking an action against society .
<Sync time="21.930"/>
we've elected politicians , we have voted in favor of laws
<Sync time="25.410"/>
which say that the consumption of cannabis
<Sync time="27.690"/>
ought to be illegal . because
<Sync time="29.925"/>
%hes the good and rights are idiosyncratic and determined by the society in which actions are taking place ,
<Sync time="36.350"/>
when individuals
<Sync time="37.530"/>
take actions in opposition to the rules of law
<Sync time="40.980"/>
they are essentially saying that your interpretation of the good is fundamentally incorrect . that they ought be outside the law
<Sync time="47.105"/>
when it is
<Sync time="47.975"/>
best for them .
<Sync time="49.950"/>
we think that individuals who have
<Sync time="51.870"/>
harms
<Sync time="52.490"/>
against them
<Sync time="53.270"/>
after breaking the law
<Sync time="54.890"/>
uh do not deserve additional protections from government . we would say
<Sync time="57.870"/>
that if illegal guns were
<Sync time="59.860"/>
on average more dangerous than legal guns ,
<Sync time="62.610"/>
there'd be no reason that the government should expand gun access to individuals
<Sync time="66.285"/>
who
<Sync time="66.795"/>
would otherwise be prevented from buying a legal gun .
<Sync time="69.380"/>
we think that once individuals have consented to the harms of a legal action 
<Sync time="73.490"/>
by ignoring the rule of law
<Sync time="74.865"/>
they ought get what is coming to them .
<Sync time="76.745"/>
secondly , i want to say about the
<Sync time="79.620"/>
idea of oppression and racism .
<Sync time="81.740"/>
cops will always find a reason to oppress black bodies , oppressed black individuals ,
<Sync time="85.880"/>
just look to philando castile . he
<Sync time="88.065"/>
literally followed
<Sync time="89.660"/>
the uh
<Sync time="90.645"/>
instructions of the cop to the letter .
<Sync time="93.140"/>
he said
<Sync time="94.135"/>
exactly what he needed to , he admitted he had a gun in the car ,
<Sync time="97.580"/>
as gun rights activists say you ought to do when dealing with a cop , and he was shot 
<Sync time="102.150"/>
until he was dead .
<Sync time="104.490"/>
what this means is that
<Sync time="106.040"/>
the problem of racism is not a problem of any individual policy . it must be solved through
<Sync time="111.220"/>
overall broad societal change and a fundamental restructuring of the police system .
<Sync time="116.000"/>
allowing cannabis will not solve this . we see this in states like oregon , washington ,
<Sync time="121.320"/>
uh and alaska .
<Sync time="123.250"/>
they these states have already had investigations by the department of justice but continue to be racist
<Sync time="128.680"/>
as it is essentially a symptom of the police system .
<Sync time="133.820"/>
legalizing pot ,
<Sync time="134.770"/>
legalizing cannabis , will not solve this .
<Sync time="137.140"/>
two arguments for why legalizing cannabis is a bad idea .
<Sync time="139.810"/>
first off , on in- international implications .
<Sync time="142.160"/>
the united states has pushed its
<Sync time="144.110"/>
ideas and pushed its policy on the world r- at large .
<Sync time="147.400"/>
states have adopted strong anti-drug policies as a result of the united states influence .
<Sync time="152.855"/>
and now it has been pushed into
<Sync time="155.125"/>
the rule of law in those states and been determined to be the societal good 
<Sync time="159.075"/>
as i discussed in my overview .
<Sync time="161.235"/>
what this means is that if the united states abandons this policy , abandons the states which itself has pushed to a-
<Sync time="167.090"/>
adopt certain policies , then these states will be m-
<Sync time="170.080"/>
massively harmed . these states depend on united states support ,
<Sync time="173.490"/>
both philosophically and in a lot of cases financially ,
<Sync time="176.535"/>
to stop the
<Sync time="177.885"/>
usage of drugs and the united states
<Sync time="180.060"/>
abanding them abandoning them now
<Sync time="182.200"/>
would be fundamentally unjust .
<Sync time="184.600"/>
on cartels , i would like to discuss the idea that cartels will shift to another option , another product ,
<Sync time="189.850"/>
if we legalize uh
<Sync time="191.235"/>
coke er excuse me not cocaine
<Sync time="192.990"/>
um cannabis .
<Sync time="194.670"/>
they could le-
<Sync time="195.710"/>
they could
<Sync time="196.435"/>
start to sell hard drugs more often , move to things like human trafficking ,
<Sync time="200.340"/>
both of these are terrible options that are far more likely
<Sync time="203.820"/>
if the cartel has no other option . the cartel has huge infrastructure put in place to
<Sync time="208.685"/>
uh
<Sync time="209.405"/>
smuggle goods into the united states
<Sync time="211.600"/>
and will continue
<Sync time="212.830"/>
these paths
<Sync time="213.830"/>
even if cannabis is legalized . as such we should allow them to continue selling cannabis
<Sync time="218.560"/>
rather than shifting to a more problematic product .
<Sync time="221.100"/>
the second argument is about efficiency and happiness .
<Sync time="223.600"/>
autonomy is threatened by cannabis . when individual smoke
<Sync time="226.375"/>
their motivation goes down ,
<Sync time="228.220"/>
typically their memory is harmed ,
<Sync time="230.470"/>
this is huge externalities as it can harm the people around you .
<Sync time="233.660"/>
driving under the influence can make it more likely that you'll kill someone ,
<Sync time="236.700"/>
but additionally we believe we can regulate internetna-
<Sync time="239.030"/>
or individual action .
<Sync time="240.710"/>
when individuals are told they must wear a helmet or face fines , that is us saying
<Sync time="244.610"/>
that
<Sync time="245.010"/>
profoundly illogical individual actions
<Sync time="247.770"/>
sh- ought be regulated by government . we think it is both
<Sync time="250.090"/>
philosophically consistent and essential that government
<Sync time="253.180"/>
legislate this sort of action and as such
<Sync time="255.310"/>
cannabis should not be legalized .
<Sync time="258.399"/>
