we should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp .
<Sync time="3.910"/>
so we have two main arguments they we're gonna make in this debate .
<Sync time="6.440"/>
the first is about the usefulness of guantanamo bay
<Sync time="9.065"/>
and the second is about the problems that arise
<Sync time="11.680"/>
if we were to take this type of action ,
<Sync time="13.410"/>
and why these two things combined outweigh any sort of argument
<Sync time="16.500"/>
in favor of
<Sync time="17.965"/>
uh the protections of people within guantanamo bay .
<Sync time="20.240"/>
so firstly , on usefulness . so
<Sync time="22.350"/>
many people complain that
<Sync time="24.245"/>
this type of detention center goes against international law ,
<Sync time="27.460"/>
goes against united states laws , about
<Sync time="29.590"/>
procedural law ,
<Sync time="30.970"/>
right to trial , right to a trial by peers , all these types of things ,
<Sync time="34.500"/>
and so we're gonna deal with those arguments first
<Sync time="36.615"/>
about why we think the usefulness exists
<Sync time="38.705"/>
and why these laws don't apply . so
<Sync time="40.750"/>
on laws in the united states - firstly it's clearly the case that as these are not u_s citizens they don't have the same
<Sync time="46.560"/>
rights embodied within the constitution not applied to them . these are rights that
<Sync time="50.425"/>
are only guaranteed to u_s citizens and therefore those arguments
<Sync time="53.570"/>
don't really come into play in this debate . but more importantly on international law - 
<Sync time="57.400"/>
recognize that the state
<Sync time="58.720"/>
first has an obligation
<Sync time="60.340"/>
to its citizens .
<Sync time="61.760"/>
while international law and treaties that
<Sync time="64.445"/>
uh the treaties that compose international law
<Sync time="66.760"/>
are just and are useful
<Sync time="68.805"/>
in things such as war and international cooperation ,
<Sync time="71.660"/>
the state has a foremost obligation to protect its citizens
<Sync time="75.340"/>
and in keeping people in guantanamo bay , these are people that are overwhelmingly dangerous actors
<Sync time="80.115"/>
who ,
<Sync time="80.755"/>
let's recognize ,
<Sync time="81.850"/>
you're dealing primarily with extremists who aren't going to respect the laws of war that are governing
<Sync time="87.015"/>
how we are ou- how we ought to treat them .
<Sync time="89.460"/>
if these individuals aren't willing to reciprocate the obligations of those treaties , if they aren't willing to reciprocate those obligations
<Sync time="96.265"/>
and the norms of international law ,
<Sync time="98.310"/>
we think they are willing a world
<Sync time="99.950"/>
in which those same rights are not given to them .
<Sync time="102.900"/>
because of this we think that any argument that's made about international law
<Sync time="107.020"/>
making guantanamo bay
<Sync time="108.520"/>
a bad center , something that
<Sync time="110.260"/>
uh unjustly restricts the rights of these individuals , we think they have
<Sync time="113.610"/>
created that world through their extremist actions
<Sync time="116.355"/>
and because of that
<Sync time="117.350"/>
are not deserving of these rights . we
<Sync time="119.580"/>
it also recognized as useful
<Sync time="121.800"/>
simply in the fact that it allows for the containment
<Sync time="123.900"/>
very dangerous people .
<Sync time="125.590"/>
even if not ,
<Sync time="126.450"/>
even if there isn't obvious legal evidence because
<Sync time="128.965"/>
legal procedure and the proceedings that prove guilt in a court %hes aren't always
<Sync time="133.630"/>
available to show that these people are guilty ,
<Sync time="136.020"/>
there's often overwhelming evidence against these people
<Sync time="138.690"/>
in other regards .
<Sync time="139.830"/>
and even if it is the case that these people are not always the guilty individuals that we believe they are ,
<Sync time="145.115"/>
given the fact that these people , when they are guilty , are likely individuals that are going to carry out
<Sync time="150.030"/>
incredibly damaging and
<Sync time="151.580"/>
incredibly violent acts , we think it is the obligation of the united states to take the risk
<Sync time="156.090"/>
to contain these individuals .
<Sync time="157.700"/>
so secondly
<Sync time="158.555"/>
we wanna talk about the problems with release . so what do we think would happen
<Sync time="161.995"/>
if we were to take this ?
<Sync time="162.950"/>
so ,
<Sync time="163.450"/>
most of the people that are in guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="166.080"/>
as i just pointed out ,
<Sync time="167.420"/>
are incredibly dangerous . which means
<Sync time="169.255"/>
if you would have a trial
<Sync time="170.600"/>
in public ,
<Sync time="171.390"/>
that trial would become an
<Sync time="172.675"/>
incredibly obvious target for violence . we think that extremists
<Sync time="176.300"/>
and other terrorist organizations
<Sync time="178.120"/>
would rally around that
<Sync time="179.340"/>
individual event
<Sync time="180.360"/>
to make some sort of statement . to show
<Sync time="183.075"/>
the
<Sync time="183.495"/>
the flaws in the legal system in the united states , to create some sort of propaganda moment ,
<Sync time="187.795"/>
we think that this 
<Sync time="188.860"/>
is an incredibly obvious target and we think it would likely
<Sync time="191.945"/>
inv- involve
<Sync time="192.945"/>
individuals who are innocent , people that are citizens of the state , being hurt .
<Sync time="196.860"/>
secondly , most prisons simply
<Sync time="198.740"/>
don't want to have these targets . they can't ensure the safety of these people when they are in prisons because of the
<Sync time="204.595"/>
high profile nature of them
<Sync time="206.425"/>
as criminals , as extremists . we think they're likely
<Sync time="208.980"/>
to have violence put against them
<Sync time="210.940"/>
within jail and we think that st- uh
<Sync time="213.065"/>
prisons simply don't want to take them .
<Sync time="214.670"/>
and finally
<Sync time="215.395"/>
there's an obvious harm of returning them to their home country .
<Sync time="218.400"/>
if you release them , if you let them go back
<Sync time="220.420"/>
to their home countries , it allows them to go back to the activities
<Sync time="223.350"/>
that led to them being in guantanamo in the first place .
<Sync time="225.960"/>
we think that this
<Sync time="226.785"/>
ensures that there are more extremists in the world that are likely
<Sync time="229.980"/>
to take damaging acts ,
<Sync time="231.370"/>
violent acts against united states' citizens .
<Sync time="233.640"/>
the job of the united states government is first and foremost to protect its citizens
<Sync time="237.620"/>
and we believe that guantanamo bay
<Sync time="239.540"/>
does a better job of that
<Sync time="241.030"/>
if it were not to exist . for these reasons
<Sync time="243.650"/>
we should not cl- we should not close
<Sync time="245.770"/>
the guantanamo bay
<Sync time="247.010"/>
detention camp .
<Sync time="248.245"/>
