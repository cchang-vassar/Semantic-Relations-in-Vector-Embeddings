i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban anonymous posts .
<Sync time="5.175"/>
um the enforcement mechanism will basically be to just shut down websites that allow anonymous posting .
<Sync time="11.430"/>
um so
<Sync time="12.390"/>
you know presumably most sites associated with large firms will obviously just comply with this .
<Sync time="17.635"/>
you know
<Sync time="18.440"/>
sites like twitter for example that allow just sort of like egg accounts
<Sync time="22.350"/>
or youtube which can allow for anonymous commenting .
<Sync time="25.275"/>
um we would say that this always has to be associated with like an actual person
<Sync time="29.370"/>
and we were just outright shut down sites that are completely predicated upon anonymous posting
<Sync time="34.345"/>
so like yik yak and things like that .
<Sync time="37.660"/>
two independent points . first is that
<Sync time="40.000"/>
anonymous posting allows for more
<Sync time="42.600"/>
vitriolic online
<Sync time="44.000"/>
discourse and that this is inherently problematic .
<Sync time="47.730"/>
i think there's really two ways in which this breaks down .
<Sync time="50.650"/>
so
<Sync time="51.235"/>
broadly
<Sync time="52.460"/>
what happens here is that because people are able to hide behind an anonymous shield and they're not
<Sync time="57.720"/>
you know particularly accountable for whatever it is that they say ,
<Sync time="61.570"/>
they're more likely to say things that are deliberately inflammatory or deliberately offensive
<Sync time="66.435"/>
um either
<Sync time="67.370"/>
just because they think they can get away with it and they genuinely hold those views
<Sync time="70.960"/>
or because they're just trying to be inflammatory and just trying to get a rise out of somebody .
<Sync time="76.450"/>
so then the two ways really that we see this breaking down and causing harm is
<Sync time="79.995"/>
first is the personal harms that
<Sync time="81.795"/>
people are more likely to target individuals and
<Sync time="84.950"/>
uh you know actually harass them online .
<Sync time="87.400"/>
so i think one particularly good example of this
<Sync time="89.870"/>
is um
<Sync time="90.890"/>
the way that leslie jones was harassed on twitter
<Sync time="93.880"/>
uh you know having rachel
<Sync time="95.375"/>
racial epitaphs slurred at her and misogynists epitaphs .
<Sync time="98.915"/>
so
<Sync time="99.505"/>
this type of harassment is directly facilitated by anonymous commenting
<Sync time="103.710"/>
because people don't have to remain um accountable for what it is that they're saying
<Sync time="108.210"/>
but secondly , there's the discursive harm that
<Sync time="110.255"/>
broadly online discourse becomes more vitriolic ,
<Sync time="113.740"/>
becomes were confrontational ,
<Sync time="115.800"/>
uh because there is this norm set around the internet that people are just going to be more aggressive when they're behind an anonymous shield .
<Sync time="122.815"/>

<Sync time="123.335"/>
we think that to an extent this still happens even when you're not personally face to face with the individual
<Sync time="128.680"/>
but it is
<Sync time="129.290"/>
significantly and even exponentially more problematic when there is
<Sync time="133.155"/>
no way for there to be any sort of accountability for these types of actions .
<Sync time="137.500"/>
because the discourse shifts to be more vitriolic on the internet
<Sync time="140.560"/>
when there's that anonymous component ,
<Sync time="142.450"/>
we think there's a more long lasting effect on our societal discourse patterns
<Sync time="146.810"/>
um in that we are you know more likely to be {combatitive/combative} with one another
<Sync time="150.890"/>
in that we are
<Sync time="151.765"/>
you more likely to
<Sync time="153.495"/>
uh see others as yo- the enemy and
<Sync time="155.745"/>
less willing to you know
<Sync time="157.130"/>
rationalize with another because of just sort of the way that
<Sync time="160.230"/>
online commenting has shaped the way that our society talks with one another .
<Sync time="164.600"/>
the second independent point that i'd like to advance is a general lack of accountability for actions .
<Sync time="169.870"/>
so just beyond sort of the ways in which this affects how we talk to one another
<Sync time="174.210"/>
there's also the broader issue of accountability .
<Sync time="177.360"/>
first ,
<Sync time="178.035"/>
i think this is something that just principled issue that
<Sync time="181.010"/>
um when we speak
<Sync time="182.590"/>
um we should be accountable for the things that we say .
<Sync time="185.505"/>
we want
<Sync time="186.300"/>
um
<Sync time="186.810"/>
individual you know
<Sync time="187.940"/>
sentences and sentiments to be
<Sync time="190.180"/>
tied to an individual
<Sync time="191.970"/>
because we only care about things being expressed in the first place because there is an individual behind that sentiment .
<Sync time="199.010"/>
we think that when
<Sync time="200.270"/>
sentiments just kind of come out of the ether because they're voiced by anonymous trolls or whatever
<Sync time="205.000"/>
that's a problem , because that means that there
<Sync time="207.500"/>
really significant portions of our societal discourse that don't have an actual source , that don't stem from an individual person .
<Sync time="214.385"/>
but we also think that that lack of
<Sync time="216.955"/>
uh you know connection to an individual person is harmful for law enforcement reasons . that
<Sync time="221.425"/>
anonymity on the internet has you know
<Sync time="223.570"/>
made it very difficult to enforce things like say hate crime laws
<Sync time="227.140"/>
because you can essentially target people anonymously .
<Sync time="230.300"/>
um you
<Sync time="231.455"/>
are
<Sync time="231.995"/>
less accountable from a legal perspective
<Sync time="234.870"/>
to answer for your actions
<Sync time="236.665"/>
and to answer for the the harm you have placed on society by encouraging this type of discourse
<Sync time="242.005"/>
and by incurring these types of harms on people . proud to propose .
<Sync time="246.779"/>
