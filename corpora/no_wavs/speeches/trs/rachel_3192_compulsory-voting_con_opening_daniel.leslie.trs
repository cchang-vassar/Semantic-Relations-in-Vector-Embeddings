<Sync time="0.655"/>
every time we have a debate about compulsory voting ,
<Sync time="3.920"/>
the qu- the question is always :
<Sync time="5.685"/>
do we care about the quantity of the votes that come in
<Sync time="8.650"/>
or do we care about the quality
<Sync time="10.350"/>
and w- the thought that people put behind those votes ?
<Sync time="13.380"/>
this is the central question in this round because , in the end , you can mandate for people to come to the voting booth ,
<Sync time="18.390"/>
but you cannot mandate for them to spend hours researching the candidate
<Sync time="21.860"/>
or to make sure that they know what they're talking about .
<Sync time="24.150"/>
in the end ,
<Sync time="24.925"/>
those who didn't have time before are unlikely to have time now , and so what you're actually creating is a world in which hundreds of people
<Sync time="31.600"/>
come in ,
<Sync time="32.250"/>
throw a random name into the ballot box , and leave .
<Sync time="35.400"/>
two main areas of clash , the first on why it is unjust to mandate compulsorily compulsory voting .
<Sync time="41.250"/>
if it is a right to vote ,
<Sync time="42.450"/>
it should also be a right not to .
<Sync time="44.330"/>
this is because a central tenet of democracy
<Sync time="46.690"/>
is the freedom of an individual to be autonomous and live life as they desire .
<Sync time="50.740"/>
as such , it might be preferable if everyone voted ,
<Sync time="53.940"/>
but it is undemocratic to force everyone to vote .
<Sync time="57.080"/>
moreover ,
<Sync time="58.270"/>
we think that it is wrong to make something a legal requirement
<Sync time="61.170"/>
which we know will
<Sync time="62.060"/>
unevenly discriminate among the population .
<Sync time="64.580"/>
in the same way that there's massive opposition
<Sync time="66.955"/>
to stop and frisk policies because they are used in a racist and biased way ,
<Sync time="71.110"/>
we think that requiring compulsory voting is the same thing .
<Sync time="74.360"/>
insofar as lowest voter turnout occurs
<Sync time="76.530"/>
mostly among those in poverty
<Sync time="78.215"/>
and very often among people of color , who have been forced into poverty by society ,
<Sync time="82.265"/>
we think that when you then say , " if you don't show up , we're going to fine you , even though we stuck you in the same situation , "
<Sync time="87.465"/>
is completely unjustified and actively discriminatory .
<Sync time="90.785"/>
we also want to talk about political speech ,
<Sync time="93.650"/>
because we think that not casting your vote
<Sync time="95.920"/>
is often a political statement in itself .
<Sync time="98.240"/>
if turnout is low ,
<Sync time="99.250"/>
it indicates that none of the candidates were preferable , that they weren't engaging , and that they didn't engage the pro- the like democratic process .
<Sync time="106.125"/>
it's then a political statement in itself
<Sync time="108.315"/>
to say that ,
<Sync time="109.150"/>
" look ,
<Sync time="109.730"/>
i'm not voting because there isn't a good option for me , because i don't think they're representative of my views . "
<Sync time="116.090"/>
insofar as this is , in its way , a p-
<Sync time="118.320"/>
like an act of political speech ,
<Sync time="120.010"/>
like a statement of saying , " i do not believe in either of these candidates , "
<Sync time="123.380"/>
we think it also ought be protected as such .
<Sync time="125.980"/>

<Sync time="126.585"/>
we think that this is then legitimate , even if not all of them are being political .
<Sync time="130.480"/>
as we see ,
<Sync time="131.360"/>
like people are protected in wearing political clothing ,
<Sync time="133.990"/>
although not everyone is making a statement by spouting a big large gun on the front of their shirt
<Sync time="138.405"/>
or naked women .
<Sync time="139.960"/>
our second area of clash is about being pragmatically problematic .
<Sync time="143.820"/>
we don't think ,
<Sync time="144.585"/>
as danny thinks , that you're actually going to change the incentives of politicians ,
<Sync time="148.830"/>
because in the end ,
<Sync time="149.780"/>
those who are going to be voting more now
<Sync time="151.850"/>
are those who are lower down in society and don't have as much money .
<Sync time="155.090"/>
this means larger politicians do not care about them and honestly would still provo- prefer
<Sync time="159.655"/>
for them to have a difficult time getting to the vote ,
<Sync time="161.750"/>
because who cares if they get fined ,
<Sync time="163.580"/>
they just don't want them voting against them .
<Sync time="165.630"/>
so ,
<Sync time="167.135"/>
a- at the point that they're like not actually creating a meaningful base for politicians ,
<Sync time="171.770"/>
all you're actually creating on their side of the house
<Sync time="174.400"/>
is a world in which you're going to have a lot more attack ads and a lot more flash campaigning ,
<Sync time="178.690"/>
because now they're going to be directly advertising to people who don't have much time to research .
<Sync time="183.500"/>
so a lot more of
<Sync time="184.940"/>
he sh- he said see- she said , look how p- much prettier i am than my candidate .
<Sync time="189.070"/>
like we think that a lot of the time candidates like trump
<Sync time="191.565"/>
grow because people just only see the social media presence
<Sync time="194.655"/>
rather than doing the research with regards to their politics ,
<Sync time="197.435"/>
and i think that's actually what you're creating .
<Sync time="199.330"/>
because their side of the house
<Sync time="200.760"/>
doesn't actually create time bubbles where
<Sync time="202.755"/>
single mothers can suddenly
<Sync time="204.400"/>
spend time researching political candidates ,
<Sync time="206.870"/>
rather just says , " go and do it , "
<Sync time="209.500"/>
you're much more likely to have decisions that are based on snippets .
<Sync time="212.710"/>
we also think that
<Sync time="214.440"/>
fines for those who don't go in
<Sync time="216.060"/>
further disengage them from the political process and create a financial strain .
<Sync time="219.900"/>
basically it's saying : you're already struggling ,
<Sync time="222.320"/>
let me as like the proxy government
<Sync time="224.660"/>
make you struggle even more .
<Sync time="226.715"/>
this is the best way for them to say , " i don't care about this government . not only is it not representing me ,
<Sync time="231.555"/>
but it is actively harming me and forcing me into uncomfortable situations that take away from my life ."
<Sync time="236.685"/>
but at the end of the day , the candidate is still not going to be representative ,
<Sync time="241.280"/>
even with compulsory voting , because people aren't truly voting for who they believe in .
<Sync time="245.160"/>
they're just trying to get out of it .
<Sync time="246.760"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="249.890"/>
