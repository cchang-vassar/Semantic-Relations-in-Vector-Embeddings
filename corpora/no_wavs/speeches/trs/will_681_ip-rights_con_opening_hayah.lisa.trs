<Sync time="1.415"/>
i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.660"/>
that intermath-
<Sync time="4.320"/>
intellectual property rights should be abolished .
<Sync time="7.020"/>
i have three independent points .
<Sync time="8.450"/>
first , that it reduces the incentive to create  .
<Sync time="11.170"/>
second , that principally we deserve the products of our own labor and thirdly ,
<Sync time="15.695"/>
that international competition will likely punish countries
<Sync time="18.820"/>
that do this to an extreme extent .
<Sync time="20.870"/>
so
<Sync time="21.555"/>
on the first argument that it reduces the incentive to create , i think this is
<Sync time="24.810"/>
hinted at in gov's arguments where they
<Sync time="26.930"/>
are like ah well you know some people say this .
<Sync time="29.345"/>
i think people say that for a pretty good reason
<Sync time="31.420"/>
right ? like
<Sync time="32.070"/>
we're recognize it like if you are
<Sync time="33.845"/>
a person producing medicine , like if you are a pharmaceutical company ,
<Sync time="36.970"/>
you just don't have an incentive to create that medicine
<Sync time="39.490"/>
because you're investing billions of dollars into it and then as soon as you
<Sync time="43.240"/>
like actually put this thing on the market
<Sync time="45.080"/>
someone's going to release a knock off of it ,
<Sync time="47.360"/>
like steal up like half of your market share possibly more
<Sync time="50.885"/>
and you're the one that has to burden the entire cost of production in the first place .
<Sync time="54.650"/>
so you literally don't make enough money to make up for the initial expenditures
<Sync time="58.430"/>
that allowed you to engage in the production of this
<Sync time="60.330"/>
medicine .
<Sync time="61.210"/>
that's really important because when they talk about patent trolls or price gouging or anything like that ,
<Sync time="65.990"/>
that is a
<Sync time="66.840"/>
like the terminal harm of that . one hundred percent of the time
<Sync time="69.760"/>
is just not accessing the medicine
<Sync time="71.440"/>
but that doesn't happen
<Sync time="72.550"/>
always right ? there are instances in where we avoid these realities where the products are able to reach consumers in a reasonable way .
<Sync time="78.810"/>
the comparative then , where the products just
<Sync time="81.325"/>
don't get
<Sync time="82.160"/>
produced in the first place ,
<Sync time="84.050"/>
that means that
<Sync time="85.350"/>
by definition you are always going to have less access to these life saving drugs . you are always going to have less access to
<Sync time="91.005"/>
any product that is protected by intellectual property rights that is systemically important to the existence of
<Sync time="96.780"/>
to our society .
<Sync time="98.660"/>
given that i think the worst case scenario is always realized on their side of the house
<Sync time="102.895"/>
because the actual
<Sync time="104.210"/>
fundamental incentives of a corporation to make money are violated by the passage of this motion
<Sync time="109.475"/>
and as a result
<Sync time="110.460"/>
you just lose your infrastructure necessary to create these things .
<Sync time="114.070"/>
my second independent argument is that principally people should just have intellectual property rights because they created these things .
<Sync time="119.650"/>
on government they try to tell you
<Sync time="120.895"/>
oh well you know things like music for example are like the composite of like long long kinds of history in like work that came before it .
<Sync time="127.830"/>
i think there's a couple problems with
<Sync time="129.200"/>
this .
<Sync time="129.585"/>
first is that
<Sync time="130.540"/>
the way we combine things is in itself unique right ? like i pick up a rock and i pick up some water and i make some cool thing out of the combination of those two things ,
<Sync time="137.930"/>
that is a meaningfully new thing
<Sync time="139.880"/>
and i put in labor and i used my ingenuity to create that new thing .
<Sync time="143.360"/>
so it is ri-
<Sync time="144.240"/>
worth recognizing that this isn't
<Sync time="145.830"/>
the property of the people that might have created the rock or the water or whatever ,
<Sync time="149.510"/>
this is my thing because i made this unique item and i actually put in meaningful input that changed the landscape .
<Sync time="155.305"/>
so
<Sync time="155.710"/>
combination is something that is deserving of a
<Sync time="158.000"/>
of an ownership claim
<Sync time="159.205"/>
but also recognize that the most blatant examples of this , like say sampling for example in music ,
<Sync time="164.480"/>
do require you to
<Sync time="165.940"/>
actually pay money to the person that initially created the things . like a lot of the time the way we combine things
<Sync time="170.560"/>
requires payments to those who came before us .
<Sync time="172.725"/>
so i think the status quo is perfectly capable of solving for the harms that are described by side government
<Sync time="176.870"/>
right ?
<Sync time="177.365"/>
but on an even more fundamental level , i just deserve my own work .
<Sync time="181.390"/>
i put a thing into it like i actually utilized my own labor and time and resources and money or whatever
<Sync time="187.885"/>
and that means that i actually am entitled
<Sync time="190.750"/>
to the existence of this to the ownership over this thing that i created .
<Sync time="194.690"/>
that this is mine .
<Sync time="196.300"/>
a- at the most fundamental level our autonomy is contingent on the idea that we actually maintain ownership over our own things , over our own creations , because that is
<Sync time="203.575"/>
what allows us to act reasonably within this world . how we
<Sync time="207.280"/>
our ownership of a property is literally how we maintain agency because we are able to protect ourselves with our property .
<Sync time="213.875"/>
the last argument i'd like to advance then
<Sync time="216.190"/>
is international competition . i think this is unclear by the model whether or not
<Sync time="219.420"/>
international competition is a thing because like
<Sync time="221.735"/>
it's unclear if just one country is doing this but recognize that if just one country is doing this this is a
<Sync time="226.620"/>
terrible idea
<Sync time="228.150"/>
because your products are no longer protected but everybody else's is . so you're at a massive market disincentive .
<Sync time="232.875"/>
i think this just destroy your economy in so far as you have no capacity to compete in the international market
<Sync time="238.175"/>
and as a result
<Sync time="239.270"/>
all this ingenuity
<Sync time="240.370"/>
all the things that matter so deeply to side government just go out the window once you don't have this protection in your own labor force in your own prote- in your own production capacity . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="249.430"/>
