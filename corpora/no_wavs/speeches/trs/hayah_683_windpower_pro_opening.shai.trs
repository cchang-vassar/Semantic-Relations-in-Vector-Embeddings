<Sync time="0.665"/>
it would be difficult for most people around the world today
<Sync time="4.120"/>
to imagine living without electricity .
<Sync time="6.820"/>
lights , heat ,
<Sync time="8.225"/>
washing machines , dryers , dishwashers , computers , phones ,
<Sync time="12.070"/>
and that's just personal use .
<Sync time="13.860"/>
that isn't even looking at it the large scale ,
<Sync time="16.115"/>
such as manufacturing plants and other
<Sync time="18.330"/>
industries .
<Sync time="19.390"/>
and the number of people with access to electricity is growing and that's great .
<Sync time="23.650"/>
except where does it come from ?
<Sync time="25.430"/>
and what is the cost we are paying for it today ?
<Sync time="28.330"/>
and what is the cost that we could be paying for it in the future ?
<Sync time="31.650"/>
that's what this motion is about .
<Sync time="33.570"/>
what we think , ladies and gentlemen , on the side of the government , is that we should incentivize research production and use of wind power
<Sync time="40.460"/>
through subsidies and cr- tax credits .
<Sync time="42.720"/>

<Sync time="43.440"/>
we're going to discuss three main aspects :
<Sync time="45.760"/>
first we wanna discuss the dependency that we have on fossil fuels , and the dangers that lie there in ,
<Sync time="50.615"/>
we're gonna discuss the advantages of wind power
<Sync time="53.215"/>
and whether or not the government has a duty to invest in effective clean and and
<Sync time="57.230"/>
and ef-
<Sync time="57.820"/>
effective in clean energy solutions .
<Sync time="59.810"/>
so let's look at the first issue , which is the dependency that we have today
<Sync time="63.430"/>
on fossil fuels .
<Sync time="64.950"/>
um we think that there are three main dangers and
<Sync time="67.290"/>
risks involved here :
<Sync time="68.720"/>
first , we have the health risks to people .
<Sync time="71.140"/>
there is pollution ,
<Sync time="72.415"/>
that is
<Sync time="73.225"/>
growing amounts of pollution around the world
<Sync time="75.610"/>
from uh fr-
<Sync time="76.670"/>
from from all the use of electricity that we have ,
<Sync time="79.705"/>
and it is damaging our health
<Sync time="81.940"/>
ladies and gentlemen , that is the first and
<Sync time="84.165"/>
perhaps the most important , or at least the most
<Sync time="86.295"/>
selfish thing that we can think about
<Sync time="88.200"/>
and perhaps will spur us to change .
<Sync time="91.720"/>
we also have the health risk involved with the collection of fossil fuels . we think that when
<Sync time="95.585"/>
people have to uh
<Sync time="96.780"/>
deal with oil rigs for example , that's the kind of
<Sync time="99.730"/>
an industry that presents a very
<Sync time="101.975"/>
uh high risk to its workers .
<Sync time="104.005"/>
and then of course with the environmental risks which is again the pollution , but here we have to look more towards the long term and what's happening
<Sync time="110.040"/>
to our environment , and what kind of
<Sync time="111.850"/>
world are we leaving to our children , right ? we see that wildlife is
<Sync time="115.370"/>
um is being affected by pollution , we see the ozone layer is thinning , we see that global warming is a problem that we need to look to .
<Sync time="121.345"/>
and then of course there's the issue of the dangers of dependency on the fossil fuels and why is it so dangerous that we're just depended
<Sync time="127.820"/>
on one specific type of fuel ?
<Sync time="130.160"/>
um first of all , because we're dependent on countries that control
<Sync time="133.450"/>
these
<Sync time="133.950"/>
resources and we think that it's dangerous when your
<Sync time="136.555"/>
entire energy consumption
<Sync time="139.310"/>
relies on
<Sync time="140.955"/>
their prices and their willingness to sell .
<Sync time="144.810"/>
we also think that it's dangerous to be dependent on a finite resource and that's why we need to look to something that is not finite .
<Sync time="151.235"/>
that there won't , that won't end up just disappearing
<Sync time="154.320"/>
whether it's a hundred years from now
<Sync time="155.905"/>
or five hundred years from now or five thousand years from now ,
<Sync time="159.290"/>
we still need to make sure that we can be uh
<Sync time="161.270"/>
indepen- that we we are independent and not dependent on a finite resource .
<Sync time="165.020"/>
so let's look at wind power and what are the advantages of wind power .
<Sync time="167.860"/>

<Sync time="168.730"/>
we realize that it's not a magical solution ,
<Sync time="170.875"/>
but it is a large part of a solution .
<Sync time="173.150"/>
we think that it
<Sync time="173.815"/>
greatly complements other types of clean energy , and here's why it's so great : first of all , you can use it on both the small scale and large scale .
<Sync time="180.660"/>
that means that you can have wind farms ,
<Sync time="182.645"/>
you can have large tracts of land that are currently not being used for anything or being used for wildlife
<Sync time="188.210"/>
um
<Sync time="188.685"/>
for for agricultural purposes , but can be shared
<Sync time="191.695"/>
with um with wind farms ,
<Sync time="193.990"/>
and we think that
<Sync time="195.405"/>
that that's great for for larger solutions , but we also think that we can encourage people
<Sync time="199.825"/>
to privately invest in wind
<Sync time="202.220"/>
technology . we think that we can encourage people ,
<Sync time="204.600"/>
where applicable , to to install for example
<Sync time="207.260"/>
small scale
<Sync time="208.320"/>
wind turbines
<Sync time="209.590"/>
uh in their houses in order to make it
<Sync time="211.880"/>
small scale as well and make sure that people are utilizing
<Sync time="214.555"/>
wind
<Sync time="215.280"/>
a- to as much as we can .
<Sync time="217.800"/>
we think that offshore wind farms are an option and we think that that
<Sync time="221.500"/>
solves a lot of problems that we have today in terms of land and space and
<Sync time="225.385"/>
whether people wanna be living near them .
<Sync time="227.290"/>
we think it's a safe technology and that's also an important thing to remember .
<Sync time="230.885"/>
so does the government have a duty to invest in these clean technologies ? we think absolutely . they must protect the health of their citizens , they must look out for the future and they must make sure that we are not dependent on a finite resource that is going to run out .
