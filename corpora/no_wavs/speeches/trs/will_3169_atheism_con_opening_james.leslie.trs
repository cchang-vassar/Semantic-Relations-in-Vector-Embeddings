i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should adopt atheism .
<Sync time="4.910"/>
two independent points :
<Sync time="7.195"/>
the first is that
<Sync time="8.900"/>
a reasonable alternative
<Sync time="10.980"/>
to like wholehearted belief exists ,
<Sync time="13.880"/>
and that's agnosticism .
<Sync time="15.680"/>
reasonably speaking , this is what we should adopt
<Sync time="18.000"/>
instead . so ,
<Sync time="19.610"/>
gov talks you pretty extensively about how
<Sync time="22.540"/>
if there is no affirmative proof for something ,
<Sync time="25.100"/>
we should
<Sync time="25.860"/>
actively disbelieve in it . that is , we should reject it .
<Sync time="29.415"/>
i think this is a problem though ,
<Sync time="31.380"/>
because generally speaking , when we say there is sort of insufficient data or insufficient evidence on something ,
<Sync time="37.455"/>
we don't just say , " well , the case is settled .
<Sync time="40.230"/>
it doesn't exist . "
<Sync time="41.500"/>
i think what we have in the status quo
<Sync time="43.695"/>
is no proof one way or another
<Sync time="46.110"/>
about whether or not god exists , or any deity , for that matter .
<Sync time="50.670"/>
so , i think this is a problem ,
<Sync time="52.480"/>
because there is a possibility of a deity ,
<Sync time="55.110"/>
right ? things like
<Sync time="56.050"/>
the inexplicable nature of the big bang
<Sync time="58.720"/>
open up a lot of questions as to what causes these things .
<Sync time="62.180"/>
regardless of scientific advances ,
<Sync time="64.290"/>
there are always openings in our understanding of the known universe and of time and of all these large questions that are fundamentally unanswerable from our perspective
<Sync time="73.970"/>
that deities
<Sync time="74.970"/>
could always have a role in it .
<Sync time="76.765"/>
so i think it is not particularly prudent then to outright reject even the possibility
<Sync time="82.200"/>
of some sort of deity .
<Sync time="84.170"/>
recognize also that science is often reversed .
<Sync time="87.210"/>
we are living in a period
<Sync time="88.750"/>
of unprecedented scientific discovery ,
<Sync time="91.665"/>
but that begs the question then of the fact
<Sync time="94.140"/>
that we
<Sync time="94.945"/>
always seem to reject , or at least always assume , that that large amount of discovery is inherently warranted .
<Sync time="102.210"/>
scientific discoveries , though , are often discredited hundreds of years after they're made .
<Sync time="107.040"/>
and in recent memory ,
<Sync time="108.890"/>
we have made most of the major scientific discoveries of the modern age .
<Sync time="113.410"/>
this is a problem
<Sync time="114.570"/>
because these things can be reversed .
<Sync time="116.830"/>
the things that gov considers like inherent proof that we just cannot assume a deity exists
<Sync time="122.470"/>
might be reversed in the long term ,
<Sync time="124.765"/>
and i think that that in and of itself is a reason to be agnostic .
<Sync time="128.540"/>

<Sync time="129.120"/>
our second independent point is that religion ,
<Sync time="131.500"/>
as an institution ,
<Sync time="132.930"/>
is something that just makes the world a better place .
<Sync time="135.820"/>
so even if you put aside all of these things about like whether or not is
<Sync time="139.280"/>
it rational ,
<Sync time="140.240"/>
we think that just being an atheist makes the world a little worse .
<Sync time="143.870"/>
a couple reasons for this :
<Sync time="145.540"/>
the first is that the afterlife is something that res-
<Sync time="148.800"/>
relieves suffering
<Sync time="150.190"/>
for those who are currently experiencing the most suffering in the moral world .
<Sync time="154.460"/>
so ,
<Sync time="155.015"/>
people who are , for example , starving in the streets of like
<Sync time="158.445"/>
bolivia ,
<Sync time="159.560"/>
which is like largely like christian country , i believe ,
<Sync time="162.770"/>
um i-
<Sync time="163.540"/>
like can it least to some extent be relieved by the notion that
<Sync time="167.605"/>
one day
<Sync time="168.735"/>
they are going to this afterlife , to this heaven , because they were pious individuals , because they did nothing wrong ,
<Sync time="175.040"/>
and as a result of that ,
<Sync time="177.145"/>
they will get to experience eternal happiness .
<Sync time="180.170"/>
it doesn't matter if this is true ,
<Sync time="182.305"/>
because it gives them peace at mind while they have their suffering in this world .
<Sync time="187.360"/>
that's important .
<Sync time="188.435"/>
because the reality is that
<Sync time="190.415"/>
even if suffering is non-unique ,
<Sync time="192.410"/>
even if they're going to starve on either side of the house ,
<Sync time="195.560"/>
the the reassurance in their mind , that happiness that is generated by the thought that they will experience an afterlife ,
<Sync time="202.370"/>
has tangible value .
<Sync time="204.470"/>
being happy is a good thing .
<Sync time="207.010"/>
so i think we will defend belief systems
<Sync time="209.585"/>
that allow people to be happy
<Sync time="212.430"/>
but secondly , we would say that uh
<Sync time="214.630"/>
hell , specifically ,
<Sync time="216.350"/>
inspires levels of charity in people .
<Sync time="218.905"/>
people that genuinely believe that if they do bad things , they will be
<Sync time="222.730"/>
punished
<Sync time="223.540"/>
are less likely to do the bad thing .
<Sync time="226.660"/>
obviously , there are people for whom this incentive structure doesn't particularly affect them .
<Sync time="231.440"/>
obviously , those people exist on the margins .
<Sync time="233.930"/>
we would say that if there is anyone who is disincentivized from wrongdoing because they fear punishment ,
<Sync time="239.530"/>
that's a good thing . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="242.492"/>
