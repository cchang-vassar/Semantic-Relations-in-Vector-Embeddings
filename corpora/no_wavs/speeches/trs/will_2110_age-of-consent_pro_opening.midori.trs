i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should lower the age of consent .
<Sync time="4.980"/>
with regards to the model
<Sync time="7.040"/>
i think generally speaking , across countries
<Sync time="10.250"/>
there are variations in what the exact age of consent is .
<Sync time="13.760"/>
for the sake of this debate , i will assume that the age of consent is generally around eighteen but there is obviously some degree of fluctuation .
<Sync time="21.830"/>
that said , that fluctuation
<Sync time="23.720"/>
probably doesn't matter terribly much ,
<Sync time="25.730"/>
because the fluctuation is largely a product of social conventions
<Sync time="29.605"/>
that will determine %hes how a child is treated
<Sync time="32.530"/>
in their early age .
<Sync time="34.180"/>
and generally speaking , those
<Sync time="36.525"/>
distinct
<Sync time="37.665"/>
ages should reflect the way the society t- treats children
<Sync time="41.950"/>
such that they will generally be ready by that
<Sync time="44.210"/>
age .
<Sync time="45.040"/>
that said , i think
<Sync time="46.600"/>
three in- two independent points that
<Sync time="48.350"/>
demonstrate why there are structural reasons
<Sync time="51.205"/>
that
<Sync time="51.995"/>
d-
<Sync time="52.400"/>
ages of consent
<Sync time="53.390"/>
are set too high .
<Sync time="55.830"/>
so
<Sync time="56.695"/>
the first independent point is that
<Sync time="58.985"/>
the structural reasons
<Sync time="60.700"/>
prevent consensual relationships .
<Sync time="63.280"/>
so
<Sync time="64.200"/>
generally speaking ,
<Sync time="65.705"/>
the capacity to engage in a consensual relationship
<Sync time="68.830"/>
exists at a fairly early age .
<Sync time="71.100"/>
this is for a couple reasons , i think one is that modern media has evolved in such a way
<Sync time="76.230"/>
that has allowed children to
<Sync time="78.700"/>
or not children but has allowed
<Sync time="80.650"/>
like younger individuals
<Sync time="82.300"/>
to understand the complexities of sexual interaction at a
<Sync time="86.325"/>
comparatively earlier age than it
<Sync time="88.420"/>
was
<Sync time="89.345"/>
previously the case .
<Sync time="91.270"/>
and i think then the structural problem becomes that
<Sync time="94.570"/>
age of consent laws have not adapted to this changing culture . that despite the fact that people are generally
<Sync time="100.730"/>
under generally have an understanding of what sexual interaction constitutes and what the risks are
<Sync time="106.735"/>
at a much earlier age than they used to .
<Sync time="109.040"/>
we still have not changed those age laws and as a result they are higher than they ought be .
<Sync time="114.205"/>

<Sync time="115.020"/>
but secondly
<Sync time="116.040"/>
i think it's important to recognize the
<Sync time="117.820"/>
harms that are that originate from when these laws are
<Sync time="122.580"/>
when these aged limits are too high .
<Sync time="124.920"/>
so sexual expression is something that is
<Sync time="126.985"/>
key to an individual's identity .
<Sync time="129.200"/>
i think it is almost intuitively true that it's something people care a lot about
<Sync time="133.635"/>
but it's also something that shapes a lot of our decision making .
<Sync time="136.840"/>
that
<Sync time="137.200"/>
people care deeply enough about this that they are willing to make really significant sacrifices for sexual interaction . and i think that's a significant point ,
<Sync time="145.750"/>
because generally whether or not someone is
<Sync time="148.345"/>
valuing an individual
<Sync time="150.890"/>
end as something that they
<Sync time="153.045"/>
care very deeply about ,
<Sync time="154.770"/>
that's pretty much our best proxy for whether or not it's key to their identity .
<Sync time="158.670"/>
that
<Sync time="158.975"/>
based on their capacity to engage in sexual relationships ,
<Sync time="162.760"/>
they shape perceptions of their self worth ,
<Sync time="165.640"/>
they shape
<Sync time="166.515"/>
their priorities of what they're going to do with their life .
<Sync time="169.800"/>
this is something that's really significant to an individual and i think depriving them of the capacity to capitalize upon that aspect of their identity 
<Sync time="177.195"/>
is something that generates significant harm .
<Sync time="179.630"/>
but secondly i just want to point out that these laws are often ineffective at
<Sync time="183.840"/>
doing what they are designed to do .
<Sync time="185.405"/>
i think the reason that we have age of consent laws in the first place
<Sync time="189.085"/>
is that b-
<Sync time="189.720"/>
we recognize that at a very young age 
<Sync time="192.940"/>
people do not understand the %hes
<Sync time="195.520"/>
ramifications of 
<Sync time="198.450"/>
of sex . but i think i've demonstrated
<Sync time="201.160"/>
why generally speaking we have
<Sync time="203.990"/>
ages that are too
<Sync time="205.210"/>
high in terms of the bright line of when
<Sync time="208.015"/>
we should allow them to consent into this .
<Sync time="210.145"/>
i think the other reason though why these laws exist
<Sync time="212.800"/>
is that there are power asymmetries intrinsic between relationships between extremely young individuals
<Sync time="217.660"/>
and comparatively older individuals .
<Sync time="220.085"/>
i think the problem though is that having an age of consent
<Sync time="223.070"/>
doesn't do a particularly good job of preventing these %hes
<Sync time="225.975"/>
relationships that have distinct power dynamics .
<Sync time="228.810"/>
and the reason for this is something that's actually quite similar to why pedophilia
<Sync time="232.945"/>
existed within the catholic church . that
<Sync time="234.960"/>
when there is that power dynamic ,
<Sync time="236.850"/>
a cover up ,
<Sync time="237.810"/>
getting the victim to not really speak up ,
<Sync time="240.460"/>
is quite easy .
<Sync time="241.690"/>
so i think that having that age of consent
<Sync time="244.080"/>
doesn't actually do very much to ensure that the person will be punished and
<Sync time="247.560"/>
doesn't do very much to disincentive those problematic relationships .
<Sync time="251.145"/>
as a result ,
<Sync time="252.115"/>
the laws don't do what they're meant to do . proud to propose .
<Sync time="255.449"/>
