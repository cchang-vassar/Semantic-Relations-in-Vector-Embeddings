don't ban fraternities . 
<Sync time="2.650"/>
three main areas of clash :
<Sync time="3.960"/>
first i want to talk about how a lot of the problems that will attributed to fraternities
<Sync time="8.030"/>
aren't actually endemic to them , and will continue even worse if you ban fraternities .
<Sync time="12.900"/>
recognize that the reasons that all of these issues are present at frat parties
<Sync time="16.320"/>
is because frat parties have become the dominant party supplier .
<Sync time="19.770"/>
the only other get-togethers tend to be more personal invite only kind of situations ,
<Sync time="24.265"/>
where necessarily the fact that you have less strangers and less people willing to report
<Sync time="28.350"/>
etcetera
<Sync time="29.100"/>
means there's going to be less sexual assault and less binge drinking 
<Sync time="32.100"/>
etcetera .
<Sync time="33.080"/>
these issues however , sexual assaults , over drinking , all of that
<Sync time="36.470"/>
are endemic to party culture not necessarily to
<Sync time="39.140"/>
frats .
<Sync time="39.805"/>
as long as students demand parties all they do is displace these same harms
<Sync time="43.880"/>
onto
<Sync time="44.350"/>
smaller dis institutionalized parties .
<Sync time="47.150"/>
the only solution for these kinds of situations is basically what colleges have already been employing
<Sync time="51.900"/>
which are heavy education campaigns
<Sync time="53.790"/>
that advocate for consent , bystander training ,
<Sync time="56.575"/>
like all of these things
<Sync time="58.110"/>
that actually change the mindsets of individual people
<Sync time="61.540"/>
rather than just saying : " look , because we've banned this one institution
<Sync time="64.800"/>
everything is solved " .
<Sync time="65.930"/>
we think the problem on their side of the house is that they're creating a false sense of solvency ,
<Sync time="69.995"/>
in which people think the issue is gone because frats are now banned ,
<Sync time="74.210"/>
when in reality it remains
<Sync time="75.970"/>
just as there and just as pertinent as ever .
<Sync time="79.350"/>
we think currently when you have an institution
<Sync time="81.345"/>
you can watch , regulate and target them
<Sync time="83.515"/>
much easier .
<Sync time="84.680"/>
you can warn people specifically about frat parties and how you can take care of yourself there .
<Sync time="88.920"/>
you can offer them
<Sync time="90.020"/>
perks for calling
<Sync time="91.110"/>
ubers and specify trainings that are targeted towards them .
<Sync time="94.400"/>
we prefer a centralized system
<Sync time="96.250"/>
because it's reliable and easy to regulate .
<Sync time="98.640"/>
insofar as schools are just infinitely like going to be watching frats a lot closer than other people ,
<Sync time="103.430"/>
we think that they're going to be more capable of decreasing the harmful effects
<Sync time="107.110"/>
than if all of those same parties just became
<Sync time="109.830"/>
like , just became in different locations with different groups of individuals that they're not used to observing .
<Sync time="115.555"/>
but our second area of clash is how it becomes more pernicious .
<Sync time="118.850"/>
yes , it's bad that frats are exclusionary and providing social networking
<Sync time="122.580"/>
only to those who can afford it ,
<Sync time="124.030"/>
but rich people will always find a way to separate themselves through other means .
<Sync time="127.870"/>
recognize things like the finals clubs at harvard
<Sync time="130.320"/>
are literally just a response to the fact that frats and things like that
<Sync time="133.820"/>
were told to desegregate and be more inclusive
<Sync time="136.390"/>
and then they were like : " ha , guess what , we're just gonna create finals clubs that are institutionalized with all of your best donors
<Sync time="141.680"/>
so that we can get away with this " .
<Sync time="143.510"/>
we think that these situations are even worse , because now they don't need university support to exist .
<Sync time="148.350"/>
they essentially divested themselves from university infrastructure ,
<Sync time="151.340"/>
rely on massive donors that the university doesn't want to piss off either ,
<Sync time="154.910"/>
and it means that you can't actually have any sort of meaningful changing in terms of social norms or requiring better treatment or requiring bystander training .
<Sync time="161.870"/>
we prefer frats because they're under over cert-
<Sync time="164.495"/>
uh university oversight .
<Sync time="166.140"/>
there is some level of influence there .
<Sync time="169.120"/>
you can actually force some rules like party logging and making sure you know where all the parties are . things like that .
<Sync time="174.150"/>

<Sync time="174.690"/>
our third area of clash is just why fraternities can be incredibly helpful and thus people ought be able to choose them .
<Sync time="180.310"/>
recognize that college is incredibly difficult , especially when you are first transitioning your freshman year .
<Sync time="185.640"/>
frats provide a meaningful community that help people through hard times .
<Sync time="189.210"/>
and recognize that there's no objective way in which we adjust or
<Sync time="193.120"/>
go through this difficult time in our life . like there's no one way to go to college and make it .
<Sync time="198.110"/>
rather , every individual finds their own community and group of people ,
<Sync time="201.930"/>
maybe they don't find anyone at all ,
<Sync time="203.610"/>
that helps them through
<Sync time="204.545"/>
an incredibly difficult transitory period .
<Sync time="206.810"/>
some people use school clubs ,
<Sync time="208.380"/>
others use frats . but both of these are equally valid options
<Sync time="212.090"/>
and something the provides with a supportive community
<Sync time="214.555"/>
in times of need .
<Sync time="215.890"/>
we think that everyone deserves that and we don't think that it's the job of universities to regulate it
<Sync time="220.420"/>
insofar as it takes those options
<Sync time="222.120"/>
away from students .
<Sync time="223.990"/>
we also just think that like having somewhere where like maybe there is an institutional history of like your parents knew them ,
<Sync time="229.690"/>
like there's more oversight .
<Sync time="230.940"/>
it is really helpful for individuals who are away from home for the first time for a long period of time .
<Sync time="235.930"/>
um
<Sync time="236.645"/>
and also like insofar as they have to get their social networking
<Sync time="239.720"/>
somewhere , were unsure why any of these harms are unique . for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="244.879"/>
