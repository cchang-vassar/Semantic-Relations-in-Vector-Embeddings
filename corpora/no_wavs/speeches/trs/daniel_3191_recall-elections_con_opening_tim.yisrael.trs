we should not introduce recall elections because recall elections are only going to make politics more ef-
<Sync time="6.150"/>
inefficient
<Sync time="7.150"/>
less effective and ultimately therefore less accountable to the actual or less representative of the actual will of the people .
<Sync time="13.550"/>
so first let's start by saying that uh
<Sync time="16.460"/>
in extreme circumstances of misconduct or uh um
<Sync time="19.730"/>
if there is extreme wrongdoing
<Sync time="22.110"/>
um
<Sync time="22.675"/>
you usually have alternative mechanisms anyway .
<Sync time="26.125"/>
you can have
<Sync time="26.860"/>
impeachment .
<Sync time="27.860"/>
you can take actual charges against someone so if someone is gu-
<Sync time="31.180"/>
if a political figure is guilty of corruption or uh misdemeanor or some other kind of misconduct
<Sync time="36.970"/>
there's alternates you can take if they actually do severe action .
<Sync time="41.040"/>
usually recall elections just happen because they do something you don't like and they do it on a sufficient enough scale that you really don't like it
<Sync time="48.330"/>
or you do it because you can get away with it and it mucks up someone's agenda .
<Sync time="52.500"/>
so let's break down what this will look like .
<Sync time="54.890"/>
generally when you win an election
<Sync time="56.850"/>
um with the majority of the people you have a mandate to enact your agenda because the people have spoken and the people want something so you should give it to them .
<Sync time="64.790"/>
because that's the way democracy is supposed to work .
<Sync time="67.290"/>
the way democracy isn't supposed to work is that uh
<Sync time="70.005"/>
if somebody uh wins the majority of a
<Sync time="72.215"/>
election or the like ,
<Sync time="74.730"/>
now obviously an opposition can and should keep fighting
<Sync time="77.990"/>
but one thing that they shouldn't do is that
<Sync time="80.235"/>
uh when you keep trying to trigger a recall election
<Sync time="84.020"/>
what you're likely going to do is
<Sync time="86.370"/>
um make it so that it's um
<Sync time="88.580"/>
not actually focusing on the issues uh
<Sync time="91.050"/>
as much as you're focusing on the uh
<Sync time="92.770"/>
continued reelection of somebody .
<Sync time="94.910"/>
so you're not actually really going to let someone who was de- uh
<Sync time="97.560"/>
democratically elected uh
<Sync time="99.450"/>
enact their agenda
<Sync time="100.630"/>
because it becomes rather difficult to do things when you're running for election
<Sync time="104.340"/>
oftentimes .
<Sync time="105.040"/>
but additionally i also think that recall elections are less representative
<Sync time="109.370"/>
because when you have like a major election you tend to get more turn out people plan for it people can uh
<Sync time="115.345"/>
it's easier to get time off from work maybe .
<Sync time="117.480"/>
you're more aware of it because it comes at similar times on uh
<Sync time="120.680"/>
predetermined intervals .
<Sync time="122.345"/>
but a special elections tend to have lower turnout which means that you're likely going to get a less representative result
<Sync time="127.890"/>
anyway uh
<Sync time="128.890"/>
which isn't really all that fair and that's very bad .
<Sync time="130.955"/>
uh and most likely the results aren't going to change all that much and even if the results do change
<Sync time="137.120"/>
then what you've done is you've hijacked the agenda
<Sync time="139.440"/>
likely over something that's
<Sync time="140.770"/>
ral- rather unimportant
<Sync time="142.780"/>
uh
<Sync time="143.180"/>
and therefore it's going to be a big impediment to actually enacting your agenda .
<Sync time="147.105"/>
but
<Sync time="148.005"/>
further i ultimately think that this is uh a quite bad
<Sync time="151.385"/>
way to conduct
<Sync time="151.900"/>
politics because recall election just result in a
<Sync time="154.620"/>
further fueling of animosity um .
<Sync time="157.360"/>
it further contributes to the seemingly constant
<Sync time="159.930"/>
um election atmosphere
<Sync time="161.995"/>
the constant adversarial atmosphere
<Sync time="164.555"/>
where constantly trying to get the other party out of power in every way possible
<Sync time="168.695"/>
and that's obviously not very good or conducive to
<Sync time="171.705"/>
solution solving uh
<Sync time="173.395"/>
problem solving
<Sync time="174.595"/>
which is bad because there's a lot of problems that do need to be solved that aren't getting solved . 
<Sync time="179.080"/>
so for those reasons we should not introduce recall elections .
