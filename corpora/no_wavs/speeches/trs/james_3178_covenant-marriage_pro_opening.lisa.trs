we should introduce covenant marriage .
<Sync time="3.515"/>
so
<Sync time="4.240"/>
covenant marriage is a legal category of marriage which is available in three states in america .
<Sync time="11.020"/>
basically it requires that the
<Sync time="13.265"/>
uh people who are engaged
<Sync time="15.350"/>
obtain some sort of premarital counseling
<Sync time="17.920"/>
and that as a result of this
<Sync time="20.070"/>
after they get married
<Sync time="21.580"/>
it will be more difficult for them to seek divorce for instance ,
<Sync time="24.890"/>
they might be required to live apart for a certain amount of time
<Sync time="27.860"/>
or otherwise face higher legal barriers to divorce
<Sync time="31.280"/>
than other people would
<Sync time="32.480"/>
but i'd like to point out the divorce is not impossible after receiving a covenant marriage
<Sync time="36.900"/>
only relatively difficult .
<Sync time="39.190"/>
very few people have taken advantage of this in america even though it's been around for a couple of decades .
<Sync time="45.330"/>
so now that we have some groundwork for the debate ,
<Sync time="47.950"/>
i'd like to advance a couple of arguments for why we should introduce covenant marriage .
<Sync time="52.750"/>
first ,
<Sync time="53.455"/>
we think that people deserve to have as many options as possible about how they want to define
<Sync time="58.640"/>
their marriage and their relationship to the state .
<Sync time="61.630"/>

<Sync time="62.360"/>
there are two parts of any marriage .
<Sync time="64.290"/>
first of all , you have the relationship between two individuals .
<Sync time="67.800"/>
obviously people should have the maximum amount of freedom possible
<Sync time="71.100"/>
when creating a relationship with another person .
<Sync time="74.140"/>
we think that people have a right to self-actualize that this is implicit in the laws of many countries
<Sync time="79.270"/>
that give people the ability to speak , to live ,
<Sync time="81.750"/>
to do what they want
<Sync time="83.040"/>
and that ultimately ,
<Sync time="84.495"/>
because of this , we should extend
<Sync time="86.615"/>
a lot of freedom to people in terms of establishing relationships with others .
<Sync time="91.260"/>
but marriage is also a legal contract . so this also involves one's relationship with the state .
<Sync time="96.690"/>
we think that again ,
<Sync time="97.560"/>
people should have the maximum amount of freedom to define their relationship with the state .
<Sync time="102.270"/>
if existing forms of marriage
<Sync time="104.250"/>
don't offer what you want to receive from your relationship with the state of which you are a citizen
<Sync time="109.200"/>
then we think that whenever reasonable , the government should try to accommodate you
<Sync time="113.190"/>
for instance , by introducing things like civil partnerships for gay people .
<Sync time="117.420"/>
we think that covenant marriages fill a similar role for certain religious communities
<Sync time="121.775"/>
who want to have more barriers in place to divorce because they think it's unethical .
<Sync time="126.400"/>
ultimately there's very little harm to offering people the ability to have a covenant marriage .
<Sync time="131.500"/>
no one's being forced to take it after all .
<Sync time="133.735"/>
if people want to get a traditional marriage they still can
<Sync time="136.545"/>
and we've seen in the u. s. states that have adopted it ,
<Sync time="139.340"/>
that many people do
<Sync time="141.320"/>
but on top of that ,
<Sync time="142.580"/>
divorce is also not impossible in these covenant marriages . so it's not like it's
<Sync time="146.345"/>
fundamentally a different type of relationship with the state
<Sync time="149.490"/>
than any other type of marriage ,
<Sync time="151.070"/>
it's just one in which it's more difficult to nullify the contract .
<Sync time="154.655"/>
with this in mind , we think that there are very few drawbacks to introducing this policy .
<Sync time="159.480"/>
it clearly has a benefit to some group of people even if most people won't take advantage of it
<Sync time="164.105"/>
and it doesn't actually harm anyone . everyone who participates is freely consenting into it
<Sync time="168.895"/>
and ultimately the contract is consistent with other principles .
<Sync time="172.500"/>
with that in mind , i think it's clear that we should introduce covenant marriage .
<Sync time="176.225"/>

<Sync time="176.980"/>
but aside from that , we tell you that it's very likely that people are doing something similar to this
<Sync time="182.320"/>
whether or not the state
<Sync time="183.730"/>
condones it .
<Sync time="184.735"/>
at that point we think it's better to regulate the practice rather than just ignore it .
<Sync time="189.080"/>
what do i mean by this ?
<Sync time="190.750"/>
religious communities
<Sync time="191.830"/>
already put barriers in place for their members to get divorced .
<Sync time="195.490"/>
they might require that people meet with a priest or a counselor before pursuing a divorce for instance .
<Sync time="201.010"/>
for members of these communities
<Sync time="202.520"/>
even though there is no uh
<Sync time="204.090"/>
civil or secular law preventing them from getting a divorce ,
<Sync time="207.250"/>
these religious regulations
<Sync time="208.795"/>
may as well have the force of law .
<Sync time="211.445"/>
we can see this is true because people hold very deep
<Sync time="214.655"/>
and serious religious beliefs which tell them that divorce might be unethical ,
<Sync time="218.565"/>
or that they need to respect the words of a religious elder .
<Sync time="221.720"/>
so with that in mind , it's likely that people are already facing barriers to divorce .
<Sync time="226.570"/>
we think that by introducing this to the legal sphere you can do things like limit the potential for abuse for instance ,
<Sync time="232.450"/>
facilitate people getting a divorce if there's been spousal abuse
<Sync time="235.670"/>
in an instance when
<Sync time="236.895"/>
their religious community might not be as supportive .
<Sync time="240.180"/>
so with these ideas in mind ,
<Sync time="241.760"/>
we should introduce covenant marriage .
<Sync time="243.920"/>
thank you .
