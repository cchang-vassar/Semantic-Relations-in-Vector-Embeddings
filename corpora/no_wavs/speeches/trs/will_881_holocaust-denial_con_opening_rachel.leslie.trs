i'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion
<Sync time="2.420"/>
that we should criminalize holocaust denial .
<Sync time="5.050"/>
two independent points ,
<Sync time="6.625"/>
first is freedom of speech .
<Sync time="9.160"/>
gov explains to you in their speech that
<Sync time="11.515"/>
this is essentially something that causes harm
<Sync time="14.720"/>
using the uh , you know , 
<Sync time="15.800"/>
shouting fire in a crowded theater type standard .
<Sync time="18.400"/>
well i think that standard makes sense , that speech that causes tangible harm
<Sync time="22.580"/>
should be restricted .
<Sync time="24.190"/>
i think there's a lot of problems with the way in which this standard is then applied to holocaust denial by side government .
<Sync time="30.685"/>
the first is that holocaust denial is a simple idea statement .
<Sync time="35.085"/>
it is not , you know , an actual call to arms or a call to action .
<Sync time="39.510"/>
this is a problem because gov repeatedly insists that there is
<Sync time="42.830"/>
acts of violence which correlate strongly with holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="46.620"/>
but i don't think this is a sufficient standard for actually abolishing the type of speech .
<Sync time="50.725"/>
that
<Sync time="51.095"/>
just because it correlates and is often associated with violence ,
<Sync time="54.990"/>
doesn't mean that you should , you know ,
<Sync time="56.610"/>
completely restrict the notion
<Sync time="58.500"/>
is bad , and
<Sync time="59.890"/>
generally under any sort of , you know , construct of what free speech is and why it matters ,
<Sync time="64.550"/>
expression of ideas and opinions
<Sync time="66.730"/>
is paramount to its preservation .
<Sync time="69.230"/>
but the second
<Sync time="70.470"/>
is that , you know ,
<Sync time="71.650"/>
when um
<Sync time="72.600"/>
the second standard way in which she applies the standard is to say that
<Sync time="76.170"/>
there is psychological damage intrinsic to expression of the idea .
<Sync time="79.810"/>
wholly speaking , this is a
<Sync time="81.620"/>
bad standard for when we should restrict freedom of speech .
<Sync time="85.200"/>
most ideas ,
<Sync time="86.300"/>
most opinions ,
<Sync time="87.440"/>
create some sort of psychological damage .
<Sync time="90.010"/>
you know ,
<Sync time="90.520"/>
expression of support for communism probably establishes some level of psychological damage for , you know , people who fled the russian regime .
<Sync time="98.020"/>
expression of support for fascism probably ex- , you know , is s-
<Sync time="101.670"/>
ni- it creates that sense of problems for uh ,
<Sync time="104.230"/>
you know , people who fled the italian regime .
<Sync time="106.680"/>
lots of ideas
<Sync time="107.980"/>
have really problematic applications for lots of people .
<Sync time="111.440"/>
even if that psychological damage and that ,
<Sync time="113.620"/>
you know , that pain that people feel when it is brought up is extremely real ,
<Sync time="117.305"/>
it is a bad standard to apply universally ,
<Sync time="119.955"/>
because that intrinsically winds up with restrictions on large amounts of speech and opinions .
<Sync time="125.330"/>
this limits discourse . this limits people's right to autonomy and free speech , wholly speaking ,
<Sync time="130.345"/>
and we think this is extremely , extremely problematic .
<Sync time="134.110"/>
my second independent point is that
<Sync time="136.300"/>
underground discourse , which is what happens on their side of the house , is worse than the world in which people openly discuss holocaust denial .
<Sync time="143.440"/>
so even if you think that this is something that
<Sync time="145.620"/>
free speech doesn't protect and it's just an
<Sync time="147.715"/>
awful idea that people really shouldn't be discussing ,
<Sync time="150.790"/>
i don't think that the policy actually does that .
<Sync time="153.720"/>
people still have these conversations
<Sync time="155.740"/>
but they have them , you know , on things like
<Sync time="157.600"/>
online chat rooms , or in , you know , dark csh- clo-
<Sync time="160.570"/>
closed rooms or whatever ,
<Sync time="162.530"/>
like this isn't something that goes away .
<Sync time="164.645"/>
this has two impacts .
<Sync time="166.040"/>
first is that now it festers in the worst way possible .
<Sync time="169.580"/>
people radicalize because there's never question on their beliefs .
<Sync time="173.320"/>
these conversations exclusively happen in like literal echo chambers , online
<Sync time="178.290"/>
locations where there is
<Sync time="179.615"/>
no voice of opposition expressed
<Sync time="181.710"/>
and as a result ,
<Sync time="182.715"/>
the
<Sync time="183.145"/>
belief system coalesces into the anti-semitism
<Sync time="186.330"/>
that side gov so obviously is trying to avoid .
<Sync time="189.870"/>
but {secondl--y/secondly} ,
<Sync time="191.825"/>
i think that there's less converts to these radical ideas when you have it
<Sync time="196.110"/>
uh expressed in a public forum .
<Sync time="198.270"/>
the reason for this is that the way in which , you know ,
<Sync time="200.550"/>
radical {anti-semitist/anti-semitic} groups generally recruit their members
<Sync time="203.880"/>
is through things like ,
<Sync time="205.325"/>
you know , targeting people who feel like they are
<Sync time="207.450"/>
rejects of society ,
<Sync time="208.860"/>
bringing them into these like closed , you know , like online chambers and things like that ,
<Sync time="213.150"/>
and then subjecting them to the echo chamber where these beliefs are never questioned .
<Sync time="217.585"/>
we think when these conversations happen in public though ,
<Sync time="220.595"/>
there is a capacity to , you know , challenge them through the media , through online discourse , through literal interpersonal discourse ,
<Sync time="227.420"/>
and as a result , we think it's much harder for these radical groups to just
<Sync time="230.965"/>
recruit people , because the beliefs are questioned , because there is that voice of opposition . and as a result , we think it's much better with this is a frank conversation that we have out in the open rather than allowing , you know , anti-semites to just
<Sync time="243.610"/>
have these closed-door conversations where they're
<Sync time="246.040"/>
uh reinforcing their own ideas and are never questioned .
<Sync time="249.280"/>
proud to oppose .
<Sync time="250.688"/>
