two points in the speech : first ,
<Sync time="2.480"/>
a principle justification for a_s_b_o's and second ,
<Sync time="6.060"/>
why these laws are necessary to protect citizens from actual harm .
<Sync time="10.780"/>
before that , a few points of refutation to the previous speaker . so he starts by saying that the law is meant to protect freedoms and that a_s_b_o's harm freedom .
<Sync time="20.160"/>
why ? because in their mind
<Sync time="22.400"/>
there is no actual harm here , this is just behavior that bothers people .
<Sync time="26.400"/>
so we
<Sync time="27.390"/>
don't understand
<Sync time="28.800"/>
on what grounds they separate here between
<Sync time="31.320"/>
something that bothers people
<Sync time="33.090"/>
and harm .
<Sync time="34.175"/>
if we're talking , for instance , about a neighbor that insists on playing his music really really loud then this is
<Sync time="39.790"/>
harassment .
<Sync time="40.780"/>
plain and simple . this is an actual harm
<Sync time="42.980"/>
for all we know .
<Sync time="44.530"/>
then they say that the law
<Sync time="47.000"/>
mustn't interfere with social behavior .
<Sync time="49.930"/>
antisocial behavior , in their minds , is a problem 
<Sync time="52.640"/>
like it's a failure of society and therefore it's society's responsibility
<Sync time="56.560"/>
to intervene .
<Sync time="57.660"/>
well we have two answers here :
<Sync time="59.510"/>
first being like
<Sync time="61.185"/>
uh violent criminal offenses are often a result
<Sync time="64.870"/>
of failures of society as well . so according to this logic we must also let society handle armed robbers that came from a poor background
<Sync time="73.080"/>
rather rather than legally intervene .
<Sync time="75.570"/>
we think that this is crazy .
<Sync time="77.590"/>
secondly ,
<Sync time="78.610"/>
we're going to explain in our positive point why we think that society simply cannot handle this issue well .
<Sync time="85.170"/>
so the second point that comes in their speech is that
<Sync time="88.840"/>
these laws are very vague . it's unclear to me when
<Sync time="92.080"/>
am i
<Sync time="92.790"/>
like breaking the law or not .
<Sync time="94.910"/>
we would say that this is
<Sync time="96.510"/>
imprecise .
<Sync time="98.550"/>
we would remind
<Sync time="99.855"/>
uh you that there are two
<Sync time="102.340"/>
stages to this process . firstly i get the a_s_b_o
<Sync time="106.580"/>
after i demonstrated some antisocial behavior and only then if i break it i
<Sync time="111.415"/>
i break the law .
<Sync time="112.820"/>
so
<Sync time="113.535"/>
it's true that there's a certain amount of vagueness as to when
<Sync time="117.510"/>
such an
<Sync time="118.500"/>
a_s_b_o might be issued to me ,
<Sync time="121.300"/>
but up until that point i haven't done anything illegal and therefore
<Sync time="124.965"/>
there's like
<Sync time="125.925"/>
no problem of the law being unclear here .
<Sync time="128.805"/>
in the
<Sync time="129.660"/>
a_s_b_o itself ,
<Sync time="131.080"/>
things will be very clearly defined . and so i could know exactly how i must behave in order not to break
<Sync time="136.935"/>
the law .
<Sync time="138.290"/>
let's move o-
<Sync time="139.080"/>
over to the positive . so
<Sync time="141.045"/>
a principle justification .
<Sync time="142.750"/>
so
<Sync time="143.425"/>
right in the end of the previous speaker's
<Sync time="146.370"/>
speech
<Sync time="147.175"/>
he says something about
<Sync time="148.630"/>
people needing to have a mens rea ,
<Sync time="150.735"/>
an ill intention ,
<Sync time="152.130"/>
in order to break the law .
<Sync time="153.430"/>
but that is also not precisely the case . we say that there are some laws that don't require a malign intent , namely negligence laws ,
<Sync time="161.830"/>
and we think that this is very similar to this case .
<Sync time="164.540"/>
we're going to justify a_s_b_o's as something akin to negligence .
<Sync time="168.680"/>
in cases of negligence you can be
<Sync time="171.420"/>
um
<Sync time="172.380"/>
criminally liable
<Sync time="174.335"/>
for your actions because you failed to meet the standard that society , or the court for that matter ,
<Sync time="180.530"/>
define as the standard of the reasonable person .
<Sync time="184.215"/>
so in this case as well 
<Sync time="186.560"/>
like in in our case as well we we think that there are
<Sync time="189.105"/>
there's a certain
<Sync time="190.085"/>
type of behavior that we can expect people to reasonably follow
<Sync time="194.110"/>
and whoever fails to do that , by the same logic ,
<Sync time="196.830"/>
can be held liable .
<Sync time="198.830"/>
moreover we think that in many cases
<Sync time="201.085"/>
there is malign intent in the cases of a_s_b_o's . it's not hard to imagine
<Sync time="205.620"/>
people that are just simply jackasses and that they
<Sync time="208.615"/>
raise the volume up to spite their neighbors .
<Sync time="211.670"/>
so there's mens rea , there's actus reus , and there's no problem
<Sync time="214.800"/>
of um of uh
<Sync time="217.675"/>
like
<Sync time="218.305"/>
holding them liable .
<Sync time="219.920"/>
which brings me to my
<Sync time="221.505"/>
final point :
<Sync time="222.960"/>
these laws are necessary in order to protect citizens from harm .
<Sync time="226.710"/>
why ? because we say that
<Sync time="228.425"/>
we can't just expect society to pass on manners to people successfully like
<Sync time="234.165"/>
the the previous speaker wants .
<Sync time="235.645"/>
as long as there is no significant sanction
<Sync time="238.265"/>
then the bully
<Sync time="240.280"/>
has nothing to be afraid of .
<Sync time="241.870"/>
if i'm antisocial and i don't care what people think about me which is the only
<Sync time="246.650"/>
sanction
<Sync time="247.760"/>
that society knows to to
<Sync time="250.035"/>
like give you , like
<Sync time="251.150"/>
that other people won't like you , but if i am antisocial i don't care what other people think about me so i have no incentive 
<Sync time="257.180"/>
and nothing to stop me
<Sync time="258.550"/>
from bothering other people . and therefore we need
<Sync time="260.970"/>
the law
<Sync time="261.675"/>
to give teeth
<Sync time="262.605"/>
to uh this
<Sync time="264.375"/>
ban and deter people from doing this .
<Sync time="267.235"/>
for all these reasons please oppose .
<Sync time="269.861"/>
