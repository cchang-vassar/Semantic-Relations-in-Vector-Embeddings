we should adopt
<Sync time="1.590"/>
libertarianism because it is both morally and practically the correct thing to do .
<Sync time="6.110"/>
so , let's start by talking about what we mean by adopting libertarianism .
<Sync time="10.720"/>
so , we're going to
<Sync time="12.070"/>
get rid of everything
<Sync time="13.850"/>
that is possible to get rid of as far as government services are concerned .
<Sync time="17.680"/>
so what does this mean ?
<Sync time="19.185"/>
we're going to have only basic safety services , so things like fire and the police .
<Sync time="24.755"/>
the
<Sync time="25.435"/>
police should be smaller than it is now
<Sync time="28.430"/>
um as s- should the military .
<Sync time="30.820"/>
you shouldn't get involved in international conflicts or things like that .
<Sync time="33.790"/>
basic health and uh safety services .
<Sync time="36.190"/>
so ,
<Sync time="36.955"/>
obviously you're gonna have to have some degree of public health to make sure that people can stay healthy
<Sync time="41.620"/>
and
<Sync time="42.360"/>
third ,
<Sync time="42.860"/>
laws and basic legal structures to make sure that there's a way to mediate disputes between people ,
<Sync time="48.225"/>
uh ,
<Sync time="48.900"/>
through like a public system . so you wanna have a public body of laws .
<Sync time="52.330"/>
uh
<Sync time="53.025"/>
all of these basic things are going to be done is minimally as possible
<Sync time="56.440"/>
and that's how it's going to happen .
<Sync time="58.640"/>
everything else -
<Sync time="59.480"/>
gone . %hes
<Sync time="60.960"/>
all regulations -
<Sync time="62.320"/>
gone .
<Sync time="63.130"/>
everything gone .
<Sync time="64.085"/>
so ,
<Sync time="64.780"/>
let's talk about why this is just the way that we should
<Sync time="67.340"/>
that that things have to be .
<Sync time="68.995"/>
so 
<Sync time="70.300"/>
first i think that
<Sync time="71.935"/>
this is the only way to ensure that people are able to maximize their individual conceptions
<Sync time="77.640"/>
about the best way to live their lives .
<Sync time="79.920"/>
so here's the problem :
<Sync time="82.440"/>
pretty much everyone in society
<Sync time="84.370"/>
disagrees on a lot of things . some people agree but by and large most people don't agree on just about everything , and the problem
<Sync time="91.055"/>
is is that one of the things that it's intrinsic to
<Sync time="93.920"/>
government interference
<Sync time="95.510"/>
is that
<Sync time="96.295"/>
it controls the way in which people can live their lives .
<Sync time="99.270"/>
so every time the government passes a regulation , every time the government passes a ban
<Sync time="103.800"/>
or every time the government gives out a subsidy ,
<Sync time="106.740"/>
it's directing
<Sync time="107.915"/>
some kind of ,
<Sync time="108.680"/>
it's doing some kind of
<Sync time="109.755"/>
preference and this is going to be at the expense of some other kind of person .
<Sync time="113.090"/>
so i think that this is deeply unjust
<Sync time="115.945"/>
because you can't just simply say that a majority of people is enough to justify the government depriving someone in some way .
<Sync time="122.270"/>
for example , if the majority wants to take away someone's right to have
<Sync time="126.020"/>
a like gay marriage with somebody
<Sync time="128.145"/>
or if the governmen- or if the majority wants to spend its money on ,
<Sync time="132.180"/>
or if the majority wants to like spend his money on something stupid ,
<Sync time="134.930"/>
like subsidizing
<Sync time="137.160"/>
um like
<Sync time="137.995"/>
%hes like a
<Sync time="139.140"/>
mission to mars or whatever . some
<Sync time="141.030"/>
some like random thing like if the government wants to spend like a billion dollars on something .
<Sync time="145.400"/>
these are things in which
<Sync time="146.820"/>
it has an impact on people .
<Sync time="148.545"/>
and this is a problem because
<Sync time="150.475"/>
the
<Sync time="151.300"/>
counterbalancing solution is that
<Sync time="153.235"/>
you can just not spend in all these things . people can have their own money and they can
<Sync time="156.800"/>
spend it on what they want to do .
<Sync time="158.065"/>
and i think this is also going to be
<Sync time="160.340"/>
uh much better because
<Sync time="161.965"/>
this means you're going to minimize rights violations .
<Sync time="164.890"/>
i think that when you take away people's property or you prevent them from exercising
<Sync time="169.780"/>
their autonomy in ways in which they choose ,
<Sync time="172.660"/>
this is akin to theft .
<Sync time="174.245"/>
its theft in that
<Sync time="175.960"/>
you steal someone's money
<Sync time="177.775"/>
and you are doing what you want with it
<Sync time="179.960"/>
because you think that it's going to be better .
<Sync time="181.980"/>
here's the problem :
<Sync time="183.960"/>
just because you think that this money is going to go towards better use
<Sync time="186.825"/>
or just because you think a band or a regulation is going to be good for society ,
<Sync time="190.640"/>
doesn't mean that you have a right to do that .
<Sync time="192.540"/>
because how it's best the live a life
<Sync time="194.940"/>
is ultimately up to the individual .
<Sync time="196.810"/>
some people may think that it's better to be free than to be
<Sync time="200.005"/>
like health you're safe .
<Sync time="201.600"/>
that's why some people may choose to do drugs or eat unhealthy even if there's consequences about that .
<Sync time="206.310"/>
people are autonomous rational beings with
<Sync time="209.260"/>
uh like free will , they can make their own choices .
<Sync time="211.780"/>
that's the best way in which people can be happiest and live the lives that want to .
<Sync time="215.355"/>
but finally , i think that this is going to be most efficient and effective .
<Sync time="218.545"/>
and the reason for that is because i think that individual people know how to spend our money better than the government .
<Sync time="223.770"/>
they know how to spend their money
<Sync time="225.540"/>
better than the government because
<Sync time="226.970"/>
if they want something then they can pay for it . if they don't want something they don't have to
<Sync time="231.155"/>
pay for it .
<Sync time="231.840"/>
um , if
<Sync time="232.650"/>
they value something then they can support it .
<Sync time="234.795"/>
and what this does is ultimately it makes sure that things that exist
<Sync time="238.920"/>
exist because individuals value them .
<Sync time="241.160"/>
so
<Sync time="241.905"/>
for all those reasons we should adopt libertarianism .
<Sync time="245.839"/>
