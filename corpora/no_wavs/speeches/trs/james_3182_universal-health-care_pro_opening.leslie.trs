we should introduce universal health care .
<Sync time="3.200"/>
so by this we mean to say that every country around the world
<Sync time="6.660"/>
should guarantee that all of their citizens
<Sync time="8.895"/>
have access to basic health care .
<Sync time="11.550"/>
so ,
<Sync time="12.440"/>
this might look like the national health service in england
<Sync time="15.650"/>
or it might look like an expanded version of obamacare , where private insurers but offer everyone insurance
<Sync time="21.770"/>
similar to the status quo in the u_s but more extensive .
<Sync time="25.035"/>
we're okay with any policy
<Sync time="26.990"/>
that ultimately ensures that everyone in your country can go to the doctor ,
<Sync time="30.710"/>
can fill prescriptions ,
<Sync time="32.110"/>
and can receive emergency care .
<Sync time="35.180"/>
three reasons why .
<Sync time="36.630"/>
first : we tell you that
<Sync time="37.930"/>
access to healthcare is a human right .
<Sync time="40.480"/>
why is this so ?
<Sync time="41.715"/>
well , the first reason ,
<Sync time="43.510"/>
if we think about
<Sync time="44.620"/>
uh rights that arise by convention or agreement , is that u_n member states have all agreed
<Sync time="49.890"/>
that there is a right to healthcare .
<Sync time="51.760"/>
we see that many u_n member states
<Sync time="53.880"/>
offered charity and aid to other countries to guarantee that those countries' citizens
<Sync time="58.080"/>
have access to health care , because it's recognized
<Sync time="60.585"/>
as a fundamental human right .
<Sync time="63.140"/>
but it's also a facilitative right we tell you .
<Sync time="66.445"/>
most every country in the world guarantees people some rights : the right to work ,
<Sync time="70.550"/>
the right to vote , the right to speech , to practice a religion ,
<Sync time="74.115"/>
and all of these things are contingent on access to healthcare .
<Sync time="78.080"/>
people who are dying because they lack access to pharmaceutical drugs and the like
<Sync time="83.030"/>
can't access other political rights .
<Sync time="85.340"/>
so we tell you that we need to introduce universal health care
<Sync time="88.285"/>
in order to uphold
<Sync time="89.620"/>
people's
<Sync time="90.245"/>
other rights which are more explicitly granted by their nation's constitutions .
<Sync time="94.610"/>
at that point , we see that this is both a right by convention and a facilitative right ,
<Sync time="98.510"/>
so it's clear
<Sync time="99.495"/>
that we should introduce universal health care
<Sync time="101.820"/>
in every country .
<Sync time="104.210"/>
our second argument
<Sync time="105.310"/>
is actually that universal health care will save nations money
<Sync time="108.850"/>
in the long term .
<Sync time="110.620"/>
let's think about what happened in america back before obamacare .
<Sync time="114.350"/>
many people would get sick and not go see the doctor because they didn't have access to health care .
<Sync time="119.265"/>
then , they would go to the emergency room where the law requires doctors to treat them .
<Sync time="124.220"/>
so someone who started out with a case of pneumonia
<Sync time="126.680"/>
that it would have cost fifty euros to treat with antibiotics ,
<Sync time="130.340"/>
now goes to the hospital and consumes thousands of dollars of health care ,
<Sync time="134.230"/>
because they need
<Sync time="135.205"/>
their lungs drained and they need intensive
<Sync time="137.710"/>
medical treatment that lasts for days .
<Sync time="139.920"/>
so we see that ultimately we would have saved a lot of money by offering this person
<Sync time="143.550"/>
a a primary care physician or a family doctor , depending on what they call them in different countries ,
<Sync time="149.050"/>
rather than having them turn to emergency services .
<Sync time="152.400"/>
but what's more , we also see many people go bankrupt in the u_s and some other countries although ,
<Sync time="157.570"/>
fortunately , few of them ,
<Sync time="158.880"/>
because of a lack of access to healthcare .
<Sync time="161.490"/>
people , for instance , who can't go to the doctor ,
<Sync time="164.060"/>
go to the emergency room ,
<Sync time="165.470"/>
run up enormous bills , and then declare bankruptcy .
<Sync time="167.960"/>
which means that the hospitals lose money ,
<Sync time="169.835"/>
and ultimately those hospitals have their debts written off
<Sync time="172.775"/>
by local or state governments because ,
<Sync time="175.300"/>
let's face it , hospitals have to be funded somehow .
<Sync time="178.035"/>
so , ultimately , we think everyone would save money , and this would help both individual citizens
<Sync time="182.835"/>
and also
<Sync time="183.950"/>
uh hospitals and municipal governments
<Sync time="186.110"/>
by offering health care .
<Sync time="188.510"/>
our third and final point is about economic growth .
<Sync time="191.730"/>
so ,
<Sync time="192.290"/>
i'll talk about first developed , then developing , countries .
<Sync time="195.680"/>
in a developed country , like the united states , we think that the economy would grow and be more stable
<Sync time="200.940"/>
if more people were employed in the health care sector .
<Sync time="203.830"/>
ultimately , increasing access to health care will also increase demand for healthcare ,
<Sync time="207.985"/>
which will lead to a health care boom .
<Sync time="210.115"/>
in developing countries , we tell you
<Sync time="212.380"/>
that a major problem is that many people are unable to find work because of illnesses that are easily preventable .
<Sync time="218.390"/>
many people in nepal , for instance ,
<Sync time="220.720"/>
have cataracts and eye disease that causes you to go blind .
<Sync time="224.250"/>
this is easily treatable
<Sync time="225.705"/>
but ultimately , people without health care can't access that . so they're not able to work .
<Sync time="229.700"/>
they become a drain on their community .
<Sync time="231.630"/>
but with basic access to health care , these people would be able to work once more and to contribute to their community .
<Sync time="236.855"/>
so , ultimately , for these reasons ,
<Sync time="238.900"/>
we should introduce universal healthcare .
<Sync time="240.960"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="241.669"/>
