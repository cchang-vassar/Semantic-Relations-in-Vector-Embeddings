we should disband nato .
<Sync time="2.140"/>
so , the north atlantic treaty organization is a military alliance between
<Sync time="6.785"/>
a group of global north countries like the u_s ,
<Sync time="9.900"/>
britain ,france , canada ,
<Sync time="11.610"/>
and other countries in europe .
<Sync time="13.420"/>

<Sync time="14.250"/>
we want to disband it for three reasons . the first , is that it has served its purpose .
<Sync time="18.500"/>
nato was created to protect europe from the soviet union .
<Sync time="21.620"/>
which
<Sync time="22.055"/>
obviously isn't around today and doesn't pose a risk anymore .
<Sync time="25.290"/>
we see that nato was probably very necessary at a time when you had
<Sync time="29.110"/>
thousands of
<Sync time="30.280"/>
soviet tanks in east germany , germany was a divided country ,
<Sync time="33.940"/>
there was a lot of concern about war ,
<Sync time="35.990"/>
the americans and the russians both wanted to put nuclear weapons in europe and that needed be moderated in some way .
<Sync time="41.850"/>
at that time ,
<Sync time="42.770"/>
there was an urgent need for the countries of the global north , these first world countries ,
<Sync time="47.385"/>
to work together to protect each other from communism ,
<Sync time="50.005"/>
and to structure their alliance in such a way that all of the countries could participate in it
<Sync time="54.790"/>
on some sort of equal footing .
<Sync time="57.025"/>
but at the point where nato was created in reaction to the soviet threat and the soviet union has been gone since before i was born ,
<Sync time="63.320"/>
it really seems like the alliance has run its course .
<Sync time="66.120"/>

<Sync time="66.740"/>
our second point is that we think nato was unnecessarily threatening to russia .
<Sync time="70.905"/>

<Sync time="71.440"/>
so remember that nato was founded explicitly to be anti soviet ,
<Sync time="75.510"/>
and that russia has taken on
<Sync time="77.145"/>
most of the responsibilities and duties of the soviet union in the international sphere .
<Sync time="81.920"/>
so what you have now is a country that's much weaker than the soviet union , russia has
<Sync time="85.820"/>
nothing approaching that kind of military power or influence ,
<Sync time="89.400"/>
but which faces the exact same military alliance .
<Sync time="92.920"/>
it's almost as though you have
<Sync time="94.305"/>
an eight hundred pound gorilla in the form of nato ,
<Sync time="97.405"/>
and instead of having another gorilla in the form of the warsaw pact and the soviet union , you just have a guy
<Sync time="102.790"/>
going up against it .
<Sync time="104.250"/>
we think that
<Sync time="104.850"/>
the russians with good reason feel threatened by the presence of american nuclear weapons 
<Sync time="109.330"/>
only a couple hundred miles from their border ,
<Sync time="111.410"/>
by the presence of
<Sync time="112.450"/>
thousands and thousands of american troops in germany ,
<Sync time="115.450"/>
ultimately it's very clear that nato members use
<Sync time="118.310"/>
russaphobic language as a unifying factor
<Sync time="121.330"/>
and they drill and practice
<Sync time="123.360"/>
for attacks against russia and defending against russian attacks
<Sync time="126.915"/>
and otherwise
<Sync time="127.930"/>
basically the alliance
<Sync time="129.780"/>
puts russian leaders in a position where one ,
<Sync time="132.480"/>
they can sell the threat of nato invad- invasion
<Sync time="135.555"/>
or the threat of nato attacks ,
<Sync time="137.390"/>
to maintain their own power and
<Sync time="139.245"/>
undermine democracy in their country .
<Sync time="141.245"/>
and two , where they have very legitimate concerns about the kind of weapons that are being deployed around their borders .
<Sync time="146.960"/>
it's probably true that most of the fears that people like vladimir putin claim to have are just a way to get support from the public ,
<Sync time="153.425"/>
but there is some legitimate concern about having
<Sync time="156.540"/>
an enemy
<Sync time="157.480"/>
alliance on your doorstep with nuclear weapons
<Sync time="160.110"/>
that exist solely to contain your country's interests .
<Sync time="163.495"/>

<Sync time="164.240"/>
this threat to russia's only bad for world peace and we think that getting rid of nato
<Sync time="168.220"/>
would do a lot to restore goodwill between russia and europe .
<Sync time="171.450"/>

<Sync time="172.220"/>
our third argument is that nato was an unfair
<Sync time="174.580"/>
alliance .
<Sync time="176.200"/>
this is for a couple reasons .
<Sync time="177.640"/>
on a financial level ,
<Sync time="179.000"/>
almost no countries in nato actually pay as much as they're supposed to into the common defense .
<Sync time="184.240"/>
we see that the united states picks up the vast majority of the tab while most european countries basically have no military .
<Sync time="190.265"/>
they're free riding on the back of this alliance and getting away with not defending themselves
<Sync time="194.820"/>
making the american taxpayer pay for it .
<Sync time="197.180"/>
we think it's unfair that americans have to pay to defend swedes and other people
<Sync time="201.075"/>
who aren't doing their fair share .
<Sync time="202.905"/>

<Sync time="203.640"/>
but on top of that , we think nato is also unfair in the other direction , because the u_s has such outsized control on it .
<Sync time="209.430"/>
although nato is nominally an alliance of equals , in practice 
<Sync time="213.070"/>
the u_s dictates what nato is going to do ,
<Sync time="215.550"/>
drags nato members into conflicts and proxy wars ,
<Sync time="218.455"/>
and ultimately is able to use it i to almost keep the europeans as
<Sync time="221.590"/>
satellite states ,
<Sync time="222.960"/>
sort of analogous to the old warsaw pact
<Sync time="225.200"/>
in eastern europe .
<Sync time="226.540"/>
and it seems true that the countries with the most independence are those with the largest militaries like britain or france ,
<Sync time="232.010"/>
while smaller countries
<Sync time="233.300"/>
with weaker militaries have less independence .
<Sync time="235.880"/>
so we think that at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="237.440"/>
nato was an unfair alliance to both the wealthier
<Sync time="240.315"/>
members who pay more than their fair share ,
<Sync time="242.785"/>
and to the smaller members who were
<Sync time="244.750"/>
suffer the dictates of the united states .
<Sync time="247.810"/>
so for these reasons , because it's served its purpose , because it undermines peace with russia ,
<Sync time="251.765"/>
and because it's an unfair alliance ,
<Sync time="253.560"/>
we should disband nato .
<Sync time="254.830"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="255.509"/>
