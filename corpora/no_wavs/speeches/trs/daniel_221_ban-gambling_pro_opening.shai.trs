we should ban gambling because gambling is essentially a way for corporations to steal money away f- or for governments to steal money away from poor people .
<Sync time="11.270"/>
um and i think this is a real problem .
<Sync time="13.420"/>
so ,
<Sync time="14.150"/>
when you look at like the opulent casinos in places like las vegas or even the opulent casinos in places like florida , where i grew up ,
<Sync time="23.875"/>
one of the common things you wonder is where do they get all of the money for these kinds of things ? where did they get all the money to fund these kinds of operations ?
<Sync time="32.395"/>
and
<Sync time="33.415"/>
the reason for that is clear .
<Sync time="35.690"/>
they get all this money because they're essentially stealing ,
<Sync time="39.310"/>
in the overall cases ,
<Sync time="41.085"/>
millions upon millio- uh
<Sync time="42.735"/>
millions of dollars , probably billions of dollars from the aver- from people .
<Sync time="46.575"/>
and they do this in rather insidious ways . it happens over time ,
<Sync time="51.035"/>
it happens
<Sync time="52.585"/>
on the individual level 
<Sync time="54.880"/>
but never the less , when it keeps happening over and over again
<Sync time="58.120"/>
it's billions of dollars that is being taken away from individual people .
<Sync time="62.000"/>
so ,
<Sync time="62.920"/>
i think that first and foremost the government should ban and paternalize it
<Sync time="67.140"/>
because i think this is money poorly spent . i think that any amount of money that is being spent on gambling
<Sync time="72.980"/>
is money that could be spent on anything more useful .
<Sync time="75.830"/>
it could be spent on like
<Sync time="78.075"/>
uh any kind of good or service . it could be spent on like education , it could be spent on
<Sync time="83.065"/>
pretty much anything that's more useful than just wasting it
<Sync time="85.995"/>
and giving it to a corporation that provides almost no services at all .
<Sync time="89.800"/>
but i think that what's even more insidious , is that oftentimes the government props up gambling .
<Sync time="94.920"/>
so when you look at places so when you look at
<Sync time="97.165"/>
things like a lottery for example , which are a form of gambling ,
<Sync time="100.550"/>
this is essentially just trying to like
<Sync time="102.400"/>
trick
<Sync time="102.860"/>
the average person into spending
<Sync time="105.430"/>
whatever amount of money they have ,
<Sync time="107.500"/>
whether it's five dollars or ten dollars or whatever ,
<Sync time="110.060"/>

<Sync time="110.760"/>
and spending that money on
<Sync time="113.640"/>
a pointless thing . because of the end of the day
<Sync time="116.395"/>
the odds of actually winning in those gambling situations are incredibly unlikely
<Sync time="121.060"/>
and you're basically just throwing that money away , and i think that's a big problem .
<Sync time="124.440"/>
i think that this is where the real focus of the debate is . because
<Sync time="128.520"/>
when you talk about like small scale individual gambling or even like
<Sync time="133.110"/>
internet gambling ,
<Sync time="134.400"/>
these are things that are so {unenforceful/unenforceable} . like you're never going to be able to regulate gambling between friends ,
<Sync time="139.720"/>
you're probably never going to be able to fully regulate gambling on the internet ,
<Sync time="143.725"/>
so i think that when you ban gambling
<Sync time="145.900"/>
you're specifically attacking the state
<Sync time="148.225"/>
who tries to take money from people by a lottery ,
<Sync time="150.900"/>
and you're attacking corporations who try to take money from people in this way .
<Sync time="154.420"/>
and i think that therefore
<Sync time="155.950"/>

<Sync time="156.360"/>
this is an incredibly big problem and it is also something that's incredibly feasible .
<Sync time="160.700"/>
because i don't think there's any real way around these kinds of things . i think that the best case scenario is that
<Sync time="166.050"/>
maybe people substitute it with other forms of gambling ,
<Sync time="169.230"/>
but i think that a lot of people are going to be 
<Sync time="171.330"/>
may be turned off by
<Sync time="173.140"/>
having to like do so illegally .
<Sync time="175.335"/>
and i think that
<Sync time="176.140"/>
one of the biggest reasons why people gamble is because there's an assumption that it's harmless ,
<Sync time="180.560"/>
there's an assumption that you're only spending a few dollars ,
<Sync time="183.110"/>
there's an assumption that it's not that big of a deal .
<Sync time="185.330"/>
but when it keeps happening over and over again , the money piles up over time and this is where i think the real problems come in
<Sync time="191.965"/>
and where i think poor choices are truly made .
<Sync time="194.605"/>
government has a duty to stop this
<Sync time="196.480"/>
so we're very proud to ban gambling .
