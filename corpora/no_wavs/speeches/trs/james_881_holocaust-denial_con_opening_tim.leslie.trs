holocaust denial
<Sync time="1.970"/>
should not be banned .
<Sync time="3.850"/>
we have three arguments for our side .
<Sync time="6.370"/>
the first is about why we prefer
<Sync time="8.290"/>
to challenge bad ideas
<Sync time="10.110"/>
rather than to hide them .
<Sync time="12.420"/>
so , let's think about what it looks like when you ban
<Sync time="15.040"/>
holocaust denial .
<Sync time="16.490"/>
people don't change their minds just because this is now illegal , and they don't stop teaching their children that the holocaust is a lie
<Sync time="22.870"/>
and things like that .
<Sync time="24.330"/>
instead what happens is that
<Sync time="26.005"/>
they learn to spread these
<Sync time="27.880"/>
uh horrible lies
<Sync time="29.565"/>
through private channels or ways that only people who think like them
<Sync time="33.180"/>
are going to be aware of .
<Sync time="35.510"/>
we would prefer a world where they publish these {idea--s/ideas}
<Sync time="37.950"/>
openly
<Sync time="39.100"/>
so that there's more of a public debate .
<Sync time="41.420"/>
although
<Sync time="41.980"/>
there is no academic debate about whether the holocaust happened ,
<Sync time="45.180"/>
having
<Sync time="45.900"/>
academics or leaders in the community come out and speak against holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="50.740"/>
to point out why it's absurd , to
<Sync time="52.875"/>
be sure that new people are seeing the evidence ,
<Sync time="55.270"/>
ultimately is better
<Sync time="56.405"/>
than pretending that holocaust denial doesn't exist .
<Sync time="59.865"/>

<Sync time="61.150"/>
we tell you that the best disinfectant
<Sync time="62.970"/>
is sunlight ,
<Sync time="63.850"/>
that when you're able to challenge people and force them to think critically about the idea of holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="69.500"/>
they'll realize that it's absurd and that the holocaust happened .
<Sync time="72.445"/>
but if nobody's challenging the idea because the public sphere never hears anyone deny the holocaust ,
<Sync time="78.250"/>
then people aren't going to realize that it's a real thing that happened .
<Sync time="81.520"/>
they're going to just accept , at face value ,
<Sync time="84.030"/>
the idea that the holocaust is some sort of , 
<Sync time="86.170"/>
i don't really know a lot about this , but like rothschild scheme or whatever these people say .
<Sync time="91.090"/>
and ultimately , they're not going to be able to think critically about it .
<Sync time="94.300"/>
so in our world , we tell you
<Sync time="95.685"/>
that when you challenge these ideas , ultimately more people see that they're bad ideas . we think that
<Sync time="100.600"/>
debate ,
<Sync time="101.460"/>
funny enough ,
<Sync time="102.220"/>
actually does have educational benefits
<Sync time="104.430"/>
in terms of making people aware of the truth .
<Sync time="107.470"/>
our next argument is that we want to raise awareness of the holocaust more generally .
<Sync time="113.340"/>
now it's easy for people to think everyone knows about the holocaust ,
<Sync time="116.850"/>
but we're living at a time when the generation that went through this uh this event is still alive .
<Sync time="122.410"/>
we think that in thirty years , when most of those people have passed away ,
<Sync time="126.170"/>
holocaust awareness , in general , is going to be much lower
<Sync time="129.265"/>
and that , in particular , in countries that don't have large jewish populations ,
<Sync time="133.380"/>
people are likely to focus less on the holocaust as world war two
<Sync time="137.090"/>
recedes from recent memory
<Sync time="138.810"/>
into , you know , the more distant past .
<Sync time="141.610"/>
we think that it's important that we're able to challenge holocaust denial , because this will increase the level of education about the holocaust
<Sync time="147.980"/>
more generally .
<Sync time="149.175"/>
the allies said in nineteen forty five that they would never forget ,
<Sync time="152.490"/>
but in order for that to be true , we have to keep educating young people
<Sync time="155.785"/>
about the holocaust .
<Sync time="157.400"/>

<Sync time="158.020"/>
fighting holocaust denial provides an impetus to do so .
<Sync time="161.175"/>
if you want children to do things like read books like " night " in schools ,
<Sync time="165.320"/>
then you need to provide a reason for the public to support them doing that ,
<Sync time="168.390"/>
and fighting against holocaust denial
<Sync time="170.410"/>
provides such an impetus .
<Sync time="172.610"/>
if holocaust denial goes underground and most people never hear about it ,
<Sync time="176.490"/>
then they're more likely to be okay with removing the holocaust from school curricula
<Sync time="180.055"/>
and then it'll be forgotten ,
<Sync time="181.550"/>
like the armenian genocide , which we think is an unacceptable outcome .
<Sync time="186.440"/>
our third and final argument is that if you criminalize holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="190.320"/>
it's harder to know who is a neo-nazi .
<Sync time="193.010"/>
we tell you that , right now , you can identify people who are neo-nazis or fascists or far-right extremists ,
<Sync time="199.020"/>
based on their views on the holocaust .
<Sync time="201.310"/>
if people are subscribing to magazines and newspapers that promote holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="205.580"/>
then we can put them on lists
<Sync time="207.010"/>
of potential members of the far right
<Sync time="208.725"/>
and things like that .
<Sync time="210.060"/>
in this way , we can keep an eye on these people , who pose a very real threat to democracy .
<Sync time="214.960"/>
if you criminalize holocaust denial , then these people go underground and we lose sight of them .
<Sync time="219.670"/>
they're able to pass as normal people ,
<Sync time="221.775"/>
and they won't be held responsible for their horrible and heinous beliefs .
<Sync time="225.785"/>
it'll be more difficult to crack down on them when they commit acts of terror ,
<Sync time="229.430"/>
which by the way the far right commits more acts of terror
<Sync time="232.280"/>
in america than any other group .
<Sync time="234.100"/>
islamic extremists , whoever you want to think about , they commit more acts of terror than anyone .
<Sync time="238.340"/>
so we can better put together an idea of who these networks are
<Sync time="241.765"/>
and who these people are and how they're spreading their horrible ideologies ,
<Sync time="245.130"/>
when we can track them through tracking
<Sync time="247.030"/>
holocaust denial materials .
<Sync time="249.030"/>
so for these reasons , holocaust denial should not be banned .
<Sync time="251.960"/>
thank you .
