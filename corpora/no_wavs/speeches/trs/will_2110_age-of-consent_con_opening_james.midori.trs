i am proud to oppose the motion that we should lower the age of consent .
<Sync time="4.570"/>
three independent points : first 
<Sync time="6.670"/>
is parental rights .
<Sync time="8.400"/>
so i want to establish something quite clearly :
<Sync time="11.010"/>
that the way the status quo
<Sync time="12.520"/>
looks is that if someone who is under age
<Sync time="15.480"/>
has sex with someone who is above the age of consent
<Sync time="18.660"/>
%hes um by a considerable amount , i'll get to the romeo and juliet laws and a little bit but ,
<Sync time="23.215"/>
like for the
<Sync time="24.460"/>
meantime let's recognize that it's a considerable gap in the status quo ,
<Sync time="28.520"/>
what happens is the parents make an active decision on whether or not they're going to press charges against that individual .
<Sync time="35.030"/>
we think this is important
<Sync time="36.405"/>
because it ensures that parents have the right to some degree of autonomy
<Sync time="40.300"/>
over their child sexual activity .
<Sync time="43.040"/>
the reason that we often make decisions about whether or not kids can make uh
<Sync time="47.220"/>
specific choices for themselves
<Sync time="49.530"/>
is because they don't have the
<Sync time="50.770"/>
necessary information about the world
<Sync time="53.365"/>
in order to have conf-
<Sync time="54.610"/>
informed consent .
<Sync time="56.045"/>
that is to say that they understand the implications of what they're doing and as such can agree to those implications .
<Sync time="62.400"/>
we proxy those decision making powers off to the
<Sync time="64.965"/>
parents in situations like say ,
<Sync time="67.095"/>
where they're going to go to school or
<Sync time="69.560"/>
whether they go to school , things like that .
<Sync time="72.250"/>
in order to ensure that ,
<Sync time="73.910"/>
essentially , someone who knows their best interest but also understands the world
<Sync time="78.630"/>
can help them with the decision making process .
<Sync time="81.280"/>
we think that lowering the age of consent then
<Sync time="83.960"/>
infringes upon those parental rights because it gets rid of the legal mechanism that allows parents to have some say in their child's sexual activity .
<Sync time="92.160"/>
often at such a young age , children
<Sync time="94.140"/>
don't understand the long term consequences of things like
<Sync time="97.450"/>
unprotected sex ,
<Sync time="98.850"/>
sex in a relationship with a power imbalance due to the age gap ,
<Sync time="102.585"/>
and other associated harms .
<Sync time="104.530"/>
as such we think it's important to protect that parental right to consent
<Sync time="108.520"/>
or parental right .
<Sync time="110.420"/>
our second independent point
<Sync time="111.630"/>
is power imbalances in relationships .
<Sync time="113.840"/>
so government talks pretty extensively about romeo and juliet laws .
<Sync time="117.890"/>
i want this to be clear ,
<Sync time="119.350"/>
romeo and juliet laws exist in the status quo .
<Sync time="123.020"/>
so if a seventeen year old has se- or a sixteen year old , rather , has sex with like an eighteen year old or a nineteen year old ,
<Sync time="129.130"/>
that's already legal in most states .
<Sync time="131.070"/>
i think the difference that's being established on side government
<Sync time="134.355"/>
is just how low you push the bar .
<Sync time="136.650"/>
you're not getting rid of the gray zone
<Sync time="138.470"/>
um on our side of the house .
<Sync time="140.860"/>
so then i think what's important to recognize
<Sync time="143.920"/>
is that
<Sync time="144.690"/>
power imbalances are um 
<Sync time="147.365"/>
that exist in relationships
<Sync time="149.155"/>
can
<Sync time="149.725"/>
basically jump drastically
<Sync time="152.170"/>
um over a small age range .
<Sync time="154.430"/>
so the amount of you know sexual maturity that an individual has
<Sync time="158.110"/>
and their knowledge of you know how relationships work and what consent is
<Sync time="162.255"/>
is
<Sync time="162.805"/>
drastically different between say ages sixteen and eighteen .
<Sync time="167.100"/>
we think that it's fundamentally problematic then to push the age of consent as low as government is insisting
<Sync time="172.545"/>
because we think if you push it down to like sixteen
<Sync time="175.555"/>
that creates like legal justification for a sixteen year old to say
<Sync time="179.580"/>
have sex with like a forty year old .
<Sync time="181.580"/>
that level of power imbalance is unacceptable and we think that it's important to ensure
<Sync time="186.340"/>
that once this person is free to have sex with someone of
<Sync time="189.285"/>
any age ,
<Sync time="190.280"/>
they are actually ready to make those decisions
<Sync time="192.455"/>
and they are capable of you know
<Sync time="194.400"/>
essentially standing up for themselves in situations
<Sync time="197.310"/>
where their
<Sync time="198.050"/>
age imbalance might materialize into a power imbalance .
<Sync time="202.350"/>
our third independent point is the signal that this policy sends .
<Sync time="206.475"/>
so we think that generally ,
<Sync time="208.505"/>
the state should look out for the interests of people .
<Sync time="211.060"/>
we think that a lot of the rhetoric surrounding age of consent laws is
<Sync time="214.880"/>
essentially protecting um
<Sync time="216.905"/>
children .
<Sync time="217.775"/>
that is to signal that people of this age ,
<Sync time="220.190"/>
our children ,
<Sync time="221.205"/>
are incapable often of informed consent of their own volition
<Sync time="225.370"/>
and as such need protection from the state .
<Sync time="228.090"/>
we think that lowering this age of consent
<Sync time="230.550"/>
sends the signal that people between sixteen and eighteen
<Sync time="233.840"/>
don't need those protections ,
<Sync time="235.525"/>
that they are capable of fending for themselves .
<Sync time="237.990"/>
we think that oftentimes this isn't true .
<Sync time="240.630"/>
so even beyond just the pragmatic impacts of what this policy entails ,
<Sync time="244.570"/>
we think there's a problematic signal sent from the state
<Sync time="247.560"/>
that then creates a societal discursive shift
<Sync time="250.925"/>
that is problematic for the individuals that are now going to be uh
<Sync time="254.550"/>
losing their legal protections . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="258.569"/>
