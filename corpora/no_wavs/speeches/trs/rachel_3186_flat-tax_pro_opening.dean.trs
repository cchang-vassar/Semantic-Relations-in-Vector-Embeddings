the motion for today's debate is that we should introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="4.430"/>
what this means is that in the united states where we currently tout a progressive tax the majority of the time
<Sync time="9.975"/>
we would instead
<Sync time="11.160"/>
institute
<Sync time="12.170"/>
um we would replace that tax with only a flat tax which would take
<Sync time="15.590"/>
the same percentage
<Sync time="16.985"/>
of um income from everyone regardless of
<Sync time="20.205"/>
how high their income is .
<Sync time="22.135"/>
so someone who was earning
<Sync time="24.695"/>
a hundred thousand dollars a year would still pay more in taxes than someone earning %hes only forty thousand
<Sync time="30.030"/>
but only because of the percentage
<Sync time="32.070"/>
not because the percentage goes up as you pay as you um
<Sync time="35.905"/>
um
<Sync time="37.220"/>
as you earn more .
<Sync time="38.850"/>
three main areas of clash ,
<Sync time="40.120"/>
first on the principle of fairness in this situation .
<Sync time="43.200"/>
we think that at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="44.770"/>
wages are meant to evaluate the labor that you put in
<Sync time="47.480"/>
and different forms of labor are worth different amount
<Sync time="50.480"/>
not even due to an objective metric
<Sync time="53.005"/>
um
<Sync time="53.520"/>
but rather because of the way that society
<Sync time="55.805"/>
values that , making this actually one of the most democratic systems that currently exists .
<Sync time="60.500"/>
it basically says that because
<Sync time="62.395"/>
that we take all these criteria ,
<Sync time="64.270"/>
how much energy you put into something :
<Sync time="66.460"/>
how much schooling you had to go through , how much that schooling maybe cost .
<Sync time="69.795"/>
and we say
<Sync time="70.650"/>
this is the metric by which we evaluate
<Sync time="73.860"/>
um how many how much your wages are
<Sync time="76.635"/>
uh and we think this is like the market is a pretty is p-
<Sync time="79.090"/>
does like a pretty good job of this
<Sync time="80.980"/>
insofar as clearly people are still willing to go into any number of positions
<Sync time="85.510"/>
um regardless of their wages ,
<Sync time="87.650"/>
it just changes the barriers
<Sync time="90.110"/>
in between .
<Sync time="91.260"/>
so we think that doctors make more than fry cooks because society %hes values the effort that both jobs require
<Sync time="97.235"/>
um and how much of an energy commitment they are
<Sync time="99.920"/>
and decided %hes that being a doctor deserves more compensation .
<Sync time="103.590"/>
given that we understand
<Sync time="105.570"/>
that
<Sync time="106.100"/>
um we think that how much each career makes
<Sync time="109.120"/>
um influences then
<Sync time="111.665"/>
how like what those people choose to put into it , so we think that everyone has access to the information that a doctor
<Sync time="117.320"/>
makes more than a fry cook
<Sync time="118.540"/>
and
<Sync time="118.970"/>
given this they make an educated decision
<Sync time="121.320"/>
based on
<Sync time="122.150"/>
this knowledge in combination with their knowledge of how much education they might need
<Sync time="125.960"/>
etcetera etcetera
<Sync time="127.100"/>
and
<Sync time="127.415"/>
become either a doctor or a fry cook .
<Sync time="130.860"/>
so
<Sync time="132.045"/>
given that you need to ta-
<Sync time="134.230"/>
so
<Sync time="135.200"/>
um given the end of that whatever you earn
<Sync time="137.540"/>
is in exchange for your labor ,
<Sync time="139.370"/>
it becomes the property of that individual who earned it .
<Sync time="143.160"/>
taxes regardless of what kind they are
<Sync time="145.530"/>
are a state are a form of state supported theft
<Sync time="148.540"/>
but given that you need some tax for public good
<Sync time="151.500"/>
that everyone agrees is necessary like roads are something that everyone needs
<Sync time="155.500"/>
etcetera
<Sync time="156.430"/>
we think that it's fundamentally unjust to steal more from some people on the basis of their income
<Sync time="161.700"/>
and that you need to promote a hard line
<Sync time="163.800"/>
when it comes to state spondor- sponsored thefts
<Sync time="166.755"/>
um
<Sync time="167.460"/>
as to what is justified and what is not .
<Sync time="170.015"/>
so we think that it's only fair if it's the same percentage from each person
<Sync time="173.740"/>
given that that way
<Sync time="174.740"/>
you're stealing the same percentage from each person .
<Sync time="177.670"/>
our second area of clash is about encouraging innovation .
<Sync time="180.775"/>
we think that getting more money is an incentive for people to exert themselves more than they are necessarily comfortable exerting themselves
<Sync time="187.240"/>
and a progressive tax removes the incentive because it reduces the margin of difference in economic growth .
<Sync time="192.640"/>
it makes the trade off of time for money
<Sync time="194.830"/>
harder to justify if the money is
<Sync time="197.320"/>
marginal in terms of its increase .
<Sync time="199.625"/>
we need but we need people to have an incentive to work harder
<Sync time="203.235"/>
in order to achieve greater efficiency
<Sync time="205.290"/>
like at the end of the day we need someone to serve as the manager or the boss or the director
<Sync time="209.550"/>
and if the extra hours that they spend
<Sync time="212.180"/>
in the professional arena
<Sync time="214.305"/>
um does not justify the amount of money that they earn because the progressive tax takes off so much of their raise ,
<Sync time="220.325"/>
then we're just not going to have anyone who's willing to become those
<Sync time="223.350"/>
because
<Sync time="223.850"/>
everyone loves maximizing the time they spend at home
<Sync time="226.660"/>
or relaxing .
<Sync time="227.950"/>
but we also think this is really important
<Sync time="230.110"/>
in terms of
<Sync time="231.200"/>
maximizing peoples' um
<Sync time="233.275"/>
incentives to create
<Sync time="234.845"/>
and to innovate like physically .
<Sync time="236.780"/>
we think the reason we have the majority of the great inventions in the world have to do with
<Sync time="240.765"/>
because we like respect patents
<Sync time="242.760"/>
and %hes
<Sync time="243.770"/>
respect intellectual property .
<Sync time="245.950"/>
um our third area of clash is just on why it maximizes efficiency .
<Sync time="249.540"/>
we think that it gets rid of having to file for taxes , no dividends , no i_r_s rules to comply with ,
<Sync time="254.750"/>
which just makes the entire tax process a lot easier .
<Sync time="257.525"/>
for these reasons , proud to propose .
<Sync time="260.759"/>
