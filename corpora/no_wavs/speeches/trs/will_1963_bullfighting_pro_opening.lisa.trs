we're proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should ban bullfighting .
<Sync time="4.945"/>
we'll model this as being enforced pretty comparably to other forms of animal fighting like dog fighting or cock fighting .
<Sync time="12.880"/>
um so that is to say that there are
<Sync time="14.890"/>
prison sentences or at least hefty fines with both people who
<Sync time="18.595"/>
organize these types of events
<Sync time="20.840"/>
as well as the individual trainers who own the animals that are then subjected to this type of violence .
<Sync time="27.500"/>
two independent points .
<Sync time="29.620"/>
our first being just sort of broadly animal rights and how bullfighting violates them .
<Sync time="35.285"/>
first
<Sync time="36.040"/>
establishing why animal rights
<Sync time="38.100"/>
exist and matter .
<Sync time="39.610"/>
um
<Sync time="40.080"/>
rights , generally speaking , are something that we think of as just something that's inalienable , something that's really fundamental to our nature and can't be infringed upon
<Sync time="48.140"/>
like say , our right to life
<Sync time="50.010"/>
something that we hold in very high regard
<Sync time="52.460"/>
and are generally going to prioritize above you know more simple like utilitarian impacts .
<Sync time="58.740"/>
oftentimes these are construed as being you know
<Sync time="60.900"/>
unique to humans but we think that the reason why they ought be extended to animals is that
<Sync time="65.525"/>
you know fundamentally there just isn't a consistent principle that justifies why these are unique to humans .
<Sync time="71.920"/>
um
<Sync time="72.955"/>
there's
<Sync time="73.715"/>
really two lenses through which this is generally seen .
<Sync time="76.625"/>
the one justifying humans only is sort of like an intelligence based standard . that is that because
<Sync time="82.010"/>
humans are very self aware and they're sentient and they're
<Sync time="85.150"/>
more intelligent than animals , they uniquely get rights .
<Sync time="88.300"/>
i think the problem is that there's not a well established bright line on this that the determines how intelligent you have to be for rights .
<Sync time="95.140"/>
um certainly one problem with this is that we
<Sync time="97.895"/>
generally think of humans with like intellectual
<Sync time="100.995"/>
uh disabilities or just generally unintelligent people
<Sync time="104.340"/>
still having rights .
<Sync time="105.970"/>
so i don't think it's a very principally consistent standard then to apply to .
<Sync time="110.310"/>
i think the more consistent standard is the other one which is just
<Sync time="113.565"/>
if something experiences pain and pleasure it deserves rights because suffering is bad .
<Sync time="118.895"/>
um i don't think there's any benefit to animal suffering , obviously not in a vacuum ,
<Sync time="123.530"/>
and as such it's something that we should consider as mattering . that
<Sync time="126.900"/>
when animals experience pain
<Sync time="129.295"/>
and we can
<Sync time="130.070"/>
demonstrably see that they are experiencing pain ,
<Sync time="133.560"/>
then we should you know
<Sync time="134.790"/>
not cause that pain .
<Sync time="136.360"/>
this is reflected in our norms actually . things like animal abuse are illegal
<Sync time="141.340"/>
um but like
<Sync time="142.820"/>
inconsistently we believe that killing them is fine .
<Sync time="146.130"/>
um i think particularly then , killing them through ways that are very inhumane and cause lots of
<Sync time="151.955"/>
lots of
<Sync time="152.755"/>
harm and pain and suffering onto the animal that are even torturous ,
<Sync time="156.850"/>
um should be considered especially reprehensible .
<Sync time="159.800"/>
bullfighting particularly represents this . um
<Sync time="162.800"/>
bullfighting
<Sync time="163.590"/>
involves a
<Sync time="164.360"/>
long , slow , and violent process
<Sync time="167.285"/>
by which the animal is killed .
<Sync time="169.400"/>

<Sync time="170.010"/>
um it's also subjected
<Sync time="171.935"/>
to like large amounts of violence just in the process of the bullfight and in the lead up to the bullfight . they're often
<Sync time="178.100"/>
held in inhumane conditions .
<Sync time="180.400"/>
as such , we think the bullfighting represents a lot of harm that is inflicted upon animals
<Sync time="184.910"/>
simply for human enjoyment and that this is
<Sync time="187.490"/>
principally unjust and should be banned ,
<Sync time="190.390"/>
but secondly , we think that a ban is justified
<Sync time="193.060"/>
even from a purely human-centric perspective
<Sync time="195.860"/>
because it's a process that hurts humans too .
<Sync time="198.620"/>
bullfighting is exceptionally dangerous .
<Sync time="201.270"/>
bulls are strong , they are fast ,
<Sync time="203.645"/>
and they are extremely extremely violent creatures .
<Sync time="207.340"/>
at that point then , humans are subjecting themselves
<Sync time="210.285"/>
to a large amount of risk
<Sync time="212.720"/>
simply for the purpose of entertainment .
<Sync time="215.015"/>

<Sync time="215.740"/>
in other forms of entertainment
<Sync time="217.400"/>
we've instituted bans on the basis of large amounts of risk
<Sync time="220.890"/>
um and i don't think that we should you know stop the buck simply because it's a cultural thing .
<Sync time="225.810"/>
generally it's part of our crul- culture
<Sync time="228.460"/>
is a weak argument simply on the basis that we have banned
<Sync time="231.740"/>
other things intrinsic to our culture
<Sync time="234.310"/>
um you know such as like slavery or other types of just inherently bad things on the basis that they cause suffering .
<Sync time="241.110"/>
given that ,
<Sync time="241.865"/>
i don't think that we should perpetuate something that puts humans at a significant amount of risk of
<Sync time="246.890"/>
suffering . prop to propose .
<Sync time="250.369"/>
