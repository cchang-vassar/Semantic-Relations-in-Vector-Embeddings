we should limit the right to asylum .
<Sync time="3.060"/>
so in this debate , we're not going to say that countries should stop offering asylum completely ,
<Sync time="7.935"/>
but rather that they should be extremely discerning
<Sync time="10.545"/>
in who is granted asylum .
<Sync time="12.740"/>
a few reasons why this should be the case .
<Sync time="15.190"/>
first , there's a tremendous cost to society of having the right to asylum .
<Sync time="20.160"/>
most often , people who come to a country
<Sync time="22.860"/>
for asylum don't have the means to support themselves .
<Sync time="26.060"/>
instead , they rely on some form of public {largiss/largesse} to support themselves
<Sync time="30.020"/>
until they're established .
<Sync time="31.615"/>
so at that point , you have people receiving benefits from the state who have never paid in
<Sync time="35.630"/>
in the form of taxes ,
<Sync time="36.995"/>
and who are not currently producing anything
<Sync time="39.155"/>
for society .
<Sync time="40.850"/>
while it's true that some of these people might be great thinkers or scientists , as we saw from people fleeing germany in the second world war ,
<Sync time="47.750"/>
many others are likely to be unskilled people who are just the victims of circumstances in their home countries ,
<Sync time="53.265"/>
such as many of the syrian refugees .
<Sync time="55.780"/>
we think that in order for states to continue to provide for their own people ,
<Sync time="59.430"/>
which must be their first and foremost concern ,
<Sync time="62.030"/>
they need to limit the right to asylum .
<Sync time="65.760"/>
our second argument is that if you don't limit the right to asylum , then people will take advantage of it
<Sync time="71.270"/>
in ways that we don't intend .
<Sync time="73.130"/>
right now , it's very difficult for most people to immigrate to a country like the united states ,
<Sync time="78.380"/>
while it's relatively easy to gain asylum , by comparison .
<Sync time="82.300"/>
we think that if it is
<Sync time="83.490"/>
easier to gain asylum than to go through immigration channels that more people who are actually
<Sync time="88.580"/>
immigrants will seek to have themselves
<Sync time="91.020"/>
labeled as asylum seekers .
<Sync time="93.425"/>
as an example of this , consider how many of the syrian refugees have , rather than staying in greece or eastern europe ,
<Sync time="100.790"/>
pressed on to germany ,
<Sync time="102.190"/>
because they want to live in a wealthier ,
<Sync time="103.880"/>
more powerful country
<Sync time="105.300"/>
rather than merely stay in the first country that can offer them asylum .
<Sync time="108.970"/>
we think that this is unfair to two groups : one ,
<Sync time="111.980"/>
citizens of these countries who now have these people coming in ,
<Sync time="115.040"/>
who have limited skills and limited ability to contribute to the economy ,
<Sync time="118.790"/>
and two ,
<Sync time="119.795"/>
legitimate immigrants , who are now effectively sent to the back of the line , behind these asylum seekers .
<Sync time="125.560"/>
many people have been on waiting lists for immigration for years and years , and now are unable to move to the country that they worked so hard to get into
<Sync time="132.660"/>
because asylum seekers are taking their spaces . we think that this is
<Sync time="136.220"/>
grossly unfair
<Sync time="137.580"/>
to those groups .
<Sync time="139.950"/>
and lastly , we would argue
<Sync time="142.795"/>
that we should limit the right to asylum in order to preserve it in the long term .
<Sync time="147.250"/>
in other words ,
<Sync time="148.840"/>
if there continues to be huge potential for abuse with the right to asylum ,
<Sync time="153.140"/>
then more and more countries are going to get rid of this right entirely .
<Sync time="156.760"/>
we think that it would be preferable for countries instead to limit the right to asylum .
<Sync time="160.960"/>
that's the comparative in this debate ,
<Sync time="163.000"/>
it's not the continued
<Sync time="164.370"/>
status quo , where countries are relatively generous with access to asylum .
<Sync time="168.730"/>
it is a world in which right-wing politicians , especially populists like donald trump
<Sync time="173.665"/>
or marine le pen ,
<Sync time="175.260"/>
are able to use
<Sync time="177.065"/>
the threat of people coming in to take jobs or to work
<Sync time="180.620"/>
as a tool to become elected , and then to crackdown
<Sync time="183.475"/>
on issuing asylum at all .
<Sync time="185.540"/>
so if you think that it's important that people have access to this right when they need it , such as victims of the syrian civil war ,
<Sync time="191.825"/>
then you need to promote a more
<Sync time="193.720"/>
conservative use
<Sync time="195.500"/>
of this right to asylum .
<Sync time="197.230"/>
offering it to too many people will undermine political support
<Sync time="200.665"/>
from even the most generous populaces .
<Sync time="203.910"/>

<Sync time="205.225"/>
at this point , we tell you that the right to asylum needs to be limited in order to protect
<Sync time="210.065"/>
the citizens of the country where these asylum seekers would go on to live ,
<Sync time="214.005"/>
in order to protect
<Sync time="215.415"/>
the people who are trying to come into the country legally through other forms of immigration ,
<Sync time="220.325"/>
and on top of that , in order to protect the right to asylum in the wrong term long term .
<Sync time="225.185"/>
so for these reasons , we should limit the right of asylum .
<Sync time="227.900"/>
thank you .
