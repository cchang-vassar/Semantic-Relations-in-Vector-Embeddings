i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should increase internet censorship .
<Sync time="5.830"/>
i want to begin with a quick overview that i think addresses the lion's share of gov's material
<Sync time="10.920"/>
and that is that
<Sync time="12.110"/>
if
<Sync time="12.540"/>
specific materials are illegal
<Sync time="15.390"/>
anyway ,
<Sync time="16.260"/>
we don't think that
<Sync time="16.860"/>
internet censorship is a necessary tool to enforce those laws .
<Sync time="20.870"/>
something like child pornography is illegal in its own right .
<Sync time="24.100"/>
the production , distribution , and ownership is itself a crime ,
<Sync time="28.085"/>
so we don't think then that it's actually necessary to even shut down the websites
<Sync time="32.940"/>
because we think they're just other avenues through which you can prosecute the individuals .
<Sync time="37.680"/>
if somebody downloads child pornography ,
<Sync time="40.375"/>
that itself is a crime .
<Sync time="42.060"/>
there's no need to bring down the medium
<Sync time="44.420"/>
because you can just prosecute the
<Sync time="46.135"/>
existing crimes that are on the books .
<Sync time="49.040"/>
censorship then seems an
<Sync time="50.550"/>
to be an unnecessary tool for most of gov's impacts .
<Sync time="53.580"/>
our first independent point
<Sync time="55.780"/>
is that there is a freedom of information intrinsic to the internet ,
<Sync time="59.495"/>
and that
<Sync time="60.120"/>
on this basis ,
<Sync time="61.270"/>
government intervention is unjustified .
<Sync time="63.930"/>
we think that there
<Sync time="65.200"/>
%hes really two basis for this .
<Sync time="67.310"/>
the first is more tied to freedom of speech , that is sort of
<Sync time="70.435"/>
the autonomy that is
<Sync time="71.900"/>
intrinsic to uh you know
<Sync time="73.830"/>
basic human rights , the freedom to do with your life as one pleases , and this is rooted in the fact that people are the best proxy for their own interests .
<Sync time="82.040"/>
we think then that it is unreasonable for governments to
<Sync time="85.125"/>
limit their uh you know basic
<Sync time="87.345"/>
our basic rights to access things that we please
<Sync time="90.590"/>
and that make us individually happy ,
<Sync time="92.805"/>
and as such ,
<Sync time="93.810"/>
absent things that are already
<Sync time="95.650"/>
illegal for obvious reasons ,
<Sync time="97.235"/>
we think that government limits on what sort of information and what sort of materials we can access are unjustified .
<Sync time="103.990"/>
even if this is something like you know
<Sync time="105.970"/>
isis ideology there is still a problem intrinsically
<Sync time="109.345"/>
with people intervening in
<Sync time="111.465"/>
uh individuals'
<Sync time="112.725"/>
want to access that material .
<Sync time="114.555"/>
but i think the second problem with these restrictions
<Sync time="117.010"/>
is that there isn't
<Sync time="117.670"/>
objectivity that's intrinsic to any government .
<Sync time="120.465"/>
we think that
<Sync time="121.560"/>
no conception of the good life is inherently correct ,
<Sync time="124.660"/>
insofar as our preferences are often
<Sync time="127.070"/>
shaped by the societies that we grow up in .
<Sync time="129.775"/>
so our perceptions of
<Sync time="131.430"/>
things like religion and things like justified uses of force
<Sync time="135.260"/>
are shaped by that society ,
<Sync time="137.580"/>
not by any sort of like universal moral code that is inherently objective .
<Sync time="142.200"/>
as such , it is
<Sync time="143.475"/>
unreasonable for governments to unfor- enforce a specific moral code .
<Sync time="148.390"/>
but secondly ,
<Sync time="149.440"/>
and i think this sort of ties back into it ,
<Sync time="151.690"/>
our second independent point
<Sync time="153.190"/>
is that there isn't a justification for jurisdiction over the internet
<Sync time="157.350"/>
because the internet is something that is international .
<Sync time="160.230"/>
we think then , because this is something international in nature and not defined by state borders ,
<Sync time="165.420"/>
it is unjust for individual governments to intervene in the type of information that is conveyed over it .
<Sync time="171.470"/>
look
<Sync time="172.545"/>
at the you know the basic nature of this
<Sync time="175.030"/>
is that it is a
<Sync time="176.150"/>
way for people to communicate across state borders ,
<Sync time="179.130"/>
um and it is a subculture in and of itself .
<Sync time="181.870"/>
no government has the right to intervene in this as such .
<Sync time="185.540"/>
our third independent point is that it
<Sync time="187.645"/>
warrants persecution narratives .
<Sync time="190.160"/>
so i think even if you take the objective moral code and you say ,
<Sync time="193.590"/>
okay this is what is inherently right and this is what is inherently wrong ,
<Sync time="197.360"/>
i still think that there is a pragmatic problem with internet censorship ,
<Sync time="201.115"/>
and that is that
<Sync time="202.070"/>
often these sort of like dredges of the internet your your neo nazi and your isis fighters
<Sync time="207.720"/>
thrive off of narratives that paint them is persecuted .
<Sync time="210.885"/>
the reason for this
<Sync time="212.310"/>
is that they often recruit people themselves who feel that they are
<Sync time="216.030"/>
isolated from the rest of society or rejected by it ,
<Sync time="219.760"/>
and as such
<Sync time="220.640"/>
when isis or neo nazis or whomever
<Sync time="223.430"/>
can
<Sync time="223.960"/>
essentially put forward a narrative that says we are persecuted too ,
<Sync time="227.555"/>
we are also being targeted by the masses of society ,
<Sync time="231.260"/>
there is you know a better ability to recruit
<Sync time="233.910"/>
essentially
<Sync time="234.750"/>
that they are more capable of bringing in
<Sync time="236.985"/>
large numbers of people to their cause .
<Sync time="239.315"/>
we think then that there is a significant amount of backlash associated with internet
<Sync time="243.380"/>
censorship ,
<Sync time="244.430"/>
and that because it is impossible to fully regulate every corner of the internet ,
<Sync time="249.040"/>
you can never achieve a full shut down of these organizations .
<Sync time="252.400"/>
rather , you can just push them further and further underground where they are tougher to fight
<Sync time="256.980"/>
and where they are more capable of bringing in large numbers of people who themselves
<Sync time="261.290"/>
see themselves as rejected . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="264.954"/>
