<Sync time="0.670"/>
we should ban school uniforms .
<Sync time="3.950"/>
so ,
<Sync time="4.520"/>
by ban school uniforms what we're really talking about ,
<Sync time="7.270"/>
is we think that
<Sync time="8.550"/>
in places like britain , where right now
<Sync time="10.980"/>
school children are required to all dress in the same outfit everyday ,
<Sync time="14.595"/>
we should do away with that practice and let children dress themselves within reason .
<Sync time="18.820"/>
we're okay with things like dress codes ,
<Sync time="20.650"/>
you know , requiring skirts to come to the knee ,
<Sync time="22.960"/>
or requiring that everyone tuck their shirt in , things like that ,
<Sync time="26.105"/>
but we don't think that a school should tell children
<Sync time="28.780"/>
exactly how to dress . so ,
<Sync time="31.510"/>
two arguments :
<Sync time="32.470"/>
first we're going to explain to you why we think this policy is bad for children ,
<Sync time="36.100"/>
and second we're going to talk about potential benefits of uniforms ,
<Sync time="39.615"/>
but why we don't think they're the most important thing .
<Sync time="41.990"/>

<Sync time="42.720"/>
so why are uniforms bad for children ?
<Sync time="45.330"/>
first of all we think that they stifle creativity .
<Sync time="47.860"/>

<Sync time="48.440"/>
recognize that young people can experiment with their identity and how they want to act
<Sync time="52.950"/>
in a relatively low cost way 
<Sync time="55.295"/>
while they're in secondary school .
<Sync time="57.330"/>
so if they want to try dressing up like people from different subcultures or experimenting with different looks ,
<Sync time="62.370"/>
they can do that and it won't affect their ability to get a job later in life .
<Sync time="66.000"/>
we think that everyone is pretty sympathetic to the idea that
<Sync time="68.805"/>
teenagers in particular
<Sync time="70.460"/>
don't really know what kind of people they want to be yet
<Sync time="72.580"/>
and want to try out
<Sync time="73.535"/>
lots of different ways of acting .
<Sync time="75.960"/>
so when you have uniforms you stifle the ability for children to experiment in this
<Sync time="80.925"/>
low cost setting what type of person they want to be .
<Sync time="84.360"/>
we think that this will lead to them having to figure these things out
<Sync time="86.740"/>
later in life , determine
<Sync time="88.115"/>
if they want to be part of a certain subculture or how they want to dress ,
<Sync time="91.360"/>
and ultimately that they will have higher cost then
<Sync time="93.715"/>
in terms of their ability to gain employment .
<Sync time="96.110"/>

<Sync time="96.810"/>
but we also think that
<Sync time="97.905"/>
young people don't learn how to dress
<Sync time="100.250"/>
if you give them a uniform .
<Sync time="102.370"/>
there's nothing more frustrating than being told to show up
<Sync time="104.580"/>
to an event
<Sync time="105.210"/>
business casual
<Sync time="106.640"/>
if you don't know what that means .
<Sync time="108.510"/>
we think that
<Sync time="109.185"/>
when young people have to dress themselves for school , they learn skills like this ,
<Sync time="112.980"/>
how to dress professionally , how to dress for certain events ,
<Sync time="116.020"/>
but they don't learn that as well if they have to wear uniforms because they dress the same every day and to have to put any thought into it .
<Sync time="121.810"/>
so we think that uniforms , by removing the requirement to think about clothes ,
<Sync time="125.490"/>
actually create an unrealistic expectation for young people
<Sync time="128.755"/>
about what the world is like 
<Sync time="130.420"/>
because how you dress absolutely does matter
<Sync time="132.690"/>
socially and professionally
<Sync time="134.395"/>
and young people aren't learning to think about it if they wear school uniforms .
<Sync time="137.980"/>

<Sync time="138.740"/>
next ,
<Sync time="139.970"/>
although this next issue might sound marginal we think the harms to the people it affects are very great .
<Sync time="144.650"/>
recognize that school uniforms really enforce the gender binary ,
<Sync time="148.215"/>
so if you have people who don't identify with the sex that they were assigned at birth , we think it's going to be
<Sync time="153.215"/>
very difficult for those people to have to wear school uniforms .
<Sync time="156.780"/>
if you give people some freedom about how to dress they can choose to subvert the sex they were signed at birth
<Sync time="161.450"/>
and experiment with their gender identity and things like that ,
<Sync time="164.245"/>
but you can't do that if you have to wear a school uniform .
<Sync time="166.990"/>
if your school tells you that boys have to wear trousers and girls have to wear skirts
<Sync time="170.575"/>
and you're transgender , you have no way to get around this policy .
<Sync time="173.470"/>
and we think that that's likely to be very stifling for these people ,
<Sync time="176.630"/>
and while there may be relatively few transgender people , we think that the harms of gender dysphoria
<Sync time="180.960"/>
are so great and the costs of letting children dress themselves
<Sync time="184.055"/>
are so little , that clearly we should defer to this concern .
<Sync time="187.100"/>

<Sync time="187.650"/>
and lastly in terms of a financial burden ,
<Sync time="190.500"/>
i'm sure that the other team is going to get up here and say that schools can pay for the uniforms of children who can't afford them ,
<Sync time="195.830"/>
but there's no such thing as a free lunch .
<Sync time="197.950"/>
somebody is ultimately paying for these school uniforms .
<Sync time="200.960"/>
and recognize that young people can't wear these uniforms outside of school ,
<Sync time="204.590"/>
they're normally not really fit for playing in ,
<Sync time="206.580"/>
or working , and things like that .
<Sync time="208.100"/>
so this basically requires low income students have extra sets of clothes .
<Sync time="211.810"/>
and even if their parents don't have to pay for them directly ,
<Sync time="214.400"/>
which they probably do in some areas ,
<Sync time="216.220"/>
but even if they don't ,
<Sync time="217.240"/>
this is just another big cost for the state to take on
<Sync time="219.870"/>
in providing education
<Sync time="221.160"/>
and we'd rather spend that money on other things instead .
<Sync time="223.955"/>

<Sync time="225.040"/>
so our second part of the speech
<Sync time="226.575"/>
is how we think that the alleged benefits are outweighed .
<Sync time="229.590"/>
even if uniforms
<Sync time="231.680"/>
offer some discipline in classrooms ,
<Sync time="233.630"/>
we don't think that this is unique to schools with uniforms .
<Sync time="236.430"/>
there are plenty of american or german schools where people don't wear uniforms and still have good classroom discipline .
<Sync time="241.815"/>
so we think that it's more important to instill discipline
<Sync time="244.520"/>
than to teach people that they have to wear a uniform .
<Sync time="247.110"/>
next ,
<Sync time="248.270"/>
even if uniforms remove some bullying they don't remove it all .
<Sync time="251.720"/>
we think that children are always going to be unkind to one another
<Sync time="254.630"/>
and requiring them to wear uniforms
<Sync time="256.550"/>
won't uniquely stop this
<Sync time="257.980"/>
or get rid of the problem .
<Sync time="259.570"/>

<Sync time="260.080"/>
and even if uniforms create some sense of unity within a school ,
<Sync time="263.410"/>
we think that there are still going to be lots of ways young people are excluded .
<Sync time="266.740"/>
we think that you're likely to see
<Sync time="268.045"/>
some people are popular and others aren't , we think you're likely see racism and bias and things like that remain ,
<Sync time="273.110"/>
so ultimately you're not going to create this strong sense of unity through using uniforms .
<Sync time="277.775"/>
so while certainly there are some benefits : you probably do get a little more discipline ,
<Sync time="281.865"/>
you probably do limit some bullying ,
<Sync time="283.605"/>
we think that the harms that we expressed earlier are more important than these concerns ,
<Sync time="287.510"/>
so we should ban school uniforms .
<Sync time="289.639"/>
