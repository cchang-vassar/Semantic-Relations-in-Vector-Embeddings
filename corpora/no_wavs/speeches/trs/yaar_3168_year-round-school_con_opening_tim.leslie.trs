we in opposition
<Sync time="1.500"/>
also believe that education is important ,
<Sync time="4.050"/>
but it is not all that matters when we talk about children .
<Sync time="7.000"/>
we think that side government
<Sync time="8.750"/>
is taking this way too far .
<Sync time="11.060"/>
they are treating children as if they are robots whose entire purpose is to sit down and and collect as much information as possible so that they could later on
<Sync time="20.700"/>
help promote society when they grow up .
<Sync time="23.420"/>
their entire line deals with how year-round schooling will lead to better students with better grades and how
<Sync time="29.720"/>
it's a shame to be wasting time , because we could have been
<Sync time="32.770"/>
been teaching children
<Sync time="34.350"/>
more stuff , or on how , god forbid ,
<Sync time="37.025"/>
some students will not be focused
<Sync time="38.995"/>
in class
<Sync time="40.160"/>
on there , like , a week before they go on vacation .
<Sync time="43.980"/>
we totally disagree that the metric th-
<Sync time="46.625"/>
by which this debate should be judged
<Sync time="48.900"/>
is
<Sync time="49.440"/>
only what leads to better education
<Sync time="52.100"/>
as if this is all that matters .
<Sync time="53.860"/>
because if this were the situation ,
<Sync time="56.095"/>
then why not offer that
<Sync time="58.225"/>
all children need to live in boarding schools
<Sync time="61.925"/>
and just study for seven
<Sync time="64.570"/>
uh for seven days a week ,
<Sync time="66.510"/>
fifteen hours a day ?
<Sync time="68.180"/>
this way we could have taught them even more ,
<Sync time="70.110"/>
but i think it's fairly obvious to all of us
<Sync time="73.030"/>
that this is wrong , and it's not just a matter of uh
<Sync time="76.065"/>
like how effective this would be .
<Sync time="78.110"/>
we assume that even if this would have been effective , even if we
<Sync time="81.310"/>
truly could have bee- been
<Sync time="83.170"/>
teaching children
<Sync time="84.520"/>
plenty more this way ,
<Sync time="86.000"/>
this would still be very , very wrong .
<Sync time="88.200"/>
this type of logic
<Sync time="89.610"/>
may have caught on
<Sync time="90.915"/>
in some communist country like china or s- soviet russia ,
<Sync time="95.020"/>
but it completely contradicts
<Sync time="96.870"/>
every set of beliefs
<Sync time="98.635"/>
that cherishes individual liberties .
<Sync time="101.735"/>

<Sync time="102.340"/>
so before i move to talk about the harms
<Sync time="104.990"/>
of
<Sync time="105.710"/>
um like implementing a system
<Sync time="108.210"/>
in which you only get
<Sync time="109.820"/>
one week off
<Sync time="111.280"/>
every
<Sync time="112.175"/>
every couple of months ,
<Sync time="113.770"/>
but there's no one big holiday ,
<Sync time="115.825"/>
it's important to note that side government
<Sync time="118.390"/>
grossly exaggerates
<Sync time="120.210"/>
when describing the harms
<Sync time="121.985"/>
in the status quo .
<Sync time="123.250"/>
they tell you that
<Sync time="124.160"/>
that students forget everything and have to be retaught
<Sync time="127.565"/>
from the start .
<Sync time="129.560"/>
first , we just think that that's exg- exaggerated . we say that studying
<Sync time="133.300"/>
and is l-
<Sync time="133.960"/>
is
<Sync time="134.385"/>
basically like riding a bicycle , it doesn't really take you a month
<Sync time="138.250"/>
to
<Sync time="138.835"/>
uh to to refresh yourself and relearn . you pick it up quite quickly
<Sync time="143.470"/>
after
<Sync time="144.020"/>
one lesson or maximum two lessons .
<Sync time="147.270"/>
b , this could
<Sync time="148.650"/>
this problem
<Sync time="149.650"/>
could easily be fixed
<Sync time="151.590"/>
or solved by handing
<Sync time="153.865"/>
assignments or homework for children
<Sync time="156.780"/>
uh that would have to tha- that they would have to prepare during their summer rica- ri- vacation in order to stay sharp .
<Sync time="163.230"/>
plenty of schools do this , and we have no problem with this .
<Sync time="166.890"/>
regarding
<Sync time="167.825"/>
like all the rest of their points , again ,
<Sync time="170.530"/>
the fact that we could have taught them more
<Sync time="172.760"/>
is always true ,
<Sync time="174.065"/>
but that's not how you win this debate , not without explaining why is this so crucial to be teaching children more and more and more stuff .
<Sync time="182.100"/>
so ,
<Sync time="182.640"/>
why do you th-
<Sync time="183.215"/>
why do we think that it's critical to allow a long summer vacation and we cannot
<Sync time="188.160"/>
uh just like d-
<Sync time="190.000"/>
we cannot just be happy with
<Sync time="191.750"/>
one week off here , one week off there .
<Sync time="194.370"/>
first of all , because we believe that
<Sync time="196.425"/>
this phase in life
<Sync time="198.760"/>
when you're a student
<Sync time="200.185"/>
is quite reasonably
<Sync time="201.925"/>
the last
<Sync time="203.650"/>
um like part of your life
<Sync time="206.070"/>
where you get to have such a long vacation .
<Sync time="209.070"/>
most people graduate and then they find some sort of job ,
<Sync time="212.445"/>
and they will
<Sync time="213.350"/>
like have an entire lifetime to be working year round , with short vacations here and there .
<Sync time="219.620"/>
but this experience in which you now have
<Sync time="222.440"/>
a full month or two months
<Sync time="224.390"/>
to just do whatever you feel like
<Sync time="226.590"/>
is precious and priceless , and u-
<Sync time="229.290"/>
we think that it would be a huge shame to be taking away from people
<Sync time="233.670"/>
the very few times in which they do get to have this ,
<Sync time="236.925"/>

<Sync time="237.570"/>
people that will
<Sync time="238.920"/>
anyway have an entire lifetime to
<Sync time="241.985"/>
develop a consistent
<Sync time="244.260"/>
pattern , as they tell us , or a
<Sync time="246.040"/>
boring routine , the way we would call it .
<Sync time="248.600"/>

<Sync time="249.180"/>
second of all , we think that
<Sync time="251.325"/>
one week
<Sync time="252.210"/>
vacation is just not enough time to be doing a lot of things , like going traveling to a to a foreign country with your family for more than a couple of days or going to a summer camp where you get to meet a lot of friends outside of your school .
<Sync time="264.230"/>
where else would you get
<Sync time="265.490"/>
the chance to do something like this
<Sync time="267.505"/>
if you were learning all year round ? these are experiences
<Sync time="270.770"/>
that
<Sync time="271.460"/>
are just as enriching , if not more ,
<Sync time="274.360"/>
than sitting in class and multiplying numbers . there's more to life than the four walls of your classroom , and there is no better time to go out and explore everything than when you are young student . we call you
<Sync time="284.365"/>
to oppose .
<Sync time="285.439"/>
