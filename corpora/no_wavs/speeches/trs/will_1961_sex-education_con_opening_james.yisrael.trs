i'm proud to oppose the motion
<Sync time="2.155"/>
that we should make sex education
<Sync time="4.240"/>
mandatory .
<Sync time="5.370"/>
our first independent point
<Sync time="7.115"/>
is that this will likely lead to worse
<Sync time="9.480"/>
sex education .
<Sync time="10.960"/>
so we want to consider for a moment
<Sync time="13.010"/>
um the landscape of the schools that
<Sync time="16.015"/>
have sex education .
<Sync time="18.320"/>
largely these are schools in fairly liberal areas that are more you know tolerant of these types of things like teenage sexuality
<Sync time="25.975"/>
or they're in states that even that are more liberal so even in like say a conservative area like upstate new york
<Sync time="32.540"/>
that might be reluctant to have sex education
<Sync time="35.720"/>
there's like a liberal state government that is going to mandate that sex education .
<Sync time="40.065"/>
i think then the problem is that when you're talking about increasing the number of locations that have mandatory sex education
<Sync time="47.225"/>
you're necessarily talking about the types of places that reject it wholesale in the status quo .
<Sync time="53.010"/>
so really conservative rural areas like say texas maybe or in alabama
<Sync time="59.180"/>
like a lot of the deep south really
<Sync time="61.165"/>
is what you're looking at in this kind of cross section .
<Sync time="64.920"/>
the problem then with mandating sex education
<Sync time="67.990"/>
without putting specific requirements on what constitutes sex education
<Sync time="72.210"/>
is two fold .
<Sync time="73.395"/>
first
<Sync time="74.375"/>
you have a system of that um
<Sync time="76.440"/>
is likely to result in either a
<Sync time="79.400"/>
bad practices being taught so like for example they just
<Sync time="83.075"/>
force some hapless gym teacher in there that
<Sync time="85.590"/>
you know it's such as like this guy that doesn't understand how the pill works
<Sync time="89.455"/>
and so they give
<Sync time="90.190"/>
actively bad advice that actually increases problematic
<Sync time="94.320"/>
ah sex you know like activities
<Sync time="96.735"/>
and doesn't actually educate people properly .
<Sync time="99.930"/>
or secondly
<Sync time="101.025"/>
they have larger structures that are
<Sync time="103.080"/>
you know structurally harmful like abstinence only sex education which statistically
<Sync time="107.790"/>
increases teen pregnancy and s_t_d rates .
<Sync time="111.230"/>
um
<Sync time="112.040"/>
so at the point where you have these
<Sync time="114.245"/>
this counter factual this is the type of system that's going to be set up in these regions that don't already have sex education
<Sync time="121.405"/>
i think the problem the question then
<Sync time="123.515"/>
becomes is this bad sex education
<Sync time="126.340"/>
worse than no sex education . i think the answer is yes for two reasons .
<Sync time="130.705"/>
first
<Sync time="131.600"/>
in the status quo
<Sync time="132.820"/>
even in a hyper conservative area
<Sync time="134.830"/>
there are children that are still going to get access to good sex education
<Sync time="138.440"/>
without it being present in the schools
<Sync time="140.490"/>
because they grow up in families that are more tolerant of these issues
<Sync time="143.770"/>
and as such they'll learn about these things in the household .
<Sync time="146.450"/>
but having sex education that pushes bad badly informed norms
<Sync time="151.590"/>
directly counters what they're learning in the household then
<Sync time="154.635"/>
and as such the only children that are likely to get proper education on these issues are now having their education
<Sync time="160.540"/>
distorted .
<Sync time="161.430"/>
but secondly we think there's an issue because a lot of the practices themselves
<Sync time="165.880"/>
are necessarily harmful that
<Sync time="168.050"/>
abstinence only sex education for example
<Sync time="170.985"/>
creates disillusionment on the student body .
<Sync time="173.790"/>
this is by dare for example the like notorious over the top
<Sync time="177.650"/>
ah like drug awareness program
<Sync time="180.060"/>
actually increase drug usage rates
<Sync time="182.375"/>
because it creates disillusionment with authority structures in the school .
<Sync time="186.940"/>
even if government cri- tries to tell you then
<Sync time="189.420"/>
that like the state mandating the system
<Sync time="191.825"/>
can just create like a good system
<Sync time="194.680"/>
the problem is that in the status quo the states that don't have mandatory sex education
<Sync time="199.360"/>
are the same states that are likely to actually mandate
<Sync time="202.530"/>
these problematic forms of sex education .
<Sync time="205.530"/>
texas for example if forced to mandate sex ed for all of its high schools
<Sync time="209.960"/>
would probably say that it has to be
<Sync time="211.720"/>
abstinence only this then again
<Sync time="214.130"/>
increases the proliferation of harmful norms .
<Sync time="216.960"/>
our second in a point to prov-
<Sync time="218.410"/>
pending point briefly is parental rights . we think that
<Sync time="220.900"/>
parents are the best proxy for young children on the basis of that the
<Sync time="223.955"/>
children themselves aren't capable of performing informed consent when they're at such a young age
<Sync time="228.980"/>
and as such the parent has the best interests of the child in mind because the child can't make these decisions for themselves .
<Sync time="234.800"/>
at that point then if there are parents that don't want their kids to receive sex education 
<Sync time="238.960"/>
we believe that they and not the state have the better information on what is and isn't right for their child . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="245.580"/>
