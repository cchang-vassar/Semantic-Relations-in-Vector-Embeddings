we should not further exploit unconventional oil . 
<Sync time="3.595"/>
we think that in the status quo there are many avenues
<Sync time="6.590"/>
of clean energy that are being developed
<Sync time="7.720"/>
and other opportunities that we think
<Sync time="9.990"/>
unconventional oil simply crowds out
<Sync time="12.270"/>
and that we think is unnecessary .
<Sync time="14.280"/>
so we're going to talk about two main things . we're going to
<Sync time="16.420"/>
talk about why unconventional oil is simply bad for the environment , and why that 
<Sync time="19.620"/>
matters more than anything else ,
<Sync time="21.230"/>
and then we're going to talk about
<Sync time="22.730"/>
alternative methods of getting energy
<Sync time="25.095"/>
and why those are preferable .
<Sync time="26.700"/>
okay so recognize that
<Sync time="28.000"/>
alternate methods of oil are the least clean ways
<Sync time="30.910"/>
of extracting oil .
<Sync time="31.555"/>
going to things like
<Sync time="32.905"/>
sands and using fracking are both incredibly difficult in the status quo , which means the method of the
<Sync time="38.100"/>
of extraction
<Sync time="39.490"/>
both
<Sync time="39.965"/>
requires the use of energy in order to extract at a higher rate than other types of energy extraction ,
<Sync time="45.195"/>
but also
<Sync time="46.020"/>
have the most impact on local ecology . you need to do drilling , you need to do types of things
<Sync time="50.565"/>
that ruin the habitats
<Sync time="52.065"/>
of animals that exist in these areas ,
<Sync time="53.840"/>
oftentimes in areas that have already been decimated
<Sync time="56.120"/>
by the impacts of climate change . so what are the two impacts
<Sync time="59.015"/>
of these bad things ?
<Sync time="60.150"/>
first it destroys local ecosystems .
<Sync time="62.180"/>
when you destroy local ecosystems
<Sync time="63.920"/>
we think that there are massive
<Sync time="65.085"/>
long term ramifications in the area .
<Sync time="67.650"/>
if you desolate an ecosystem and if you desolate
<Sync time="69.380"/>
a habitat
<Sync time="70.710"/>
uh it means that many species can be put at risk , it means that the entire environment of the area
<Sync time="75.730"/>
could change , which could have ramifications on every-
<Sync time="77.825"/>
on everything from agriculture in the area ,
<Sync time="80.150"/>
to weather in the area ,
<Sync time="81.370"/>
to basically people's
<Sync time="82.960"/>
uh standard of living in these areas .
<Sync time="84.760"/>
we don't think that this is worth it , uh
<Sync time="86.860"/>
to extract more dirty energy . the other thing that can happen ,
<Sync time="89.215"/>
which often happens ,
<Sync time="90.920"/>
uh especially with methods like fracking , is uh
<Sync time="93.845"/>
uh polluting the water supply .
<Sync time="95.860"/>
when you pollute a water supply , especially
<Sync time="97.745"/>
in some areas that are simply
<Sync time="99.510"/>
already at risk of losing water at losing
<Sync time="102.395"/>
uh access to clean water , especially with global warming decreasing the level of access to clean water
<Sync time="107.850"/>
across the globe ,
<Sync time="109.080"/>
we think that what's likely to happen is that the people in these {area/areas}
<Sync time="111.625"/>
are going to suffer because of un-
<Sync time="113.385"/>
because of unconventional oil . it
<Sync time="115.160"/>
means their access to clean water goes down ,
<Sync time="117.280"/>
and this is a basic necessity that these people need
<Sync time="119.865"/>
in order
<Sync time="120.730"/>
for uh
<Sync time="121.490"/>
their survival . and we don't think
<Sync time="123.280"/>
uh that
<Sync time="124.300"/>
it's necessary to adopt these types of m-
<Sync time="126.945"/>
uh these types
<Sync time="128.330"/>
of energy . we simply think that
<Sync time="130.205"/>
in the status quo we are on the path that is unsustainable .
<Sync time="133.340"/>
that global warming
<Sync time="134.410"/>
is an inevitability
<Sync time="135.810"/>
that we need to try and stop right now before you reach a further tipping point . we think that
<Sync time="140.780"/>
even if you are able to get unconventional oil in a clean way , even if you're able to do it without destroying ecosystems ,
<Sync time="146.600"/>
you're only adding to the problem in the
<Sync time="148.090"/>
status quo . you're only allowing for more dirty energy to be produced ,
<Sync time="151.760"/>
which we think is unacce- is unacceptable ,
<Sync time="154.240"/>
and is only going to lead
<Sync time="155.455"/>
to dramatic harms for the future of society for future people
<Sync time="158.915"/>
and even for people in the status quo .
<Sync time="160.770"/>
we think that this isn't worth it ,
<Sync time="162.040"/>
especially given the alternatives that exist .
<Sync time="164.450"/>
so recognize that alternative clean methods of
<Sync time="167.060"/>
energy are becoming incredibly and increasingly cheap
<Sync time="170.330"/>
and viable . things like solar wind
<Sync time="173.075"/>
and hydro technology are becoming more and more efficient
<Sync time="175.890"/>
every year , and as they become more efficient these methods
<Sync time="178.480"/>
also become cheaper , which is why we've seen the rise
<Sync time="180.800"/>
in solar technology not just in the united states but also in
<Sync time="183.920"/>
more developing nations like china , because it's becoming even more efficient and
<Sync time="187.550"/>
even more worthwhile to
<Sync time="189.070"/>
use .
<Sync time="190.210"/>
given that these other methods of technology exist
<Sync time="192.630"/>
and that even if they may be expensive in the status quo ,
<Sync time="195.430"/>
there are also avenues for more innovation .
<Sync time="197.400"/>
the innovation surrounding
<Sync time="198.665"/>
green technology , surrounding things like wind and solar energy ,
<Sync time="202.060"/>
are simply
<Sync time="202.775"/>
more innovative than
<Sync time="203.990"/>
using oil . using the same energy methods that we've been using
<Sync time="206.975"/>
for the past hundred years . for
<Sync time="208.610"/>
the past two hundred years .
<Sync time="209.795"/>
we think that when you subs-
<Sync time="211.240"/>
even if it means you need to subsidize these other
<Sync time="213.490"/>
type of energies ,
<Sync time="214.545"/>
it means you're likely to get more innovation
<Sync time="216.385"/>
and you're guaranteed not to increase pollution .
<Sync time="218.835"/>
not only are these energies very useful 
<Sync time="220.910"/>
for emissions rates that they lower c_o_2 emissions , but they're also
<Sync time="224.485"/>
really environmentally friendly for local habitats .
<Sync time="227.100"/>
you don't need to destroy an entire ecosystem
<Sync time="229.400"/>
in order to collect sunlight
<Sync time="230.860"/>
or wind from a certain area .
<Sync time="232.620"/>
given that these clean technologies are increasingly becoming efficient ,
<Sync time="235.520"/>
we simply do not think it is necessary ,
<Sync time="237.930"/>
nor do we think it is worthwhile ,
<Sync time="239.650"/>
to exploit further
<Sync time="240.990"/>
unconventional oil . we think that we would rather
<Sync time="243.465"/>
use methods that aren't going to do in the future of our planet , that aren't going to doom
<Sync time="247.330"/>
future societies ,
<Sync time="248.500"/>
and for these reasons we should not further exploit
<Sync time="251.510"/>
unconventional oil .
<Sync time="252.980"/>

<Sync time="253.835"/>
