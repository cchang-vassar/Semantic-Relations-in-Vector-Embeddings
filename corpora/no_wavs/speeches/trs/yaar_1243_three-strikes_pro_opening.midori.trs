fool me once shame on you . fool me twice shame on me .
<Sync time="3.610"/>
for me three times
<Sync time="4.940"/>
double shame on me .
<Sync time="6.150"/>
we say that if the state was {insuccessful/unsuccessful} in rehabilitating someone after giving it two shots already ,
<Sync time="11.760"/>
then his third offense is just as much the state's fault
<Sync time="14.975"/>
as it is his own ,
<Sync time="16.010"/>
and it's unfair and unreasonable to have him suffer all the consequences and all the blame .
<Sync time="21.380"/>
two arguments in this speech :
<Sync time="23.130"/>
first ,
<Sync time="23.790"/>
why this proposition
<Sync time="25.480"/>
disproportionately targets and harms disenfranchised groups
<Sync time="29.025"/>
and b ,
<Sync time="29.805"/>
why this would prove ineffective an ineffective tool in creating deterrence rendering the three strike system both unjustified
<Sync time="36.695"/>
and unsuccessful at what it's trying to achieve .
<Sync time="39.650"/>
so first argument ,
<Sync time="40.970"/>
all over the world
<Sync time="42.140"/>
prisons
<Sync time="42.925"/>
are
<Sync time="43.455"/>
disproportionately filled with minority population .
<Sync time="46.400"/>
this correlation gets even stronger when it comes to re-offenders .
<Sync time="49.620"/>
so it's immediately clear to us that these groups are going to be affected from this proposition most of all .
<Sync time="55.410"/>
but why is that ?
<Sync time="56.480"/>
we say that there are three reasons . firstly ,
<Sync time="59.365"/>
necessity .
<Sync time="60.435"/>
when i literally have no other option , when all else fails and i need to bring food to the table somehow ,
<Sync time="65.940"/>
then i'll resort to stealing money or stealing food .
<Sync time="68.830"/>
secondly ,
<Sync time="69.585"/>
neglect from the government and society .
<Sync time="72.180"/>
if i grew up in a poor neighborhood where all the buildings are ugly and all the schools are shitty
<Sync time="77.015"/>
and i look around and see
<Sync time="78.760"/>
neighboring areas that have it way better than me ,
<Sync time="81.550"/>
i can't help but feel
<Sync time="83.255"/>
left behind . and i start asking myself , why should i abide by the rules ?
<Sync time="87.580"/>
they don't have my back , why should i answer to them ?
<Sync time="91.010"/>
and
<Sync time="91.455"/>
thirdly , and most unfortunate reason ,
<Sync time="93.830"/>
is profiling and biased
<Sync time="95.790"/>
treatment of the
<Sync time="97.025"/>
law authorities .
<Sync time="98.120"/>
minority populations suffer from
<Sync time="100.090"/>
more suspicion in the court systems
<Sync time="102.190"/>
or police officers patrolling their streets performing random arrests and so on .
<Sync time="106.910"/>
this obviously leads directly to more arrests , but also indirectly
<Sync time="111.210"/>
tips into
<Sync time="112.235"/>
this distrust
<Sync time="113.435"/>
in the system that we've mentioned and creates more crime in an indirect way .
<Sync time="117.685"/>
so
<Sync time="118.330"/>
this is a cycle that feeds itself .
<Sync time="120.830"/>
these are all things that don't change after you get locked up .
<Sync time="124.200"/>
notice , when you return to your neighborhood ,
<Sync time="126.250"/>
if anything ,
<Sync time="127.270"/>
they get changed for the worse .
<Sync time="129.680"/>
your financial situation might be worse than before , your resentment for society might be bigger ,
<Sync time="134.530"/>
so
<Sync time="135.335"/>
we see that crime in general ,
<Sync time="138.000"/>
and recurring crime specifically ,
<Sync time="140.520"/>
isn't a consequence of
<Sync time="141.810"/>
sociopaths as it's so convenient for us to believe ,
<Sync time="145.180"/>
but of ongoing institutional failures
<Sync time="147.950"/>
that we all have a part in . 
<Sync time="150.000"/>
therefore we say that society has a contributory guilt in this
<Sync time="154.065"/>
and as such it is impossible to offer a solution
<Sync time="157.500"/>
of giving up on these people , declaring them a lost cause and locking them up forever .
<Sync time="163.130"/>
the only fair solution would require understanding
<Sync time="166.170"/>
that these are people with true hardships that the system
<Sync time="168.950"/>
overlooked and we really need to pay attention to .
<Sync time="171.740"/>
we can attach parole officers , we can send more social workers ,
<Sync time="175.130"/>
etcetera .
<Sync time="175.740"/>
it is so convenient for the well off majority to simply tag criminals as monsters
<Sync time="180.410"/>
and lock them up
<Sync time="181.510"/>
lock them away from us
<Sync time="183.020"/>
and feel more secure .
<Sync time="184.420"/>
but these are real people whose lives are being destroyed here .
<Sync time="187.290"/>
they're s- they're somebody's son .
<Sync time="189.335"/>
it's unfair and unjust .
<Sync time="191.610"/>
let's move on to talk about why deterrence doesn't work .
<Sync time="194.345"/>
let's clarify something : this debate is not about murder or rape ,
<Sync time="197.770"/>
but rather theft and robbery .
<Sync time="199.510"/>
why ?
<Sync time="199.995"/>
because
<Sync time="200.600"/>
if you're caught raping or murdering , then the punishment is usually very long , so a third offense is less likely .
<Sync time="205.950"/>
so opposition might say , you know what ?
<Sync time="208.150"/>
we're more obligated to innocent people than people who committed crimes time and again
<Sync time="212.070"/>
and
<Sync time="212.710"/>
this helps deter crime and keeps people safe so we should do it .
<Sync time="216.510"/>
this entire idea assumes that these crimes are a consequence of pure rational judgment .
<Sync time="221.620"/>
is if people calculate the probabilities and weigh pros and cons . 
<Sync time="225.615"/>
but we say that this doesn't work in cases of crimes
<Sync time="228.445"/>
that are due to lack of options , and as we saw specifically for re offenders ,
<Sync time="232.810"/>
robbery theft are exactly such crime .
<Sync time="235.580"/>
moreover we think that the clear message
<Sync time="237.765"/>
to these communities ,
<Sync time="238.980"/>
if this law passes ,
<Sync time="240.180"/>
is
<Sync time="240.595"/>
that the state finally gave up on them for good .
<Sync time="243.450"/>
the state that always like we always knew that the state doesn't really give a damn about us ,
<Sync time="248.070"/>
now it doesn't even see us as human beings anymore .
<Sync time="250.850"/>
this only enhances the hatred
<Sync time="252.770"/>
that they feel and the chances for more crime .
<Sync time="255.480"/>
kids have to see their father getting locked up for life for trying to get them a new pair of bikes .
<Sync time="260.120"/>
how can they ever be expected to show respect for the police ?
<Sync time="263.520"/>
so maybe we put one dangerous person off the street ,
<Sync time="266.240"/>
but at that very moment we created three more potentially dangerous people .
<Sync time="270.480"/>
so for all of these reasons
<Sync time="271.880"/>
please propose .
<Sync time="273.684"/>
