<Sync time="0.780"/>
the motion for this debate is that we should ban boxing .
<Sync time="4.325"/>
um
<Sync time="5.100"/>
two main areas of clash : the first on the danger to competitors .
<Sync time="9.240"/>
we think that you need to paternalize boxers
<Sync time="11.840"/>
from being able to participate in this 
<Sync time="13.680"/>
and like children who are thinking of being boxers 
<Sync time="16.125"/>
from participating in this activity
<Sync time="17.980"/>
because society glamorize athletics and physical strength
<Sync time="21.035"/>
and oftentimes especially for boys
<Sync time="23.100"/>
glamorizes the associated violence and the associated
<Sync time="26.240"/>
domination that occurs during boxing .
<Sync time="28.880"/>
so
<Sync time="29.785"/>
at the point that we don't think that people can resist the societal impulses on their own ,
<Sync time="34.680"/>
we think it is necessary for the government to step in
<Sync time="37.145"/>
and say
<Sync time="38.370"/>
look this is too dangerous
<Sync time="40.420"/>
here are the reasons why we are not allowing it anymore .
<Sync time="43.020"/>

<Sync time="43.610"/>
so first into this is that athletes have a very short shelf life .
<Sync time="47.280"/>
so after about ten years their bodies begin to give out
<Sync time="50.300"/>
but because they've dedicated so much of their lives to this activity 
<Sync time="53.610"/>
there really isn't anything else for them to do .
<Sync time="55.770"/>
so what happens is that
<Sync time="57.420"/>
you basically have someone who spent a solid twenty years of their lives
<Sync time="61.190"/>
training for this activity , becoming a professional boxer ,
<Sync time="64.125"/>
spent
<Sync time="64.670"/>
six years
<Sync time="65.760"/>
in the boxing ring , and then after that has no more marketable skills
<Sync time="69.400"/>
because physically they can't do anything
<Sync time="71.220"/>
but also all the time that they spent training in the gym
<Sync time="74.200"/>
was time they didn't spend learning a different marketable skill .
<Sync time="77.420"/>
this means that you actually end up with people
<Sync time="79.505"/>
who used to be athletes who end up below the poverty line afterwards
<Sync time="83.350"/>
because they never actually had a real living that they made
<Sync time="86.630"/>
besides being an athlete .
<Sync time="88.850"/>
more than this though we think that physically boxing is incredibly dangerous .
<Sync time="93.390"/>
it's the only sport that really involves
<Sync time="95.585"/>
a accepted and endorsed physical contact through fists .
<Sync time="99.930"/>
recognize that in every other sport such as
<Sync time="102.390"/>
soccer or basketball there are fouls for elbowing your opponents .
<Sync time="106.200"/>
b- a b- boxing gets rid of all of that
<Sync time="108.500"/>
and says go for it .
<Sync time="109.960"/>
so you end up with way more broken noses , limbs , necks ,
<Sync time="113.205"/>
and it's also the only spo-
<Sync time="114.670"/>
sport with a significant death count
<Sync time="117.220"/>
based on one
<Sync time="118.460"/>
on impact blow .
<Sync time="119.800"/>
so something like thirty people a year die based on one punch in the boxing ring 
<Sync time="125.390"/>
and many more than that
<Sync time="126.900"/>
die in the boxing ring
<Sync time="128.080"/>
holistically
<Sync time="129.140"/>
from more than one punch .
<Sync time="131.020"/>
specifically the use of boxing gloves
<Sync time="132.850"/>
worsens the situation because the large surface area
<Sync time="136.000"/>
carries the same initial force as if i was to just punch something
<Sync time="139.430"/>
but becomes more harmful
<Sync time="141.160"/>
because of the surface area it covers .
<Sync time="143.125"/>
so it literally jiggles the brain
<Sync time="145.640"/>
by making contacts with more points on your head .
<Sync time="148.640"/>
we think that at the point that participants end up with
<Sync time="150.925"/>
long term physical and mental health problems ,
<Sync time="153.265"/>
that they could not have accounted for ,
<Sync time="154.980"/>
that last far beyond their boxing careers ,
<Sync time="157.410"/>
and end up costing much more than their boxing careers
<Sync time="160.020"/>
ever afforded them ,
<Sync time="161.195"/>
and they shorten these people's lifespan ,
<Sync time="163.360"/>
it is then
<Sync time="163.900"/>
okay for us to paternalize them . 
<Sync time="166.400"/>
but our secondary of clash
<Sync time="167.840"/>
has to do with why it's bad for society .
<Sync time="169.780"/>
we want to talk about why it propagates violent culture .
<Sync time="172.640"/>
because when you watch violence you're essentially normalizing
<Sync time="176.255"/>
what like what you are looking at , right ?
<Sync time="178.560"/>
so
<Sync time="178.910"/>
if every day i spend my time
<Sync time="180.820"/>
watching people beat each other up
<Sync time="182.660"/>
i get less surprised the next time it occurs in front of me because it has become
<Sync time="186.710"/>
so expected .
<Sync time="187.715"/>
so in the bobo doll experiment
<Sync time="190.470"/>
run by skinner , what he did was put p- put children in a room with a t_v where they watched a man beat up a doll
<Sync time="196.270"/>
and later they were much more likely
<Sync time="197.950"/>
to mimic this behavior .
<Sync time="199.440"/>
we think the same thing occurs when you're watching violent sports such as boxing
<Sync time="202.995"/>
because
<Sync time="203.760"/>
when you are a child who's
<Sync time="205.650"/>
looking at a role models and you're sitting down and you're seeing these big strong men who you aspire to be 
<Sync time="210.875"/>
beating each other up ,
<Sync time="212.150"/>
you're much more likely to go back and mimic this behavior later .
<Sync time="215.465"/>
we think that there's an additional layer of harm though , at the point that it turns this activity
<Sync time="219.790"/>
into entertainment .
<Sync time="221.500"/>
in order to maintain people
<Sync time="223.875"/>
feeling serious about violence , you need to keep a serious aura around it .
<Sync time="228.420"/>
so if you make violence into entertainment ,
<Sync time="230.590"/>
you're more likely to end up in situations where people find violence comical
<Sync time="234.200"/>
and are not actually going to act against it .
<Sync time="237.420"/>
and we think that
<Sync time="238.505"/>
that boxing is specifically unique in this
<Sync time="240.795"/>
because it doesn't have a second layer to the sport .
<Sync time="243.740"/>
there isn't
<Sync time="244.370"/>
a second goal where you're supposed to kick the ball in ,
<Sync time="246.810"/>
it is completely based on just beating other people up .
<Sync time="249.740"/>
for these reasons proud to oppose .
<Sync time="251.990"/>
propose .
<Sync time="253.035"/>

<Sync time="253.700"/>
