we should ban gambling .
<Sync time="2.260"/>
we believe that
<Sync time="3.150"/>
true liberty means
<Sync time="4.460"/>
independence .
<Sync time="5.360"/>
it's having control over the basic course of your life .
<Sync time="8.615"/>
to have this control stripped from you ,
<Sync time="11.130"/>
is to be robbed of your liberty ,
<Sync time="12.965"/>
and we mustn't let that happen .
<Sync time="15.070"/>
surely , almost every decision in
<Sync time="16.890"/>
life can have unpredictable outcome , so let's be crystal clear :
<Sync time="20.470"/>
we're in favor of banning every activity , in which you gamble
<Sync time="24.130"/>
purely on conditions that you have no control or knowledge
<Sync time="27.290"/>
over . this means no more roulettes ,
<Sync time="29.640"/>
or slot machines ,
<Sync time="30.845"/>
and with regard to card games , such as poker ,
<Sync time="34.070"/>
this is arguably something that you can control by having some skill ,
<Sync time="38.605"/>
so we're going to leave that question open . we don't think that it harms in any way the principle that we defend
<Sync time="44.750"/>
in this debate .
<Sync time="46.110"/>
so ,
<Sync time="46.725"/>
obviously were also talking strictly about
<Sync time="50.480"/>
activities where significant sums of money
<Sync time="52.990"/>
are involved .
<Sync time="54.380"/>
so , we're going to have two arguments in this speech :
<Sync time="57.120"/>
one , on
<Sync time="58.110"/>
when are we allowed to protect you from yourself ,
<Sync time="61.065"/>
and
<Sync time="61.630"/>
second , on some
<Sync time="63.200"/>
practical effects of banning
<Sync time="64.990"/>
gambling .
<Sync time="66.280"/>
first argument :
<Sync time="67.345"/>
like with any other thing 
<Sync time="69.300"/>
we're banning , this is restricting people from doing certain things that they might want to do .
<Sync time="74.390"/>
if they're not harming anyone else , why is it okay for us to intervene ?
<Sync time="78.720"/>
the answer here is that gambling is highly addictive ,
<Sync time="82.560"/>
as the huge number of compulsive gamblers can attest to .
<Sync time="86.180"/>
and because it is by definition something that you have no control over ,
<Sync time="90.080"/>
at the point in which you get addicted , you can easily reach a stage where you lose all control over your life ,
<Sync time="96.170"/>
therefore in this case , much like
<Sync time="98.190"/>
all sorts of very addictive narcotics ,
<Sync time="100.750"/>
it is permissible to intervene
<Sync time="102.685"/>
and the only way to do that is to try and cut it
<Sync time="105.690"/>
at its root , because once you're in it ,
<Sync time="107.820"/>
it's probably too late .
<Sync time="109.660"/>
what's more ,
<Sync time="110.525"/>
it's usually the weakest , most poorest , that find themselves addicted to gambling .
<Sync time="115.440"/>
why ? because
<Sync time="116.580"/>
where wealthy gamblers see casinos as a fun , amusing , outdoor activity ,
<Sync time="121.325"/>
for the less well off it's often considered their rescue wheel , their ticket out of poverty ,
<Sync time="126.435"/>
and so they end up spending much more , and
<Sync time="128.870"/>
getting sucked in 
<Sync time="130.020"/>
due to this ,
<Sync time="130.650"/>
unfortunately ,
<Sync time="131.650"/>
false hope .
<Sync time="132.870"/>
these people are sometimes not educated enough , or otherwise just too enchanted by the thought of suddenly becoming rich ,
<Sync time="139.640"/>
that
<Sync time="139.985"/>
they're unable to fully realize how {scars/scarce} their chances of success really are .
<Sync time="144.795"/>
these are the people that casinos are targeting ,
<Sync time="147.310"/>
because they know they'll be able to squeeze a lot of money out of-
<Sync time="150.440"/>
out of them .
<Sync time="151.750"/>
so essentially , we say that this is a lot like fraud , or false advertising , and this is all the more reason to protect our citizens , even at the expense of forbidding then something they might want
<Sync time="160.855"/>
to do .
<Sync time="161.715"/>
and of course , it's not only the gamblers themselves that end up getting hurt ,
<Sync time="165.490"/>
but also their families , seeing as many compulsive gamblers
<Sync time="168.710"/>
end up
<Sync time="169.270"/>
mortgaging their properties , or otherwise grossly indebted ,
<Sync time="172.650"/>
ruining their families
<Sync time="174.305"/>
to no fault of their own , and
<Sync time="176.200"/>
so by banning gambling , we're helping
<Sync time="178.540"/>
them as well . it's not only harm to your own self .
<Sync time="182.240"/>
second argument :
<Sync time="183.500"/>
moving on to some of the practical effects of
<Sync time="185.990"/>
this ban .
<Sync time="186.745"/>
so opposition often say : listen , if
<Sync time="188.870"/>
we ban gambling ,
<Sync time="189.990"/>
than a black market will develop , that will involve all sorts of other illegal activities , and all sorts of criminal types , which will make the gamblers' lives
<Sync time="197.630"/>
much more complicated .
<Sync time="199.470"/>
legalizing gambling helps us superviso and
<Sync time="202.880"/>
protect gamblers , and so on and so on .
<Sync time="205.330"/>
so here's our response :
<Sync time="207.060"/>
black markets never actually go away just by legalizing the thing that they're
<Sync time="211.870"/>
dealing in .
<Sync time="212.655"/>
they can very much coexist alongside the legal market .
<Sync time="216.430"/>
if we legalize gambling ,
<Sync time="218.150"/>
it's-
<Sync time="218.780"/>
it-
<Sync time="219.200"/>
it will become much more accessible to many more people , who would be duped into the world of gambling , and end up in the black market
<Sync time="226.610"/>
anyway ,
<Sync time="227.380"/>
pawning their cars and houses , because the accumulated debts
<Sync time="230.730"/>
that they have no other way of
<Sync time="232.650"/>
paying .
<Sync time="233.240"/>
and so ,
<Sync time="233.975"/>
in this particular example ,
<Sync time="235.715"/>
we think that the legal market would just intensify the black market ,
<Sync time="239.745"/>
and it's preferable to ban it ,
<Sync time="242.485"/>
and try and deal with the small black market that exists today ,
<Sync time="246.675"/>
and as sadly , always has and always will . and for all of these reasons ,
<Sync time="252.705"/>
we are very glad to propose .
<Sync time="254.820"/>
