we should legalize cannabis for many many reasons .
<Sync time="5.520"/>
so ,
<Sync time="6.145"/>
first let's talk about how we're going to legalize it .
<Sync time="8.700"/>
this isn't going to be just medical , this is going to be everything -
<Sync time="11.610"/>
medical and recreational .
<Sync time="13.210"/>
in addition to it being fully legalized ,
<Sync time="15.455"/>
anyone who was imprisoned , is currently serving a prison sentence ,
<Sync time="19.320"/>
for any kind of marijuana related offense
<Sync time="21.700"/>
should immediately be released .
<Sync time="23.640"/>
further , anyone , regardless of if they're currently in prison , or one served ,
<Sync time="27.890"/>
should have their record entirely expunged ,
<Sync time="30.710"/>
uh so- and all of their rights restored , if that is their only offense .
<Sync time="34.730"/>
additionally , the state should also pay
<Sync time="37.260"/>
restitution for all the damages and lives that they took away ,
<Sync time="40.690"/>
because of the f- the uh war on drugs
<Sync time="42.910"/>
they precipitated .
<Sync time="43.725"/>
so ,
<Sync time="44.475"/>
why are all these things necessary and just ?
<Sync time="47.045"/>
so ,
<Sync time="47.760"/>
first let's talk about
<Sync time="49.565"/>
rights that people have .
<Sync time="50.875"/>
i think that at its core , the state doesn't have the right to say that people can't smoke cannabis ,
<Sync time="56.105"/>
i don't
<Sync time="56.770"/>
or do whatever they want with weed .
<Sync time="59.300"/>
so , why do i think this is true ?
<Sync time="61.140"/>
keep in mind that ,
<Sync time="62.420"/>
there's a lot of different ways that individuals can choose to live their lives ,
<Sync time="65.885"/>
and if somebody wants to get high , because they enjoy the benefits of it ,
<Sync time="69.960"/>
because they think that it makes-
<Sync time="71.460"/>
maybe it makes food taste a little bit better ,
<Sync time="73.520"/>
maybe they- it makes sex a little bit better ,
<Sync time="76.120"/>
maybe it relaxes them a little bit more ,
<Sync time="78.330"/>
their stress if- if
<Sync time="79.400"/>
they're like stressed ,
<Sync time="80.435"/>
maybe it can do- it can do anything , like things like that .
<Sync time="83.205"/>
those are incredibly reasonable decisions that people can make ,
<Sync time="86.255"/>
if they choose to do so .
<Sync time="87.560"/>
in the same way that people use alcohol for social lubrications , or you can have a glass of wine after dinner to de-stress or things like that ,
<Sync time="95.310"/>
or smoke a cigarette , these are all things that we accept , because we accept that people have a right to make these choices with their body ,
<Sync time="101.870"/>
but more specifically , they have the choice to make this body
<Sync time="104.680"/>
uh
<Sync time="105.155"/>
things that affect their own internal mental processes ,
<Sync time="108.235"/>
especially when they don't affect other people in any kind of harmful way , because all of the effects of marijuana
<Sync time="113.550"/>
are limited to the individual self .
<Sync time="115.725"/>
so ,
<Sync time="117.085"/>

<Sync time="117.665"/>
additionally , i also think it is important , because there's been absolutely no efficacy to the war on drugs
<Sync time="123.150"/>
whatsoever .
<Sync time="124.330"/>
uh it {is/has} accomplished nothing uh .
<Sync time="126.640"/>
it has not led to
<Sync time="128.115"/>
less people using drugs , in fact it {is/has} lead to more people using cannabis .
<Sync time="132.390"/>
uh there's a reason why over fifty percent of people in the united states , which is not exactly known for being progressive on a lot of issues ,
<Sync time="139.560"/>
supports this .
<Sync time="140.430"/>
because , people recognize that it's not
<Sync time="143.005"/>
working ,
<Sync time="143.640"/>
because people have been using the drugs , and the only thing is that , the drug is getting cheaper , and it's getting stronger and more people are using it ,
<Sync time="149.885"/>
and that's obviously - when you're spending billions of dollars on something - a
<Sync time="153.190"/>
failure . but , let's talk about those billions of dollars .
<Sync time="156.060"/>
because the enforcement of these laws , that aren't working ,
<Sync time="158.970"/>
is costing us billions of dollars each and every year ,
<Sync time="162.395"/>
and all of that money could be used on anything , if you- you could burn those billions of dollars , and it would be more useful than what's happening in the status quo .
<Sync time="170.030"/>
but in addition to the fact you're spending billions of dollars ,
<Sync time="173.210"/>
there's a compounding lost , in that you're losing billions of dollars in potential tax revenue ,
<Sync time="178.130"/>
because you can't tax these-
<Sync time="180.130"/>
you can't tax people in the marijuana industry who make income out of this ,
<Sync time="183.930"/>
you can't tax the corporations who do these kinds of businesses ,
<Sync time="187.080"/>
you can't tax all the employers and things like that .
<Sync time="189.840"/>
um so , all of that is additional lost revenue .
<Sync time="192.215"/>
but ,
<Sync time="193.165"/>
additionally , it's also bad because
<Sync time="195.645"/>
if you're worried about things like
<Sync time="197.100"/>
gateway drugs , or safe
<Sync time="198.550"/>
use , and things like that ,
<Sync time="199.940"/>
it's only better uh
<Sync time="201.720"/>
if you're going to legalize it , and worse if you keep the status quo .
<Sync time="204.745"/>
and the reason for that is because ,
<Sync time="206.715"/>
if you're worried about gateway drugs , if you legalize marijuana and you go into a marijuana store ,
<Sync time="211.645"/>
you're not going to find heroin there .
<Sync time="213.280"/>
but , if you go to enough marijuana dealers , they'll probably have shrooms , they'll probably have l_s_d or cocaine ,
<Sync time="218.970"/>
maybe even heroin .
<Sync time="220.590"/>
i think that , it's a whole lot more likely that you're going to have these problems .
<Sync time="223.700"/>
additionally , if you're worried about
<Sync time="225.140"/>
underage use , it's not like a drug dealer ,
<Sync time="227.780"/>
under the table , is going to care about if you're fifty dollars came from someone who's sixteen or twenty five ,
<Sync time="233.340"/>
but
<Sync time="233.740"/>
obviously , in an institutionalized established store ,
<Sync time="237.310"/>
that has to worry about losing its license to sell , and all of its profits ,
<Sync time="241.420"/>
they're not going to be as willing to give
<Sync time="243.580"/>
weed away to minors .
<Sync time="244.445"/>
so , if your problems are safe access and things like that ,
<Sync time="247.590"/>
uh
<Sync time="248.140"/>
then it's clearly just better .
<Sync time="249.470"/>
but additionally , you're also not going to have to worry about like the possibilities of there being harmful substances ,
<Sync time="254.590"/>
because you actually know what you're going to get .
<Sync time="256.600"/>
so for all those reasons ,
<Sync time="257.880"/>
and honestly many many more ,
<Sync time="259.450"/>
we should legalize marijuana .
<Sync time="261.645"/>
