we should not introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="2.570"/>
our argument is essentially going to come in two parts , the first part is that a flat tax
<Sync time="7.090"/>
is inherently a %hes
<Sync time="8.650"/>
a regressive tax
<Sync time="9.985"/>
based on the system of taxation
<Sync time="12.100"/>
and the system of capitalism that we live in ,
<Sync time="14.085"/>
and the second argument and the second prong is essentially
<Sync time="16.850"/>
why a regressive tax
<Sync time="18.180"/>
is always going to be bad .
<Sync time="19.945"/>
alright so let's talk about why flat tax
<Sync time="22.515"/>
is regressive .
<Sync time="23.640"/>
a flat tax means that everyone is paying a roughly equal percentage of their income
<Sync time="27.465"/>
to the governmemt .
<Sync time="28.595"/>
what this means is that when you have a lower income
<Sync time="31.510"/>
you spend you're giving up an equal percentage of your income
<Sync time="34.920"/>
no matter how much more money someone else's making .
<Sync time="37.115"/>
but when you have a lower income
<Sync time="38.830"/>
each dollar
<Sync time="39.735"/>
is %hes is much more valuable than any single dollar
<Sync time="43.220"/>
that someone who is more wealthy has and the
<Sync time="45.400"/>
reason for this is that
<Sync time="46.725"/>
when you're making say twenty thousand dollars a year ,
<Sync time="49.650"/>
you're living near the poverty line .
<Sync time="51.370"/>
you're living
<Sync time="52.035"/>
with very little room left to function
<Sync time="54.700"/>
before taxes are even taken into account .
<Sync time="56.980"/>
but if you're living off say
<Sync time="58.620"/>
two million dollars a year ,
<Sync time="60.390"/>
you're so dramatically above the poverty line ,
<Sync time="62.990"/>
that most of those millions of dollars
<Sync time="65.240"/>
are not necessary in order for you to live
<Sync time="68.160"/>
uh in a comfortable environment , to live a comfortable life in which all of your needs are being met .
<Sync time="73.070"/>
the problem is when you have this so called flat tax ,
<Sync time="75.860"/>
that person that's making twenty thousand dollars a year say that tax is twenty five percent
<Sync time="80.460"/>
that person making twenty thousand dollars a year
<Sync time="82.520"/>
now only has fifteen thousand dollars to live off of
<Sync time="85.400"/>
below the poverty line
<Sync time="86.800"/>
and again those five thousand dollars
<Sync time="89.370"/>
are
<Sync time="89.760"/>
much more important than the five hundred thousand dollars
<Sync time="93.680"/>
that that person who
<Sync time="94.810"/>
is making two million dollars is giving up .
<Sync time="96.755"/>
and while it may sound
<Sync time="98.115"/>
ridiculous to say that it's
<Sync time="99.790"/>
more uh onerous on the person
<Sync time="102.310"/>
that's giving up five thousand dollars to the government
<Sync time="104.585"/>
than it is to the person that's giving up five hundred thousand dollars to the government ,
<Sync time="108.430"/>
we would say that the difference in disposable income
<Sync time="111.230"/>
illustrates that a flat percentage is
<Sync time="113.585"/>
in is
<Sync time="114.530"/>
more uh
<Sync time="115.605"/>
regressive because of the impact that it has .
<Sync time="118.370"/>
because you have
<Sync time="118.920"/>
much less disposable income
<Sync time="120.880"/>
at your disposal
<Sync time="122.130"/>
in order to use to feed yourself and to take care of yourself
<Sync time="125.160"/>
and because of this we would say that
<Sync time="127.400"/>
based on the impact that that tax has any sort of a flat tax is going to have
<Sync time="132.120"/>
a regressive impact
<Sync time="133.830"/>
even if you're paying the same percentage .
<Sync time="135.960"/>
but that impact is what really matters in the day-to-day lives
<Sync time="139.140"/>
of people that are paying these taxes
<Sync time="141.140"/>
as opposed to what percentage of their income
<Sync time="143.440"/>
they're losing because that
<Sync time="144.980"/>
impact
<Sync time="145.720"/>
is what
<Sync time="146.400"/>
affects whether or not they can afford to feed their children , whether or not they can afford
<Sync time="150.525"/>
to live in their homes , these types of things that have real world
<Sync time="153.620"/>
devastating impact .
<Sync time="154.940"/>
so why is a regressive tax bad ?
<Sync time="156.940"/>
we think a regressive tax
<Sync time="158.310"/>
could only be just if people who are worse off
<Sync time="161.220"/>
use more government resources , but this is simply a myth .
<Sync time="163.875"/>
it sounds true in theory but it's not .
<Sync time="166.020"/>
while yes people that are more uh
<Sync time="168.710"/>
that are worse off get things like welfare ,
<Sync time="171.270"/>
government infrastructure , market protections and national defense
<Sync time="174.530"/>
are ultimately more important to those who are wealthy because they profit off of things like
<Sync time="178.360"/>
those markets and those structures in ways
<Sync time="180.570"/>
that those who are poor do not . for example , if you have a business
<Sync time="183.450"/>
in which you sell copious amounts of goods on the market ,
<Sync time="186.440"/>
those market protections are far much more valuable to you
<Sync time="189.185"/>
than any sort of welfare
<Sync time="190.790"/>
that anyone who is poor is getting .
<Sync time="192.625"/>
we think you create a system where you need to spend more on welfare to support those whose money you're taking away at a higher clip anyway
<Sync time="199.110"/>
and this means that new tax revenue ends up being expended
<Sync time="202.080"/>
on the people that you're taking the money from anyway .
<Sync time="204.990"/>
we think that %hes that
<Sync time="206.640"/>
impact based taxes are better
<Sync time="208.415"/>
and therefore using a progressive percentage rather than a flat tax
<Sync time="211.905"/>
is more preferential because it means people are paying based on what they can afford
<Sync time="216.180"/>
and based on what they use
<Sync time="217.790"/>
not just
<Sync time="218.500"/>
on some sort of percentage that someone sets arbitrarily .
<Sync time="221.690"/>
for these reasons we should not introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="224.610"/>
