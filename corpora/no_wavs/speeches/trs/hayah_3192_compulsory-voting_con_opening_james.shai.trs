the government's speech boils down to the fact that they want to change the incentives of political parties and have them appeal
<Sync time="6.715"/>
to new people , and they want to solve voter apathy . the problem is they don't really do either of those things .
<Sync time="12.070"/>
and the other problem , ladies and gentleman ,
<Sync time="13.860"/>
with this issue of like : " let's change the incentives of political parties "
<Sync time="17.205"/>
what a silly way to solve this problem .
<Sync time="19.540"/>
right ?
<Sync time="20.150"/>
they say to themselves : " how can we get rich white guys to be more appealing to young poor black guys ? "
<Sync time="25.130"/>
well here's a better question :
<Sync time="26.735"/>
why don't we , instead of getting the rich white guys to be more appealing , why don't we just get more young poor black guys
<Sync time="32.525"/>
involved in politics ?
<Sync time="34.080"/>
right ?
<Sync time="34.530"/>
that would be a much
<Sync time="35.315"/>
more , that would be a much better and more real change
<Sync time="38.685"/>
that can and should be meeting countries like the united states .
<Sync time="41.680"/>
so for example ,
<Sync time="42.700"/>
policy changes that would make it easier for poor people to run for elections . right ? by doing things like limiting the amounts of money you can spend on your campaign .
<Sync time="50.225"/>
that would be of real change in politics that would allow real people who actually care about these issues
<Sync time="56.330"/>
to run
<Sync time="57.045"/>
and make the changes , and have more people involved in politics and actually get interested in politics
<Sync time="61.595"/>
and get people excited about politics again ,
<Sync time="63.850"/>
as opposed to just saying like : " hey let's get this rich old white guy " like the same
<Sync time="67.610"/>
political figures
<Sync time="68.665"/>
to like turn to these new populations . which we don't think that they're going to do
<Sync time="71.990"/>
anyways ,
<Sync time="73.530"/>
for a number of reasons .
<Sync time="74.730"/>
um
<Sync time="75.230"/>
not least of which is the electoral college system in the united states
<Sync time="78.530"/>
which is going to lead to
<Sync time="79.550"/>
a
<Sync time="79.865"/>
backlash about this policy and people being very upset about this policy , but no actual change in
<Sync time="84.710"/>
in um
<Sync time="85.395"/>
like who politicians are turning to , because they know where their voter base is .
<Sync time="89.340"/>
they know where they tend to win , they know where the votes are .
<Sync time="92.195"/>

<Sync time="92.770"/>
then we heard this idea of like voter apathy . right ? we're going to solve it . you don't solve voter apathy
<Sync time="97.630"/>
by bei- by threatening somebody with a fine or jail time .
<Sync time="100.720"/>
right ? that's not how you solve voter apathy . you're not more likely to get involved in politics for threatened with a fine or jail time ,
<Sync time="106.580"/>
you're just more likely to go stick any ballot in the box . right ? you go grab the first one that you see .
<Sync time="111.230"/>
or ,
<Sync time="112.070"/>
even more likely or
<Sync time="113.475"/>
and even worse , is you're going to um
<Sync time="116.045"/>
and you're gonna see a lot more
<Sync time="117.540"/>
novelty voting . right ?
<Sync time="118.960"/>
people who write jed bartlet for president on their ballot ,
<Sync time="121.910"/>
are people who stuff fifteen ballots
<Sync time="123.670"/>
into their , into their envelope , or people who put in
<Sync time="126.690"/>
blank ballots ,
<Sync time="127.660"/>
or people who put in
<Sync time="128.650"/>
ballots for the party that they think has
<Sync time="130.825"/>
the funniest name or the funniest platform .
<Sync time="132.915"/>
so in countries that have a multi-party system , for example 
<Sync time="136.670"/>
uh israel ,
<Sync time="137.770"/>
you're going to get a lot of votes for for um novelty parties such as
<Sync time="141.505"/>
the green party ,
<Sync time="142.780"/>
whose entire platform is based on promoting uh um
<Sync time="146.265"/>
the legalization of marijuana .
<Sync time="148.480"/>
not that there's anything wrong with that being a party platform
<Sync time="151.000"/>
or being a policy platform or or being a policy that people believe in ,
<Sync time="154.540"/>
but when you get but when you force people to vote
<Sync time="156.950"/>
and you get
<Sync time="157.610"/>
huge swaths of the population who think that it's a big joke ,
<Sync time="160.860"/>
or %hes
<Sync time="161.590"/>
who are angry at the government for forcing them to go and vote ,
<Sync time="164.140"/>
you're gonna get a lot of votes like that which doesn't necessarily reflect the true will of the people
<Sync time="168.870"/>
either .
<Sync time="169.660"/>
so i think that you get
<Sync time="170.940"/>
disproportionate power for small
<Sync time="173.375"/>
uh
<Sync time="173.990"/>
um for small interest groups rather than a better representative
<Sync time="177.735"/>
government .
<Sync time="178.820"/>
more than that , ladies and gentlemen , we think that you violate the freedom of speech by compelling people to speak .
<Sync time="183.250"/>
we think that you have a right to vote but not a
<Sync time="185.400"/>
duty to vote and we think that that's %hes
<Sync time="188.010"/>
a big difference . right ? you can choose to vote you can choose not to vote .
<Sync time="191.210"/>
and the fact is , ladies and gentleman ,
<Sync time="193.280"/>
that the non vote should be enough of a vote for us .
<Sync time="196.320"/>
it gives us a lot of information . it gives the governing parties a lot of information .
<Sync time="200.130"/>
it means anybody who truly cares about changing
<Sync time="202.695"/>
uh the country that they live in ,
<Sync time="204.160"/>
who truly cares about politics will look to those people and say : " why aren't they voting ? "
<Sync time="207.895"/>
right ? when you had barack obama , for example ,
<Sync time="209.990"/>
who when he ran for president ,
<Sync time="211.440"/>
you did get a lot of people who in the past it and vote ,
<Sync time="213.850"/>
and he appealed to them . he cared about them and he looked at the people who weren't voting and said i want to appeal to them .
<Sync time="219.070"/>
we think that that's
<Sync time="220.045"/>
um a a good idea . we think that
<Sync time="221.670"/>
the information that you get from having a non vote
<Sync time="224.465"/>
from every election being told
<Sync time="225.965"/>
this is the number of people who just didn't care enough to go out to the to the polls .
<Sync time="229.860"/>
we think that that information is crucial and valuable to the government .
<Sync time="233.220"/>
its people telling them that they want to change the political system .
<Sync time="236.150"/>
for example , change it away from the electoral college , where people feel that the votes are being wasted .
<Sync time="240.110"/>
we think that it tells people that they're disillusioned with politics and that they need to change their ways . we think that there are better ways to solve the problem of apathy
<Sync time="246.330"/>
rather than this . thank you .
<Sync time="247.815"/>
