we should not
<Sync time="1.490"/>
further exploit wind power .
<Sync time="3.310"/>
so , what we think is very crucial in this debate is to
<Sync time="6.450"/>
point out at the start ,
<Sync time="7.830"/>
what the comparative in this round is .
<Sync time="9.950"/>
because we think that , in the status quo ,
<Sync time="11.950"/>
oftentimes different types of renewable energy resources
<Sync time="15.300"/>
in a free and open market ,
<Sync time="16.690"/>
compete for investments . the reason for this is that ,
<Sync time="19.105"/>
not a whole- because renewable energies are at this moment not very profitable ,
<Sync time="23.180"/>
and it's not something that investors are looking to eagerly invest in-
<Sync time="26.855"/>
in the status quo , so
<Sync time="28.105"/>
there are a limited amount of investors ,
<Sync time="30.100"/>
and there are {limin/limited} amount of
<Sync time="31.390"/>
fungible government funds , that can go into renewable energy resources .
<Sync time="35.740"/>
other funds are going into
<Sync time="37.290"/>
fossil fuels , and those types of energies ,
<Sync time="39.115"/>
and we don't think that this is really about ,
<Sync time="40.885"/>
whether or not we can get that type of revenue , because we think obviously it would be preferable
<Sync time="45.005"/>
if you could get that type of revenue into wind power , or any renewable power ,
<Sync time="48.395"/>
but this is about , if we're going to
<Sync time="50.280"/>
put our resources into a certain type
<Sync time="52.690"/>
of renewable energy ,
<Sync time="53.970"/>
should that type of renewable energy
<Sync time="56.240"/>
be wind power ? because we think that ,
<Sync time="58.330"/>
when you're saying which- uh which resources
<Sync time="61.010"/>
people should invest their money into ,
<Sync time="62.660"/>
when there's a necessary tradeoff , we need to talk about what is most efficient ,
<Sync time="65.980"/>
and most likely to come to market and the
<Sync time="67.830"/>
means that can
<Sync time="68.840"/>
actually effect
<Sync time="69.860"/>
real change , {ind/in} a wide variety of environments . we simply don't think
<Sync time="73.985"/>
that wind power
<Sync time="75.130"/>
is the type of technology
<Sync time="76.560"/>
that will allow that to be the case .
<Sync time="78.180"/>
so we think that there are two
<Sync time="79.940"/>
better alternatives , in regards to renewable energy resources ,
<Sync time="83.265"/>
that we should exploit 
<Sync time="84.555"/>
instead of
<Sync time="85.685"/>
wind power , given the fungabilities ,
<Sync time="87.790"/>
and the limits of spending in the status quo .
<Sync time="90.470"/>
so firstly , we think solar power is immensely more preferable
<Sync time="93.995"/>
to wind power . there are few developments in solar power
<Sync time="96.545"/>
that are crucial to recognize :
<Sync time="98.070"/>
first ,
<Sync time="98.730"/>
solar power is becoming increasingly more efficient , because solar cells themselves are becoming more efficient .
<Sync time="104.270"/>
the technology that allows
<Sync time="105.810"/>
for these batteries , these solar cell batteries , to store their electricity , the lithium ion batteries ,
<Sync time="110.765"/>
are becoming more and more sophisticated , which means that
<Sync time="113.480"/>
the cost curve
<Sync time="114.640"/>
for producing solar power is much lower than that
<Sync time="117.690"/>
of wind power . it's simply
<Sync time="119.275"/>
a more effective way of storing
<Sync time="121.480"/>
and holding energy ,
<Sync time="122.775"/>
and it's more applicable to smaller scale . so , whereas  you can have wind farms
<Sync time="127.280"/>
of d-
<Sync time="127.990"/>
uh  in different areas like oceans , and you know
<Sync time="130.520"/>
prairies in fields , and areas that get a lot of wind ,
<Sync time="132.960"/>
these end- end up feeding into a factory or a plant that disperses energy
<Sync time="136.870"/>
to uh
<Sync time="137.635"/>
like a small geographical area ,
<Sync time="139.600"/>
whereas solar power is something
<Sync time="141.330"/>
that most homes are capable of , on their own
<Sync time="143.970"/>
rooftops ,
<Sync time="144.820"/>
getting the type of solar ,
<Sync time="146.700"/>
the type of sun
<Sync time="147.790"/>
right now , with the current technology of solar power ,
<Sync time="150.600"/>
to fu-
<Sync time="151.420"/>
to fuel their house and their household needs ,
<Sync time="153.595"/>
for ninety percent of the time .
<Sync time="155.930"/>
given that this is the case , and given that
<Sync time="157.745"/>
it is a type of technology that isn't limited
<Sync time="159.965"/>
by a-
<Sync time="160.480"/>
by the capability to have a certain amount of wind at your availability ,
<Sync time="164.115"/>
or an immense amount of infrastructure developed 
<Sync time="166.830"/>
to allow these things to come to market in a way that is reasonable ,
<Sync time="170.020"/>
for the average consumer to take in ,
<Sync time="171.820"/>
we would say
<Sync time="172.680"/>
that solar power is immensely further advanced , especially given that there are companies like solar city ,
<Sync time="177.305"/>
run by elon musk , that already have immense amounts of resources at their disposal ,
<Sync time="181.245"/>
and are already putting products on the market . we think that , this is the avenue we should go down
<Sync time="185.420"/>
in regards to renewable resources . the other alternative that we think is preferable
<Sync time="189.190"/>
its nuclear energy :
<Sync time="190.430"/>
recognize in the status quo that nuclear energy is
<Sync time="193.210"/>
immensely underfunded , and immensely
<Sync time="195.330"/>
overfeared , because of certain instances , in which nuclear power plants have melted down ,
<Sync time="199.850"/>
but
<Sync time="200.275"/>
per the amount of nuclear energy , there are actually fewer nuclear accidents than there are
<Sync time="204.220"/>
from fossil fuels .
<Sync time="205.415"/>
and , the potential for nuclear energy
<Sync time="207.465"/>
is much more massive
<Sync time="208.995"/>
than any type of other energy , than wind power , than fossil fuels , than solar power
<Sync time="213.200"/>
can be .
<Sync time="214.000"/>
given that this is the case ,
<Sync time="215.505"/>
we think that , if you're going to invest in something that isn't
<Sync time="217.900"/>
already dominant on the market , like solar power ,
<Sync time="220.670"/>
if you're going to invest in new technologies , and developments of new technologies , we think
<Sync time="224.145"/>
that nuclear power has more potential than wind power .
<Sync time="226.505"/>
we think both alternatives are preferable to wind power ,
<Sync time="229.255"/>
and for these reasons we should not further exploit
<Sync time="232.000"/>
wind power .
<Sync time="233.320"/>
