we should ban
<Sync time="1.320"/>
trans fat usage in food .
<Sync time="3.125"/>
for the sake of this debate , we're willing to acknowledge that trans fat is delicious , but the core question of this debate is whether it's legitimate to make a choice for the citizens and narrow down the amount of their options .
<Sync time="15.460"/>
we believe that in the specific case
<Sync time="17.550"/>
of trans fat , the answer is yes .
<Sync time="20.150"/>
two arguments :
<Sync time="21.290"/>
one ,
<Sync time="21.835"/>
when is it possible to intervene in individual's choice ,
<Sync time="25.530"/>
and uh two ,
<Sync time="27.255"/>
harm to society , and not only to the user .
<Sync time="31.230"/>
so , first argument .
<Sync time="32.840"/>
in general , we support the rule according to which the state can't take decisions for the individual just to prevent them from doing
<Sync time="40.340"/>
like from harming themselves .
<Sync time="42.255"/>
but this rule has its exceptions .
<Sync time="44.365"/>
for instance , we ban many times substances that there are addictive , like heroin or cocaine ,
<Sync time="50.000"/>
because they are deadly ,
<Sync time="51.670"/>
like they are a deadly combination of both
<Sync time="54.570"/>
a serious physical harm to the person using them and they're physically addictive .
<Sync time="59.280"/>
in that particular situation ,
<Sync time="61.820"/>
the ability to treat
<Sync time="63.135"/>
the user as an individual with a free choice disappears .
<Sync time="67.105"/>
once a certain substance makes you
<Sync time="69.030"/>
physically dependent on it ,
<Sync time="70.755"/>
then there's not much point in discussing choice .
<Sync time="73.560"/>
another exception is , for instance , when we force people to wear seat belts ,
<Sync time="77.950"/>
even if they are driving alone .
<Sync time="80.005"/>
in this case , we can simply see
<Sync time="82.035"/>
that the level of intervention is very small .
<Sync time="84.620"/>
it's not aggressive or intrusive , just something that needs a bit of getting used to ,
<Sync time="89.310"/>
and that's it .
<Sync time="90.230"/>
but the benefits that arise from this action are huge .
<Sync time="93.330"/>
and so ,
<Sync time="94.215"/>
even though we're principally against intervening ,
<Sync time="97.030"/>
we're not going to be dogmatic , and we don't mind doing
<Sync time="100.160"/>
doing so
<Sync time="101.230"/>
in this particular case .
<Sync time="103.480"/>
when discussing trans fat , we think both these exceptions are relevant .
<Sync time="108.600"/>
firstly , trans fat is physically addictive and extremely dangerous to one's health .
<Sync time="113.790"/>
this is why , by the way , it's not enough to just try and educate the public about the risks of unhealthy eating .
<Sync time="120.910"/>
informing the public isn't good enough when it comes to
<Sync time="123.780"/>
addictive substances .
<Sync time="125.410"/>
secondly ,
<Sync time="126.270"/>
there are very good and healthy and cheap
<Sync time="128.900"/>
alternatives ,
<Sync time="129.860"/>
so
<Sync time="130.495"/>
all it would take is just to get used to eating less fatty
<Sync time="133.900"/>
fast food .
<Sync time="135.210"/>
the level of intervention here
<Sync time="136.740"/>
isn't serious , but the harm that's being prevented is huge .
<Sync time="140.120"/>
bottom line :
<Sync time="141.055"/>
the principle of individual liberty is great , but it must have its limits .
<Sync time="145.100"/>
we can't cling onto it while completely ignoring
<Sync time="148.360"/>
the benefits .
<Sync time="149.820"/>
second argument :
<Sync time="151.390"/>
harm to society . so ,
<Sync time="153.520"/>
even if i fail in convincing you that sometimes we must intervene just to prevent people from harming themselves ,
<Sync time="159.530"/>
clearly you'd agreed that we can intervene to protect
<Sync time="162.540"/>
to prevent harm
<Sync time="164.030"/>
from others .
<Sync time="165.130"/>
trans fats
<Sync time="166.260"/>
are not only harming whoever consumes them , but they're also
<Sync time="171.045"/>
a
<Sync time="171.690"/>
huge threat to the entire society .
<Sync time="174.390"/>
we've
<Sync time="174.840"/>
obesity on the rise and heart diseases as the main source of mortality in the western world .
<Sync time="180.630"/>
more and more people are becoming too ill to work and are required to undergo treatments that form a huge burden on the entire economy .
<Sync time="187.880"/>
society
<Sync time="188.860"/>
has a collective interest in safekeeping its citizens' health .
<Sync time="192.685"/>
so , even if it's a free choice ,
<Sync time="195.430"/>
when a man chooses to harm his
<Sync time="197.375"/>
his own health ,
<Sync time="198.820"/>
he harms his productivity as well ,
<Sync time="201.590"/>
and the entire society is built upon reciprocating productivity .
<Sync time="205.950"/>
therefore , he's harming his entire surroundings .
<Sync time="209.450"/>
now ,
<Sync time="209.965"/>
of course , that on an individual level , every trans fat
<Sync time="212.730"/>
eater is neglectable but on the aggregate level , we
<Sync time="215.905"/>
already reach a serious problem .
<Sync time="218.470"/>
this surely gives us all the legitimacy we need to intervene .
<Sync time="221.850"/>
so ,
<Sync time="222.600"/>
for all of these reasons , please propose .
<Sync time="226.300"/>
