we should not ban
<Sync time="1.890"/>
beauty pageants .
<Sync time="3.005"/>
and just to be clear , what we're defending on our side ,
<Sync time="5.715"/>
we would be fine with having a minimum age to enter beauty pageants , but we think that it would be wrong to categorically ban them
<Sync time="12.900"/>
completely in society .
<Sync time="14.910"/>

<Sync time="15.430"/>
our first argument is about personal freedom .
<Sync time="18.500"/>
we think that {et/at} its root , it would be very patronizing to ban
<Sync time="22.340"/>
beauty pageants , because it assumes that the people who participate in them
<Sync time="26.250"/>
do not understand the benefits and harms that beauty pageants may have
<Sync time="30.195"/>
in their own life .
<Sync time="32.160"/>
the other side tells you that beauty pageants subject women to the male gaze
<Sync time="36.130"/>
and encourage them to participate in patriarchal norms .
<Sync time="39.850"/>
but we think that it's quite possible
<Sync time="41.730"/>
that the women who participate in them are fully aware of the fact that they're being judged on their appearance ,
<Sync time="46.500"/>
how could they not be ,
<Sync time="47.820"/>
and choose to participate in this because they see some potential for personal gain .
<Sync time="52.710"/>
why should it be that if someone is extraordinarily beautiful , the government should intervene to prevent them from making money
<Sync time="58.840"/>
off of their appearance ?
<Sync time="60.620"/>
how is participating in a beauty pageant different than being a model
<Sync time="64.120"/>
or an actress in some cases ?
<Sync time="66.235"/>
the other side might say , " oh , this doesn't require talent like those things do " ,
<Sync time="70.470"/>
but we think that some models require more talent than others .
<Sync time="73.890"/>
should we ban people from being porn stars as well because it might be degrading ?
<Sync time="77.880"/>
whether or not we ought to , we don't , so we don't think we should single out
<Sync time="81.315"/>
people who participate in beauty pageants . we think that
<Sync time="84.320"/>
the women who participate ,
<Sync time="85.860"/>
especially if they're adults ,
<Sync time="87.365"/>
are able to make their own decisions .
<Sync time="89.340"/>
and if we're okay with letting people participate
<Sync time="91.755"/>
in other activities that could potentially demean them in the eyes of men ,
<Sync time="95.950"/>
we don't think that you should ban this one thing
<Sync time="97.950"/>
uniquely .
<Sync time="99.325"/>
but what's more ,
<Sync time="100.900"/>
implicit in many of the arguments of the other side
<Sync time="103.935"/>
is that it is anti-feminist to have beauty pageants .
<Sync time="107.760"/>
but we would advance a conception of feminism in which
<Sync time="110.680"/>
by making their own choices about how to live their lives ,
<Sync time="113.700"/>
even if women choose to participate in patriarchal power structures ,
<Sync time="117.920"/>
they're empowering themselves and that this should be the end goal of feminism .
<Sync time="121.655"/>
in other words , we should want men and women to be equally capable of making their own choices ,
<Sync time="126.510"/>
even if we don't like the choices that they make in some instances .
<Sync time="129.865"/>
you and i may think that people shouldn't participate in beauty pageants ,
<Sync time="133.680"/>
but we ought empower people to make that choice rather than take the choice away from them .
<Sync time="138.260"/>
it seems difficult to argue that by removing women's ability to make a choice , in this case to participate in beauty pageants ,
<Sync time="144.250"/>
that you somehow increase their personal freedom ,
<Sync time="147.300"/>
which we think should be the end goal of a feminist movement that claims to empower women .
<Sync time="152.305"/>
our second argument is that
<Sync time="154.700"/>
banning beauty pageants doesn't actually solve any problem in society , so we ought not to do it .
<Sync time="160.310"/>
we think that governments , in general , should only intervene to ban something or require something
<Sync time="165.295"/>
if it would make a meaningful difference in people's lives .
<Sync time="168.490"/>
if the net
<Sync time="169.070"/>
outcome of a policy is going to be the status quo ,
<Sync time="172.020"/>
it would be better for government to just do nothing .
<Sync time="175.250"/>
so what problems might beauty pageants cause ?
<Sync time="178.605"/>
they might cause people to view women as objects , they might cause people to
<Sync time="183.490"/>
respect women less . but we see that both of these are problems already ,
<Sync time="187.520"/>
even without beauty pageants .
<Sync time="189.630"/>
i don't think that the miss america pageant is the reason that people are sexist towards women or objectify them .
<Sync time="195.135"/>
there are many other reasons in our culture that this might be the case .
<Sync time="198.720"/>
i mentioned modeling earlier , and i think it's quite likely that as long as you
<Sync time="202.295"/>
continue the trend of marketing products by having beautiful women appear in their commercials
<Sync time="207.110"/>
that people will objectify women .
<Sync time="209.050"/>
so i just don't think that beauty pageants are the underlying root of this problem .
<Sync time="213.540"/>
at that point ,
<Sync time="214.430"/>
by banning beauty pageants , you don't actually do anything to make the world a better place .
<Sync time="219.280"/>
so what's the comparative here ?
<Sync time="220.870"/>
in a world in which you allow beauty pageants ,
<Sync time="223.590"/>
some people are able to benefit from participating in them .
<Sync time="227.020"/>
yes , that's a world in which sexism and patriarchy exist ,
<Sync time="230.615"/>
but the alternative world is one in which people can't choose to participate in beauty pageants ,
<Sync time="235.340"/>
but in which the world remains patriarchal
<Sync time="237.550"/>
and sexist .
<Sync time="238.550"/>
we would prefer the one with more freedom to the one to less
<Sync time="241.425"/>
when the patriarchy remains on either side .
<Sync time="244.360"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="245.649"/>
