holocaust denial
<Sync time="1.630"/>
should be a criminal offense .
<Sync time="3.470"/>
now obviously in this debate we're not talking about holding beliefs about holocaust denial
<Sync time="7.875"/>
but rather about propagating or promulgating those beliefs
<Sync time="11.000"/>
throughout society . whether this is
<Sync time="12.880"/>
publicly saying these things , publishing things that preach these types of ideas etcetera .
<Sync time="17.460"/>
we said we would ban and criminalize
<Sync time="19.625"/>
those types of things .
<Sync time="21.550"/>
so
<Sync time="22.080"/>
first , we think we need to talk about when we restrict speech , because we think we do it all the time the status quo
<Sync time="28.170"/>
for justifiable reasons . so
<Sync time="29.970"/>
firstly , we pe- restrict
<Sync time="31.420"/>
speech when it is harmful to people's identity .
<Sync time="34.350"/>
so this is distinct from speech that simply makes someone feel uncomfortable ,
<Sync time="38.130"/>
or makes someone feel sad ,
<Sync time="39.730"/>
but rather this is speech that directly targets individuals
<Sync time="42.600"/>
because of
<Sync time="43.770"/>
uh an irrevocable or unchangeable
<Sync time="46.410"/>
aspect of
<Sync time="47.145"/>
who they are . so things like hate crimes ,
<Sync time="49.840"/>
things like uh
<Sync time="50.950"/>
racist slurs against
<Sync time="52.665"/>
uh minority communities in the united states which are criminalize , things like taking action
<Sync time="57.120"/>
that specifically target
<Sync time="58.720"/>
minority
<Sync time="59.565"/>
and discriminated against communities ,
<Sync time="61.820"/>
so we restrict these things in the status quo because we don't think you have a right
<Sync time="65.460"/>
to spread those types
<Sync time="66.995"/>
of hated words . we think the freedom of speech exists
<Sync time="69.875"/>
in order to ensure that we can have
<Sync time="71.885"/>
an open marketplace of ideas that allows for
<Sync time="74.835"/>
increased discourse and increased self expression ,
<Sync time="77.730"/>
but when you spree- when you spread these types of ideas things , like holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="82.580"/>
you raised the experiences
<Sync time="84.400"/>
of an entire group of people , of the jewish population ,
<Sync time="87.275"/>
and an experience that shaped their identity
<Sync time="90.005"/>
as a culture
<Sync time="91.035"/>
that is something that was an attack on their existence and is something that
<Sync time="95.105"/>
is a turning point in human history
<Sync time="97.020"/>
and that needs to be recognized . we think that
<Sync time="99.285"/>
spreading these types of ideas
<Sync time="100.990"/>
undermines their identity and
<Sync time="103.090"/>
als- and also serves to undermine
<Sync time="105.065"/>
the marketplace of ideas  , the ability for people to express themselves
<Sync time="108.550"/>
which means that this is an instance
<Sync time="110.220"/>
in which you can criminalize and therefore
<Sync time="112.330"/>
restrict speech .
<Sync time="113.540"/>
the second reason that we can
<Sync time="115.560"/>
restrict speech is when it encourages bad social behavior .
<Sync time="118.740"/>
so recognized that
<Sync time="119.940"/>
holocaust denial doesn't exist in a vacuum . those that deny the holocaust
<Sync time="123.900"/>
are also often parts of things
<Sync time="126.000"/>
neo-nazi and fascist organizations
<Sync time="128.370"/>
and things that spread
<Sync time="129.420"/>
and preach anti-semitism .
<Sync time="131.420"/>
we think that
<Sync time="132.340"/>
all of these ideas are unacceptable within our society .
<Sync time="135.895"/>
to continue to demonized
<Sync time="137.900"/>
a group of people
<Sync time="138.930"/>
no matter what group of people , whether they be minority group or whether they be
<Sync time="142.335"/>
a jewish community we
<Sync time="143.600"/>
think is unacceptable
<Sync time="144.930"/>
within our society .
<Sync time="146.020"/>
all these people have
<Sync time="147.135"/>
the equal right to live a peaceful and prosperous life
<Sync time="150.180"/>
as anyone else
<Sync time="151.600"/>
and to
<Sync time="152.180"/>
de- and to have holocaust denial
<Sync time="154.985"/>
and to continue from there to preach things like harm against the jewish people
<Sync time="159.180"/>
and to
<Sync time="160.075"/>
because of holocaust denial said that they're liars about these types of things , that there's a vast jewish conspiracy which is what comes along with things like this ,
<Sync time="167.820"/>
we think that that is unacceptable and only breeds
<Sync time="170.315"/>
more violence against this group of people
<Sync time="172.990"/>
that has already suffered
<Sync time="174.030"/>
far too much violence over the course of their history .
<Sync time="177.140"/>
so
<Sync time="177.675"/>
the second reason that we think that we should
<Sync time="180.460"/>
uh that in this particular instance we should make holocaust denial a criminal offense
<Sync time="185.355"/>
is because to deny the holocaust
<Sync time="187.350"/>
into a race history creates a slippery slope
<Sync time="189.880"/>
in which we begin to forget the lessons of the holocaust .
<Sync time="192.670"/>
we think that the holocaust is a turning point in human history
<Sync time="195.700"/>
not because it was a genocide
<Sync time="197.240"/>
but because it was a nearly universally recognized and condemned genocide .
<Sync time="201.840"/>
it set an idea of what is unacceptable within a society
<Sync time="205.260"/>
and we think that to undermine the holocaust by denying its existence
<Sync time="209.180"/>
undermines the prohibitions that we have
<Sync time="211.340"/>
as societies
<Sync time="212.490"/>
on that idea and while
<Sync time="214.050"/>
genocide has occurred since the holocaust and will likely occur again ,
<Sync time="217.605"/>
we think that mass demonization
<Sync time="219.735"/>
of the holocaust
<Sync time="220.960"/>
gives us reason to interfere in
<Sync time="222.770"/>
and break sovereign states
<Sync time="224.990"/>
uh sovereignty
<Sync time="225.855"/>
and ensure that people are going to be protected and we think that that
<Sync time="229.410"/>
is of the utmost importance that we
<Sync time="231.515"/>
do not allow
<Sync time="232.775"/>
the holocaust or instances of genocide to occur
<Sync time="235.815"/>
in the future
<Sync time="236.900"/>
and as this undermines our ability to do that
<Sync time="239.180"/>
and also violates the entire reason we have freedom of speech by harming other individuals
<Sync time="243.960"/>
we think that holocaust denial
<Sync time="245.920"/>
should be a criminal offense .
<Sync time="247.690"/>
