<Sync time="2.580"/>
i'm proud to stand in prop-
<Sync time="4.030"/>
opposition to the motion ,
<Sync time="5.655"/>
that we should adopt libertarianism .
<Sync time="8.010"/>
i think generally speaking ,
<Sync time="9.565"/>
the way the gov approached this was to say : here is a high level reason
<Sync time="14.065"/>
why tyranny of the majority is bad .
<Sync time="16.425"/>
i don't think though , that that justifies abolition of a lot of important public resources ,
<Sync time="22.120"/>
that are important to minimizing suffering in the world .
<Sync time="25.590"/>
given this , i think that you can basically say :
<Sync time="28.530"/>
okay ,
<Sync time="29.250"/>
here's some really bad things , that happened in the status quo ,
<Sync time="33.060"/>
but generally speaking ,
<Sync time="34.400"/>
democracy should solve for that .
<Sync time="36.395"/>
generally speaking , the government
<Sync time="38.680"/>
does more good than harm ,
<Sync time="40.850"/>
and what i want to talk to you about
<Sync time="42.490"/>
is the ways in which the government
<Sync time="44.410"/>
reduces suffering ,
<Sync time="45.925"/>
by having the sort of infrastructure that gov would get rid of .
<Sync time="49.890"/>
first , we would say that redistributive taxation , and redistributive policies in general , are good .
<Sync time="56.210"/>
secondly , we would say that regulations are good ,
<Sync time="58.925"/>
and third , we would say that public resources , that are accessible to all ,
<Sync time="63.300"/>
are good .
<Sync time="64.320"/>
first on redistributive policies .
<Sync time="66.995"/>
we think , in the world ,
<Sync time="68.520"/>
there are haves and have-nots .
<Sync time="70.630"/>
this is true ,
<Sync time="71.540"/>
because
<Sync time="72.325"/>
it's probably , honestly , exacerbated on their side of the house ,
<Sync time="75.850"/>
but there are people who are poor ,
<Sync time="77.270"/>
there are people who are not poor ,
<Sync time="78.790"/>
and when you are born to someone who is poor ,
<Sync time="81.010"/>
you are also poor .
<Sync time="82.815"/>
this is the lottery of birth .
<Sync time="84.620"/>
it's not that people who are poor are intrinsically worth less ,
<Sync time="88.110"/>
but they suffer more , because of a lack of resources .
<Sync time="91.170"/>
we think then , that it is justified for the government to engage in policies , that take from the rich ,
<Sync time="96.190"/>
the haves , and give to the poor , the have-nots .
<Sync time="98.350"/>

<Sync time="99.160"/>
this is for , really , two reasons . the first is that
<Sync time="101.820"/>
equity decreases that suffering .
<Sync time="104.100"/>
suffering doesn't exist on a linear scale , that is , if you pump a bunch of money into a rich person's pocket ,
<Sync time="110.360"/>
they don't suddenly do that much better .
<Sync time="112.830"/>
that's because they'll generally spend it on things that
<Sync time="115.195"/>
aren't really important to quality of life , in the way that things like healthcare , or other basic things , are . they'll spend it on things , like a nice car a nice house .
<Sync time="124.030"/>
but secondly , we think that
<Sync time="125.830"/>
diminishing marginal returns ,
<Sync time="127.720"/>
an important concept of economics ,
<Sync time="129.520"/>
also apply to income .
<Sync time="131.430"/>
so , when i have
<Sync time="132.375"/>
lots of disposable money ,
<Sync time="134.010"/>
it's not worth as much to me ,
<Sync time="135.960"/>
because the diminishing marginal returns , on the individual dollars that i have ,
<Sync time="140.440"/>
are less and less , the more i have .
<Sync time="142.710"/>
we think
<Sync time="143.280"/>
equalizing the playing field
<Sync time="145.080"/>
means the most utility , because people get the most bang for their buck , they value it the most .
<Sync time="150.730"/>
our second independent point is that regulations are good ,
<Sync time="153.380"/>
because it partake-
<Sync time="154.550"/>
protects the weak from the powerful .
<Sync time="156.640"/>
on side government , you get rid of the regulations that prevent
<Sync time="159.360"/>
really bad things , like pollution , and price gouging ,
<Sync time="162.380"/>
things like that ,
<Sync time="163.265"/>
things where a third party is harmed ,
<Sync time="165.500"/>
but the person engaging in the bad action
<Sync time="167.695"/>
doesn't have an incentive to just not do it on their own act .
<Sync time="170.905"/>
this makes for an inherently worse world .
<Sync time="173.255"/>
you create things that increase net suffering , because the individual people engaging in these problematic
<Sync time="179.620"/>
actions
<Sync time="180.280"/>
don't have a force pushing against them , to say :
<Sync time="182.750"/>
don't do this thing , that makes the world significantly worse .
<Sync time="187.060"/>
our third independent point is that public resources are good ,
<Sync time="190.050"/>
that there are things that we should all have equal access to ,
<Sync time="193.220"/>
because they're facilitative to basic quality of life .
<Sync time="196.130"/>
i think a good example of this is
<Sync time="197.650"/>
roads , or sidewalks ,
<Sync time="199.200"/>
things that are important for us getting from point a to point b .
<Sync time="202.175"/>
but , if the government relinquishes control of these types of things ,
<Sync time="205.660"/>
it they privatize roads , and things like that , just like a lot of really really
<Sync time="209.700"/>
like
<Sync time="210.750"/>
very libertarian people would like to see ,
<Sync time="214.200"/>
then you have a lot of harms
<Sync time="216.110"/>
for the people that need that , to get from point a to point b .
<Sync time="219.120"/>
i think you wind up putting a lot of money into the pockets of people that already have money ,
<Sync time="223.460"/>
and siphoning it off of the people that need these public resources , in order to do things like
<Sync time="227.895"/>
get to their work , or get to a hospital , or all these other things .
<Sync time="231.390"/>
when you privatize out these services ,
<Sync time="233.550"/>
you make life very very difficult for people , that don't have the means to deal with the private sector .
<Sync time="239.155"/>
i think that's a significant problem , and i think that it leads to a lot of suffering .
<Sync time="243.380"/>
look ,
<Sync time="243.910"/>
i understand the sort of philosophical justifications that are given by government .
<Sync time="248.225"/>
i don't think though ,
<Sync time="249.445"/>
that they reconcile with the intense suffering that is created ,
<Sync time="252.660"/>
by the realization of these high level philosophical ideas . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="257.440"/>
