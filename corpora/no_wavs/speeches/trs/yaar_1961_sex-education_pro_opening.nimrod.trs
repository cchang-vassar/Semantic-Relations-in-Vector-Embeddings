sex education should be mandatory .
<Sync time="2.780"/>
by this we mean to give comprehensive lessons
<Sync time="5.890"/>
around the age of fifteen , you know ,
<Sync time="7.710"/>
beginning of high school ,
<Sync time="9.040"/>
that would be passed on
<Sync time="10.505"/>
by experts , and in which the children will learn the following things :
<Sync time="14.100"/>
what number one ,
<Sync time="15.085"/>
about the dangers of having unsafe sex ,
<Sync time="17.790"/>
s_t_d's , unwanted pregnancies , and so on .
<Sync time="20.300"/>
number two ,
<Sync time="21.290"/>
correct usage of contraceptions ,
<Sync time="23.725"/>
and number three how to be respectful towards your partner ,
<Sync time="27.840"/>
when and if having sex .
<Sync time="29.910"/>
we fully understand , that
<Sync time="32.210"/>
by doing so , the school is making a stand on a sensitive subject , that some parents might not be happy with .
<Sync time="38.850"/>
we nonetheless
<Sync time="39.650"/>
strongly believe that this is a
<Sync time="42.130"/>
stand that must be taken .
<Sync time="44.300"/>
two arguments ,
<Sync time="46.220"/>
number one , why do we think that sex ed
<Sync time="49.330"/>
is so crucial , and cannot be simply left for the parents ? and number two ,
<Sync time="54.030"/>
why are we willing to upset or displease conservative or religious parents ,
<Sync time="58.830"/>
in order to do so ?
<Sync time="60.060"/>
so ,
<Sync time="60.565"/>
to the first arguments .
<Sync time="63.090"/>
first of all , we think that
<Sync time="65.145"/>
it can be widely agreed upon ,
<Sync time="67.130"/>
that it is essential that children
<Sync time="69.250"/>
in these ages , in which they start exploring their sexuality ,
<Sync time="72.615"/>
will somehow learn about
<Sync time="74.415"/>
the three things that i've mentioned
<Sync time="75.990"/>
in the opening of my speech .
<Sync time="77.750"/>
now ,
<Sync time="78.205"/>
we admits , fully , that to many children ,
<Sync time="81.000"/>
perhaps most children ,
<Sync time="82.470"/>
sex education classes
<Sync time="84.915"/>

<Sync time="85.620"/>
aren't really necessary . they wouldn't really teach you a lot of new stuff , and they usually are just a funny experience , or an awkward experience ,
<Sync time="93.015"/>
and that is because many parents do sit down and talk
<Sync time="96.055"/>
with their children ,
<Sync time="97.080"/>
and explain them , in an orderly fashion , you know , the birds and the bees talk .
<Sync time="100.870"/>
or , they have a big brother or a bigger sister ,
<Sync time="104.110"/>
that they- that
<Sync time="104.870"/>
can
<Sync time="105.530"/>
use as- that they can be used as an example .
<Sync time="108.295"/>
but , there are also children ,
<Sync time="110.065"/>
that don't get to learn this
<Sync time="111.900"/>
in an orderly fashion ,
<Sync time="113.840"/>
whether because their parents don't really know how to breach this subject , and prefer to avoid it altogether ,
<Sync time="119.690"/>
or because they barely see their parents , that have to work
<Sync time="123.180"/>
like every day ,
<Sync time="124.330"/>
um and go- and get home back very late ,
<Sync time="127.720"/>
or for any other reason really .
<Sync time="129.355"/>
and , what these children
<Sync time="131.115"/>
will probably be exposed to are things like pornography .
<Sync time="134.950"/>
and we think that pornography
<Sync time="136.555"/>
is a horrible example to learn from ,
<Sync time="139.345"/>
both in terms of
<Sync time="140.640"/>
safety , and in terms of being respectful .
<Sync time="143.630"/>
sex ed classes are free .
<Sync time="145.890"/>
these particular children ,
<Sync time="147.210"/>
exactly the balancing factor that's so- so
<Sync time="150.360"/>
needed .
<Sync time="150.995"/>
we have to make sure
<Sync time="152.300"/>
these children have at least one positive
<Sync time="154.875"/>
image of how sexuality should
<Sync time="157.325"/>
look like .
<Sync time="158.375"/>

<Sync time="159.100"/>
so , over to the next argument , why are we willing to displease
<Sync time="162.940"/>
certain parents ? first of all ,
<Sync time="165.115"/>
because
<Sync time="166.085"/>
the kids-
<Sync time="166.880"/>
the- like the children
<Sync time="168.240"/>
of these parents , despite what
<Sync time="170.080"/>
they might be thinking ,
<Sync time="171.500"/>
are just as much children as other children , and then there's a huge probability
<Sync time="176.595"/>
that they will
<Sync time="177.615"/>
go out and explore their sexuality ,
<Sync time="180.360"/>
one way or another during these years .
<Sync time="182.595"/>
to think
<Sync time="183.465"/>
otherwise is to be incredibly naive ,
<Sync time="186.040"/>
even blinded , to human nature ,
<Sync time="188.205"/>
and we owe it to the children ,
<Sync time="190.200"/>
not to the parents .
<Sync time="191.700"/>
those children
<Sync time="192.930"/>
might feel embarrassed , by having their parents upset from this . they- it might put them in a tight spot ,
<Sync time="200.580"/>
but it would be a hundred times better
<Sync time="203.495"/>
than having them ,
<Sync time="205.000"/>
you know , have accidental like having them
<Sync time="207.930"/>
accidentally
<Sync time="208.930"/>
conceive and have to go through an abortion .
<Sync time="212.390"/>
additionally ,
<Sync time="213.400"/>
the fact that there is a certain group that opposes
<Sync time="217.800"/>
some content , that's being delivered in the classroom ,
<Sync time="221.140"/>
cannot be a good enough justification to avoid that this content .
<Sync time="225.490"/>
otherwise ,
<Sync time="226.330"/>
we would have been left with barely nothing .
<Sync time="228.805"/>
should we avoid
<Sync time="229.880"/>
teaching
<Sync time="230.555"/>
evolution , just because creationists oppose it ?
<Sync time="234.750"/>
in any-
<Sync time="235.890"/>
in- like in every history class ,
<Sync time="238.545"/>
we are
<Sync time="239.400"/>
uh teaching
<Sync time="240.650"/>
contents that are political , by definition , because
<Sync time="243.570"/>
the mere decision what
<Sync time="245.125"/>
to discuss , and what not to discuss , is political .
<Sync time="247.955"/>
and so ,
<Sync time="248.580"/>
you can never ever please all of the factions and groups
<Sync time="252.070"/>
in society .
<Sync time="253.170"/>
so , to sum it all up ,
<Sync time="254.830"/>
we showed you
<Sync time="255.745"/>
that sex ed is critical ,
<Sync time="258.085"/>
for
<Sync time="258.835"/>
these children , and that there is no good cause to
<Sync time="262.100"/>
avoid
<Sync time="263.090"/>
discussing it .
<Sync time="264.310"/>
support the motion .
<Sync time="266.100"/>
