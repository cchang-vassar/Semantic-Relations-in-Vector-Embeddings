we should lower the age of consent . 
<Sync time="3.640"/>
so by this we mean that in jurisdictions where it's not already the case
<Sync time="7.700"/>
we think that the age of consent
<Sync time="9.360"/>
should be sixteen years old for men and women
<Sync time="12.355"/>
and that there should be romeo and juliet laws . 
<Sync time="15.300"/>
so these are laws which basically say that if two people are under the age of consent ,
<Sync time="20.290"/>
then it's legal for them to have sex with one another even if it wouldn't be legal for them to have sex with an adult .
<Sync time="26.675"/>
and basically these laws are designed to prevent , you know ,
<Sync time="29.080"/>
teenagers who are in a relationship
<Sync time="31.170"/>
from accidentally ending up on the sex offender registry
<Sync time="34.120"/>
for something that was completely consensual and probably shouldn't be illegal .
<Sync time="37.510"/>
so with that in mind we're going to present two arguments for why we think these would be good policies .
<Sync time="42.815"/>
the first is basically that
<Sync time="44.545"/>
kids will be kids .
<Sync time="45.960"/>
we think that ultimately no one is being harmed
<Sync time="48.850"/>
if two people who are not
<Sync time="51.080"/>
adults yet choose to engage in consensual sexual activity .
<Sync time="54.475"/>
we think that in many jurisdictions right now the punishments are extremely harsh .
<Sync time="59.260"/>
in many american states people can end up on a sex offenders list , 
<Sync time="63.030"/>
where for the rest of their life it's going to be difficult for them to get employed .
<Sync time="66.270"/>
they won't be able to join the military ,
<Sync time="68.180"/>
they won't be able to access some sorts of education ,
<Sync time="70.720"/>
they're gonna have to tell their neighbors that they're a sex offender until the day that they die .
<Sync time="74.405"/>
and this is obviously a system that was designed to
<Sync time="76.800"/>
go after
<Sync time="77.780"/>
perverts and people who are doing really awful things
<Sync time="80.430"/>
not
<Sync time="80.890"/>
sixteen year olds who hooked up
<Sync time="83.145"/>
after prom one night . so we think that the law isn't actually serving the purpose it was intended to create .
<Sync time="89.120"/>
we think that it's really important
<Sync time="90.705"/>
that we don't let the letter of the law
<Sync time="92.990"/>
get in the way of protecting and helping people .
<Sync time="96.060"/>
so obviously we want to protect minors from being
<Sync time="98.860"/>
taken advantage of by adults ,
<Sync time="100.715"/>
but we also want to recognize that
<Sync time="102.945"/>
people who are sixteen are probably able to consent to being in a relationship and having sexual intercourse with one another
<Sync time="108.935"/>
and doing that
<Sync time="109.730"/>
in a responsible way , particularly if we offer things like sex education
<Sync time="113.725"/>
in schools .
<Sync time="115.200"/>
so we think that at that point
<Sync time="116.435"/>
the best way that the law can help these people
<Sync time="118.800"/>
is to
<Sync time="119.840"/>
make it so that there is these romeo and juliet laws so that people can
<Sync time="123.740"/>
engage in sex with their peers while still protecting them if they're taken advantage of by someone older .
<Sync time="128.415"/>
and also by recognizing that sixteen year olds are probably able to make
<Sync time="132.020"/>
meaningful consent .
<Sync time="133.420"/>
which leads lice- nicely into my second point , which is about legal consistency .
<Sync time="137.490"/>
so in many american states people are able to
<Sync time="140.605"/>
get married at age sixteen .
<Sync time="142.340"/>
you can join the military with your parents consent at age sixteen .
<Sync time="145.500"/>
you can drive a car at age sixteen .
<Sync time="147.820"/>
we think that all of these are probably bigger decisions
<Sync time="150.370"/>
than choosing to have sex . so at that point we think that the law
<Sync time="153.320"/>
should be consistent .
<Sync time="154.860"/>
basically , if people are being given
<Sync time="156.940"/>
a high amount
<Sync time="158.065"/>
of authority to make decisions about their own lives , we think that those decisions
<Sync time="161.870"/>
should be free for them to make across the board .
<Sync time="164.450"/>
i don't see why someone who is
<Sync time="165.820"/>
emotionally and physically mature enough to drive a car
<Sync time="168.630"/>
or serve in the nation's military
<Sync time="170.365"/>
shouldn't also be allowed to engage
<Sync time="172.210"/>
in a consensual sexual relationship .
<Sync time="174.500"/>
it just seems that if the government is saying that that person's judgment is good enough for one ,
<Sync time="178.500"/>
it should clearly be good enough for the other .
<Sync time="180.700"/>
we think that
<Sync time="181.300"/>
the possibility for a third party harms or great personal risk from people
<Sync time="185.380"/>
choosing to have consensual sex is much lower , honestly , than driving
<Sync time="188.910"/>
much less getting married or serving in the military . so we think that at that point
<Sync time="192.265"/>
that the government should be consistent
<Sync time="194.275"/>
and lower the age of consent to sixteen
<Sync time="196.530"/>
across the board .
<Sync time="197.980"/>
and the other team might say well ,
<Sync time="199.770"/>
it's only in america that people can do these things when they're so young .
<Sync time="203.220"/>
but we still think that it's clear that sixteen year olds
<Sync time="206.425"/>
in
<Sync time="207.075"/>
different countries around the world probably have similar levels of emotional maturity .
<Sync time="211.910"/>
what might be the case is that there's not enough sexual education in some parts of the world
<Sync time="216.350"/>
for young people to fully understand
<Sync time="218.105"/>
things like s_t_ds or the risk of pregnancy and how to use contraception .
<Sync time="222.120"/>
but we think that in that case it would be better to facilitate
<Sync time="224.910"/>
access to that information and access to contraception
<Sync time="228.040"/>
rather than just to ban
<Sync time="229.635"/>
any sort of sexual activity .
<Sync time="231.250"/>
because we don't think that's ever going to be effective . 
<Sync time="233.550"/>
there's no way to stop young people from having sex and the law should take that into account .
<Sync time="237.600"/>
and even if it might be preferable for some people's , you know , moral
<Sync time="240.640"/>
or religious beliefs that young people didn't have sex at the point where they will
<Sync time="244.220"/>
the law should be pragmatic
<Sync time="245.760"/>
and acknowledge that
<Sync time="246.815"/>
and try to protect young people from
<Sync time="248.830"/>
unforeseen
<Sync time="249.680"/>
legal consequences like ending up on a sex offender registry
<Sync time="252.945"/>
and to provide information and contraceptives and things like that so that they can be safe .
<Sync time="257.250"/>
so for these reasons we would lower the age of consent .
<Sync time="259.819"/>
