so we hear at the beginning of their speech quite a lot from side government on
<Sync time="4.830"/>
how much trans fat are a risk
<Sync time="8.220"/>
and unhealthy and leading to heart diseases and so on .
<Sync time="11.940"/>
now we're not going to argue , obviously , this is off-clash , of course , that trans fat
<Sync time="16.230"/>
isn't healthy ,
<Sync time="17.470"/>
but we should pay it
<Sync time="19.320"/>
like we should keep in mind that
<Sync time="21.615"/>
sugar
<Sync time="22.845"/>
is also
<Sync time="23.900"/>
horrible for health . so we might as well
<Sync time="26.370"/>
ban this is well , right ?
<Sync time="27.720"/>
and
<Sync time="28.500"/>
what about carbs and white flour ?
<Sync time="30.950"/>
it has also become quite apparent recently that
<Sync time="33.395"/>
dairy products are also terrible for one's health , so
<Sync time="36.865"/>
we need to cut them out as well .
<Sync time="38.790"/>
and what about what tobacco does to
<Sync time="41.180"/>
your lungs ,
<Sync time="42.580"/>
or what alcohol does to your liver ?
<Sync time="45.065"/>
and it doesn't even stop there . we say also that it's very
<Sync time="48.285"/>
risky and dangerous to one's health not to indulge in any sports activity . so ,
<Sync time="53.375"/>
how about we force everyone to exercise ?
<Sync time="56.540"/>
we think we've made our point quite clear .
<Sync time="58.880"/>
if we would want to force people to lu- to lead healthy lives ,
<Sync time="63.090"/>
then we will never see the end of it .
<Sync time="65.700"/>
the question is , therefore , not whether
<Sync time="67.995"/>
something is
<Sync time="69.395"/>
healthy or dangerous ,
<Sync time="71.955"/>
but whether it is legitimate
<Sync time="74.290"/>
that we make the decision
<Sync time="75.880"/>
for our citizens .
<Sync time="77.895"/>
and we say that
<Sync time="79.910"/>
to that effect , we almost
<Sync time="81.470"/>
hadn't heard anything
<Sync time="83.135"/>
coming from the previous speaker .
<Sync time="85.740"/>
so then we do hear about how hard it is for the consumer to know exactly when he consumes trans fat , because there's a lot of
<Sync time="93.475"/>
different types of
<Sync time="95.390"/>
uh of , you know , fats ,
<Sync time="97.620"/>
uh so here's a couple of ideas that can solve this problem .
<Sync time="100.790"/>
a : educate the public .
<Sync time="102.500"/>
go out with a with a public campaign that explains exactly how dangerous trans fat
<Sync time="107.695"/>
is
<Sync time="108.560"/>
and
<Sync time="108.980"/>
teaches exactly how to avoid it .
<Sync time="111.750"/>
here's a second idea :
<Sync time="113.440"/>
we are okay with passing a law
<Sync time="116.095"/>
that forces a special , like , mark for each
<Sync time="120.600"/>
uh product that contains trans fat .
<Sync time="123.620"/>
maybe we can even put
<Sync time="125.130"/>
warning labels , like we put on cigarette packs .
<Sync time="128.270"/>
this is not a good enough reason to
<Sync time="130.130"/>
ban all of these products altogether .
<Sync time="133.015"/>
and eventually , we hear
<Sync time="135.310"/>
on how hard it is to opt out , because all of the corporations want to use it because it's cheap , so here's a few answers . well
<Sync time="142.540"/>
first of all ,
<Sync time="143.580"/>
yeah , it's true ,
<Sync time="145.270"/>
but it's true that it's harder ,
<Sync time="147.650"/>
but it's far from impossible .
<Sync time="149.970"/>
spoken from a vegan , i know that
<Sync time="152.625"/>
that i like i know a thing o-
<Sync time="154.135"/>
or two about how hard it is to avoid ingredients that are very dominant in
<Sync time="158.190"/>
many foods that people buy .
<Sync time="160.140"/>
but
<Sync time="160.780"/>
you could always build your diet more like
<Sync time="164.370"/>
to ba- to be based more on greens , like fruits or vegetables and and
<Sync time="168.635"/>
uh cereals and legumes , things like rice and barley and lentils and and
<Sync time="173.925"/>
beans and chickpeas and so on .
<Sync time="176.410"/>
these are not things that are expensive in any way , and everyone can afford them .
<Sync time="180.500"/>
b :
<Sync time="181.100"/>
we think that once we educate the public to as to the dangerous of trans fats ,
<Sync time="186.350"/>
then there will be a market for alternative products that don't have trans fats . of course , such a market already exists but the more that we educate the public ,
<Sync time="195.530"/>
the larger this market will grow . and like any market ,
<Sync time="198.455"/>
if it's important enough for consumers ,
<Sync time="200.880"/>
then they will buy more of it , and this option will become more available and and and cheaper for everyone
<Sync time="206.515"/>
and if not ,
<Sync time="207.745"/>
then not . this just means that people don't care enough .
<Sync time="210.920"/>
so ,
<Sync time="211.550"/>
eventually we say
<Sync time="212.930"/>
that we have to treat our citizens like grownups , like
<Sync time="216.620"/>
big boys that are responsible for the consequences of their own decisions .
<Sync time="220.770"/>
we don't have a right to force anyone
<Sync time="223.270"/>
to lead a healthy life or to have a health-
<Sync time="226.520"/>
healthy lifestyle .
<Sync time="227.850"/>
people are allowed to hurt themselves if they so choose .
<Sync time="231.180"/>
we believe that , in general , the country ,
<Sync time="233.705"/>
the state and the law can can only intervene
<Sync time="237.325"/>
in actions
<Sync time="238.325"/>
that harm
<Sync time="239.410"/>
a certain third party
<Sync time="241.170"/>
according to the harm principle . so
<Sync time="243.505"/>
all in all , very proud to oppose .
<Sync time="246.463"/>
