-ot further exploit hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="2.870"/>
so we want to start off this debate by explaining to main
<Sync time="6.400"/>
principles that we're gonna guide our argumentation around .
<Sync time="9.160"/>
the first is that it's important to recognize in this debate
<Sync time="12.250"/>
that there's a fungible amount
<Sync time="13.960"/>
of resources available for clean energy
<Sync time="16.725"/>
development and clean energy technology .
<Sync time="19.250"/>
there are only so many investors willing to enter into the green tech market ,
<Sync time="22.900"/>
there's only so many resources available , there's only so many people
<Sync time="26.170"/>
that are qualified
<Sync time="27.530"/>
to work in the engineering and in the development of these types of technology . so
<Sync time="32.115"/>
when we're talking about whether or not we're going to further exploit hydroelectric dams ,
<Sync time="36.240"/>
we don't think the main comparatives is between this and fossil fuels ,
<Sync time="39.330"/>
but rather between this and other types of green tech
<Sync time="42.110"/>
such as solar and wind energy .
<Sync time="44.410"/>
and the second thing that's important to recognize is that
<Sync time="47.060"/>
when we're talking about clean energy technology ,
<Sync time="49.810"/>
what's important is not just the fact that we make the transition to green energy tech ,
<Sync time="54.285"/>
but also that we quickly scale up .
<Sync time="57.095"/>
uh because
<Sync time="58.130"/>
it's not just a matter of converting , but doing so in a very fast
<Sync time="61.800"/>
manner , ensuring that
<Sync time="63.175"/>
the worst climate change impacts don't come to pass , and the only way to do that
<Sync time="67.400"/>
is by scaling up quickly so that
<Sync time="69.455"/>
the vast majority of people
<Sync time="71.140"/>
are on the green energy uh
<Sync time="72.840"/>
grid , are using green tech
<Sync time="74.750"/>
for their energy consumption and their energy needs .
<Sync time="77.500"/>
and what's important is that in order to have this type of scale up
<Sync time="81.040"/>
you can only choose to develop and really invest
<Sync time="83.905"/>
in one , maybe two types of technology , because you need to
<Sync time="87.040"/>
put so many of your resources
<Sync time="89.325"/>
into the investigation , into the engineering , into the further development
<Sync time="93.190"/>
to make these types of technologies
<Sync time="94.750"/>
more efficient . so
<Sync time="96.340"/>
what we're going to argue is that hydroelectric dams
<Sync time="99.110"/>
are a less useful form of green energy
<Sync time="102.000"/>
then specifically solar
<Sync time="103.920"/>
or wind . so there are a few reasons
<Sync time="106.115"/>
why you think that's the case : so firstly ,
<Sync time="108.655"/>
it's important to recognize that hydroelectric dams
<Sync time="111.380"/>
are nontransferable , and what this means is that
<Sync time="114.440"/>
while they're useful in some areas where they're possible , in which there's large rivers or other sources
<Sync time="119.510"/>
of immense amounts of running water ,
<Sync time="121.510"/>
in areas where this isn't the case , areas that are very dry or
<Sync time="124.470"/>
mountainous or don't have these rivers nearby ,
<Sync time="127.130"/>
um
<Sync time="127.645"/>
this type of technology is not very useful in these areas . and while you can use this technology
<Sync time="132.340"/>
for a fairly large grid
<Sync time="134.310"/>
to power a fairly large grid ,
<Sync time="136.220"/>
uh it's not going to be enough to sustain
<Sync time="138.840"/>
um many cities on the same grid from the same source .
<Sync time="142.090"/>
and so we think that
<Sync time="143.830"/>
compared to things like solar energy in which you can put a solar panel on basically almost any house in america at this point
<Sync time="150.240"/>
and you'll be able to get
<Sync time="151.590"/>
almost enough energy to %hes
<Sync time="153.450"/>
basically autonomously
<Sync time="155.000"/>
fuel that house , we think that this is just a much less efficient
<Sync time="158.075"/>
tool .
<Sync time="158.930"/>
secondly
<Sync time="159.640"/>
hydroelectric dams come with habitat destruction that other types of energy such a solar energy
<Sync time="164.900"/>
don't . when you develop a hydroelectric dam you really interfere with eco systems
<Sync time="169.035"/>
that are involved and where the dam is being developed . there's a lot of development that takes place
<Sync time="173.255"/>
not just for the dam but also in the area surrounding the dam because you need to build the infrastructure that will be able to transport the power ,
<Sync time="180.000"/>
you need to be able to put uh
<Sync time="181.375"/>
things in place so that people can work in the area ,
<Sync time="183.770"/>
all of these things harm the ecosystem in these areas
<Sync time="186.455"/>
whereas other types of green tech
<Sync time="188.200"/>
are less intrusive . we think that's just
<Sync time="190.120"/>
better for the environment ,
<Sync time="191.470"/>
better uh better goes with the philosophy of green tech .
<Sync time="194.025"/>
and finally we would say that
<Sync time="195.720"/>
other technologies are further ahead .
<Sync time="197.750"/>
there's been massive recent investment
<Sync time="199.920"/>
in solar cells . there's already an immense amount of infrastructure
<Sync time="203.175"/>
and development
<Sync time="204.280"/>
existing in solar cells . so we think that if we were to transition to solar energy
<Sync time="208.520"/>
rather than hydroelectric dams as our primary form of green technology ,
<Sync time="212.315"/>
that we would have a much better chance of scaling up quickly
<Sync time="215.470"/>
and we think there'd be more political will for this scale up . and what's important to remember is what we explained in the beginning :
<Sync time="221.000"/>
there are a fungible amount of resources 
<Sync time="223.030"/>
and scale up requires using almost all the resources , if we're going to do it fast enough .
<Sync time="227.725"/>
for these reasons we should not further exploit
<Sync time="230.610"/>
hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="232.595"/>
