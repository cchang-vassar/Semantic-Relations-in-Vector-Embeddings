we should disband nato .
<Sync time="2.900"/>
along the sixty or so years of its existence ,
<Sync time="5.620"/>
nato has turned from being the neighborhood watch to being the neighborhood bully .
<Sync time="10.010"/>
its actual interventions have turned out to be failures one by one ,
<Sync time="14.190"/>
and its very existence , an ever looming presence , pose a serious threat to the stability and safety
<Sync time="20.140"/>
of the global community .
<Sync time="21.510"/>

<Sync time="22.030"/>
first argument .
<Sync time="23.670"/>
how nato threatens russia and why it's a bad idea .
<Sync time="27.150"/>

<Sync time="27.890"/>
nato was originally created with the sole purpose of intimidating the soviet union from trying to expand westward ,
<Sync time="34.830"/>
and of course they created in return the warsaw alliance ,
<Sync time="39.165"/>
and so throughout the cold war we had this mutual deterrence on both sides
<Sync time="43.660"/>
that was quite effective in preventing escalations .
<Sync time="46.605"/>
but with the collapse of the u_s_s_r , the warsaw allia-
<Sync time="50.650"/>
alliance was disband and so it was seen reasonable to assume that nato
<Sync time="55.625"/>
should also follow .
<Sync time="57.450"/>
but in reality what happened is not only did nato not disband itself , but rather it expanded eastward ,
<Sync time="65.090"/>
allowing for the united states to place
<Sync time="68.210"/>
soldiers and missiles
<Sync time="70.220"/>
right across the border from russia .
<Sync time="73.170"/>
this
<Sync time="73.660"/>
understandably is being seen as a provocation by russia .
<Sync time="77.620"/>
why is that so bad ?
<Sync time="79.260"/>
because
<Sync time="79.720"/>
vladimir putin's russia doesn't respond well to such threats .
<Sync time="83.790"/>
there is little doubt today that russia isn't happy with a unipolar global system in which the u_s_a
<Sync time="89.500"/>
has all the control , and it wants to reassert its position
<Sync time="93.050"/>
as an international power .
<Sync time="95.270"/>

<Sync time="96.280"/>
perhaps that much is true
<Sync time="97.890"/>
with nat- with nato
<Sync time="99.300"/>
or without it ,
<Sync time="100.170"/>
but instead of intimidating the russians and have them quietly fold back ,
<Sync time="105.720"/>
nato has served as a thorn in the side of russian pride ,
<Sync time="110.245"/>
and it became a key catalyst or an excuse for russia
<Sync time="114.475"/>
to take all the more actions in the region .
<Sync time="117.220"/>
among its actions we can see the war against georgia ,
<Sync time="121.145"/>
the intervention in the ukrainian crisis and annexation of crimea , and the intervention in the syrian civil war .
<Sync time="127.840"/>

<Sync time="128.740"/>
nato feeds into the nationalist sentiment that fuels these aggressions ,
<Sync time="133.090"/>
and had it not been for the western provocation of nato expanding eastward ,
<Sync time="137.740"/>
it is unlikely that russia would have dared to take all these aggressive steps .
<Sync time="142.565"/>
but nato provides putin
<Sync time="144.735"/>
with the local support he needs
<Sync time="146.790"/>
inside russia ,
<Sync time="148.020"/>
and is a winning card with the international community as well .
<Sync time="151.560"/>
this is why
<Sync time="152.450"/>
instead of being a protective stabilizing tool ,
<Sync time="156.475"/>
nato has become a destabilizing force
<Sync time="159.910"/>
that brings more harm than good .
<Sync time="162.840"/>
second argument , why the
<Sync time="165.575"/>
interventionist approach has failed us .
<Sync time="168.780"/>
so ,
<Sync time="169.285"/>
nato isn't only seen as a body that reacts to attacks on its member states , like it originally was ,
<Sync time="176.370"/>
but also serves as a form of interventionist force ,
<Sync time="179.820"/>
as we can see from its involvement in the invasion of iraq
<Sync time="183.920"/>
and bombardment of libya .
<Sync time="186.870"/>
it seems that whenever the west tries to intervene militarily ,
<Sync time="190.940"/>
it only creates further chaos
<Sync time="193.100"/>
that leads to an even worse situation
<Sync time="195.720"/>
than before .
<Sync time="196.840"/>
this is true to both the examples
<Sync time="198.935"/>
that i've mentioned earlier , and of course
<Sync time="201.655"/>
any other thing that
<Sync time="203.875"/>
pops to mind .
<Sync time="205.505"/>
in addition ,
<Sync time="206.700"/>
we simply don't see why american or french or norwegian soldiers
<Sync time="212.260"/>
should be sen-
<Sync time="214.040"/>
should be {sended/sent} off
<Sync time="215.475"/>
and fighting and dying
<Sync time="217.580"/>
for some remote county in georgia .
<Sync time="221.200"/>
we believe that it's time to learn from the mistakes of our past
<Sync time="225.590"/>
and stop trying to see
<Sync time="227.475"/>
america and the west
<Sync time="229.295"/>
as the knights in bright shining armor that comes to save the day .
<Sync time="233.520"/>
for all of these reasons , we believe that nato should be disband .
<Sync time="239.280"/>
