we should ban boxing .
<Sync time="2.510"/>
so ,
<Sync time="3.535"/>
what we mean by this is that we think that
<Sync time="6.130"/>
uh countries
<Sync time="7.260"/>
which have strong regulatory agencies for sport
<Sync time="10.570"/>
ought to ban boxing . nothing tricky about what boxing is ,
<Sync time="14.055"/>
uh you know it's what mike tyson and all these people have done .
<Sync time="16.980"/>
so ,
<Sync time="18.170"/>
three main arguments for you :
<Sync time="19.730"/>
the first is about why we think the government needs to intervene .
<Sync time="23.020"/>
we think that the state should
<Sync time="24.620"/>
ban a certain behavior
<Sync time="26.320"/>
when there is a lack of information available
<Sync time="29.360"/>
for one group participating in that behavior .
<Sync time="32.320"/>
so ,
<Sync time="32.940"/>
in this instance we think that boxers lack information about boxing
<Sync time="37.170"/>
that would allow them to make intelligent decisions .
<Sync time="39.740"/>
realize that the companies that promote boxing make a great deal of money off of people being willing to participate in this activity .
<Sync time="46.720"/>
what that means that you have lots of businessmen who are interested in convincing young people that it's perfectly safe to box ,
<Sync time="52.445"/>
that there's absolutely no risk to their long term health
<Sync time="55.095"/>
and that they'll make lots of money and get famous by choosing to do this .
<Sync time="58.450"/>
none of which is really true .
<Sync time="59.765"/>
there are tremendous risks from concussions , as we've seen
<Sync time="62.930"/>
with not only boxers but also other athletes , that have a long term
<Sync time="66.735"/>
health implications ,
<Sync time="68.930"/>
and in addition most people never go on to become successful boxers .
<Sync time="72.570"/>
we think that at the end of the day , the health risks greatly outweigh
<Sync time="75.685"/>
the vast wealth that someone like mike tyson
<Sync time="78.210"/>
might be able to accrue because of boxing .
<Sync time="80.375"/>
so we think the state should intervene to protect
<Sync time="82.515"/>
uh the boxers who lack access to good information about boxing .
<Sync time="88.050"/>
uh the second argument that we're going to advance in this debate is about why we think that boxing promotes violence .
<Sync time="94.770"/>
so , it seems pretty intuitive that
<Sync time="97.370"/>
a violent sport would encourage young people to view violence more positively than they would otherwise .
<Sync time="102.950"/>
realize that when young people grow up
<Sync time="104.990"/>
lionizing
<Sync time="106.000"/>
boxers , they're lionizing people who hit each other to solve their problems in effect .
<Sync time="110.865"/>
we think that at the point where we wouldn't accept
<Sync time="113.430"/>
school children %hes
<Sync time="115.370"/>
hitting each other or behaving
<Sync time="117.135"/>
in this fashion we shouldn't encourage it on the public stage
<Sync time="120.280"/>
either .
<Sync time="122.560"/>
lionizing an activity normalizes the behavior in society . it's not just that ,
<Sync time="127.365"/>
you know , impressionable children are going to fight more if they look up to mike tyson ,
<Sync time="132.250"/>
it's also that
<Sync time="133.470"/>
a culture which features boxing as a sport that's widely admired is more likely to admire violence writ large .
<Sync time="140.480"/>
we think that for instance the lionization of soldiers ,
<Sync time="143.515"/>
uh the lionization of police 
<Sync time="145.310"/>
and of violence in general is much more likely in a society that celebrates violent sport .
<Sync time="150.370"/>
we would prefer a world in which
<Sync time="151.970"/>
violence was seen as
<Sync time="153.855"/>
an unfortunate necessity when it does have to occur ,
<Sync time="157.890"/>
rather than something which is to be celebrated
<Sync time="160.570"/>
and glorified , and we think that boxing is incompatible with that view of the world .
<Sync time="164.640"/>
but certainly ,
<Sync time="165.435"/>
a world like that would have less violence , fewer people suffering from violence than the world that we live in
<Sync time="170.440"/>
today .
<Sync time="172.720"/>
the last argument that we're going to advance for you in this debate
<Sync time="175.475"/>
is that we think boxing is harmful for sporting culture .
<Sync time="178.985"/>

<Sync time="179.990"/>
recognize that
<Sync time="180.980"/>
boxing , which promotes these
<Sync time="182.585"/>
very high stakes fights between two people , i think that
<Sync time="185.850"/>
the fight between floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao was one of the most expensive paper view events of all time .
<Sync time="192.010"/>
uh boxing encourages sporting culture to focus on
<Sync time="195.180"/>
one major event rather than on
<Sync time="197.720"/>
achievement
<Sync time="198.530"/>
over time . we think that people are
<Sync time="200.805"/>
less likely to look at careers of excellence in other sport as something to celebrate
<Sync time="205.120"/>
as a result of boxing's prominence , because they're more likely to focus on one match ,
<Sync time="209.190"/>
or in this case one fight .
<Sync time="211.740"/>
but on top of that we think that
<Sync time="213.105"/>
because boxing is such a friendly sport to gambling and betting ,
<Sync time="217.035"/>
that it introduces
<Sync time="218.300"/>
uh more gambling and that because
<Sync time="221.040"/>
boxers are notorious for
<Sync time="222.510"/>
throwing fights in order to win money ,
<Sync time="225.210"/>
that this introduces more corruption into the sporting world
<Sync time="228.330"/>
in general .
<Sync time="229.390"/>
we would prefer that people focus on team sports , which promote good values as opposed to boxing ,
<Sync time="234.405"/>
and in addition we would prefer that they focus on sports
<Sync time="237.160"/>
with less gambling and which are less prone to corruption .
<Sync time="240.590"/>
so at the end of the day we should ban boxing
<Sync time="242.615"/>
because of this
<Sync time="243.690"/>
lack of information for boxers , because it promotes violence
<Sync time="246.760"/>
and because it harm sporting culture .
<Sync time="248.720"/>
thank you .
