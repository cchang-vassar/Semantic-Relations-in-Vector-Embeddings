three areas of clash as to why racial profiling
<Sync time="4.010"/>
ought not be allowed in airports .
<Sync time="6.350"/>
first , it is no longer relevant .
<Sync time="8.760"/>
there was a time when due to regional originality
<Sync time="11.410"/>
of certain groups of people
<Sync time="13.010"/>
racial profile was incredibly effective .
<Sync time="15.240"/>
because in the end , the majority of isis
<Sync time="17.720"/>
were iranians .
<Sync time="18.945"/>
but this has passed as soon as racial profiling
<Sync time="21.960"/>
became a known tactic .
<Sync time="23.715"/>
this is because terrorist organizations aren't stupid .
<Sync time="26.730"/>
they know that a brown man or a religiously dressed women
<Sync time="29.400"/>
are more likely to be stopped ,
<Sync time="31.080"/>
so instead they recruit white kids to do their dirty work .
<Sync time="34.620"/>
what this means is that instead of actually finding terrorists or likely criminals ,
<Sync time="39.300"/>
all that
<Sync time="40.335"/>
racial profiling accomplishes
<Sync time="42.675"/>
is
<Sync time="43.175"/>
creating a distraction from the real culprit
<Sync time="46.100"/>
and making it less likely that you're actually going to find them .
<Sync time="49.210"/>
because while you're bu-
<Sync time="50.155"/>
busy
<Sync time="50.810"/>
patting down the guy with the accent ,
<Sync time="53.210"/>
the person who actually has the dangerous item
<Sync time="55.905"/>
is much more likely to slip by unnoticed .
<Sync time="59.630"/>
it al-
<Sync time="60.150"/>
it's also no longer relevant
<Sync time="61.740"/>
because airport security has gotten so tight 
<Sync time="64.110"/>
that it's incredibly unlikely that anything will at smuggled in in the first place .
<Sync time="68.320"/>
at the point that you get stopped for aerosol cans that are actually just your deodorant ,
<Sync time="72.640"/>
and metal detectors exist
<Sync time="74.730"/>

<Sync time="75.490"/>
that
<Sync time="76.460"/>
sl- scan your whole body seamlessly ,
<Sync time="78.910"/>
we're not sure how exactly someone is going to get by with a weapon
<Sync time="82.615"/>
in the first place .
<Sync time="84.550"/>
our second area of clash has to do with why it's rights vi-
<Sync time="87.290"/>
violative .
<Sync time="88.195"/>
in the united states
<Sync time="89.560"/>
you are innocent until proven guilty
<Sync time="91.540"/>
by our constitutional rights .
<Sync time="93.540"/>
when you use racial profiling
<Sync time="95.430"/>
you pre-assume someone's guilt
<Sync time="97.340"/>
based on their race .
<Sync time="98.570"/>
therefore ,
<Sync time="99.385"/>
not allowing them innocence until there's proof .
<Sync time="102.100"/>
this is rights violative since now that person is treated like a criminal ,
<Sync time="105.940"/>
and stripped of their rights to their autonomy
<Sync time="107.920"/>
or to their property
<Sync time="109.200"/>
regardless of whether they actually committed the crime or not .
<Sync time="113.010"/>
in fact , they most likely didn't in the majority of these kinds of situations .
<Sync time="118.020"/>
at the point that we still exist in the united states ,
<Sync time="121.070"/>
we don't think that the government just gets to
<Sync time="122.930"/>
suspend these rights
<Sync time="124.360"/>
for efficiency's sakes .
<Sync time="125.990"/>
if that was the case then you have a special clause in the constitution
<Sync time="129.225"/>
that said you can become authoritarian when you feel like it .
<Sync time="133.135"/>
but we have these kinds of laws in place
<Sync time="135.290"/>
specifically to protect from authoritarian regimes .
<Sync time="138.180"/>
because sure ,
<Sync time="138.995"/>
right now we're afraid of muslims and isis .
<Sync time="141.490"/>
but these kinds of things can become
<Sync time="143.025"/>
more and more expensive
<Sync time="144.730"/>
if the justification can be
<Sync time="146.370"/>
security . in the end 
<Sync time="148.370"/>
anyone can become a security threat ,
<Sync time="150.345"/>
and the things that you can do in order to
<Sync time="152.830"/>
protect the security of a certain nation
<Sync time="155.260"/>
can also become infinite .
<Sync time="157.195"/>
we think this kind of slippery slope
<Sync time="159.040"/>
is incredibly real and we see this in other countries .
<Sync time="162.030"/>
that say they host democratic elections
<Sync time="164.150"/>
but then slowly take away
<Sync time="165.625"/>
rights to internet , as we see currently in russia ,
<Sync time="168.165"/>
because
<Sync time="168.815"/>
of security issues and being afraid of
<Sync time="171.360"/>
hackers and viruses .
<Sync time="173.320"/>
meanwhile what they're actually doing
<Sync time="175.470"/>
is
<Sync time="176.360"/>
suspending protesters
<Sync time="178.540"/>
and anyone who doesn't agree with the current government .
<Sync time="181.900"/>
our third area of clash has to do with why this is uniquely traumatizing
<Sync time="185.305"/>
and why people ought not be forced to go through it .
<Sync time="187.680"/>
if you're innocent
<Sync time="188.940"/>
getting randomly searched based on your race
<Sync time="191.715"/>
can be incredibly traumatizing .
<Sync time="193.605"/>
given that not only is this often like it physically obnoxious
<Sync time="197.050"/>
system in which we're being patted down and touched by a stranger ,
<Sync time="200.310"/>
but it's also humiliating .
<Sync time="201.890"/>
oftentimes you're in front of people you know and you don't want them to see you in that situation ,
<Sync time="206.015"/>
and
<Sync time="206.435"/>
not only this but you're also often in front of strangers , who you definitely don't want to see you in this situation .
<Sync time="211.820"/>
it also teaches children to be afraid
<Sync time="213.850"/>
bu-
<Sync time="214.330"/>
like t- teaches children who are
<Sync time="216.060"/>
not of that race to be more afraid of that race ,
<Sync time="219.075"/>
and so raises the general fear in society ,
<Sync time="221.640"/>
and it also ch-
<Sync time="222.705"/>
teaches children
<Sync time="223.895"/>
of that race
<Sync time="225.800"/>
to hate themselves a little bit more ,
<Sync time="227.750"/>
given that
<Sync time="228.430"/>
they are much m-
<Sync time="229.190"/>
th- given that they're being stereotyped and labeled as terrorists
<Sync time="232.895"/>
and it like basically leads
<Sync time="234.915"/>
to them not feeling safe within this nation . for these reasons proud to oppose .
<Sync time="240.790"/>
