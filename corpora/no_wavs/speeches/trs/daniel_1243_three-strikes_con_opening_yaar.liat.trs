we should keep
<Sync time="1.870"/>
three strikes
<Sync time="2.410"/>
laws for a few big reasons .
<Sync time="4.990"/>
first , because
<Sync time="6.460"/>
these crimes are incredibly bad crimes even if they're uh perceived as minor felonies ,
<Sync time="11.715"/>
and they're ones that we need to deter .
<Sync time="13.620"/>
and i think that in addition to the fact these are bad and we need to deter people from doing them ,
<Sync time="18.665"/>
i think that when people commit crimes
<Sync time="21.360"/>
over and over again ,
<Sync time="22.470"/>
there is no reason to believe why they won't keep doing it ,
<Sync time="25.460"/>
so you need to protect the population from these people .
<Sync time="28.210"/>
so ,
<Sync time="28.790"/>
let's talk about these kinds of things .
<Sync time="30.860"/>
i think that
<Sync time="31.900"/>
it's important to first start with an overview , that the reason why we punish people
<Sync time="36.015"/>
uh when we we uh give people prison sentences
<Sync time="38.660"/>
isn't just to punish people .
<Sync time="40.440"/>
if you murder someone ,
<Sync time="42.100"/>
we're not putting you in prison just because you deserve a punishment for doing a bad thing .
<Sync time="46.760"/>
we're also doing
<Sync time="48.130"/>
we also have laws in place because we don't want people to do these things in the first place ,
<Sync time="52.920"/>
and because we want people who are willing to do these kind of things to stay away from the rest of society , to not be able to murder or hurt more people .
<Sync time="61.090"/>
so ,
<Sync time="61.740"/>
that's what
<Sync time="62.680"/>
this is going to be about , about deterrence and about isolation of people for protection . so ,
<Sync time="66.665"/>
let's first start by talking about deterrence .
<Sync time="68.785"/>

<Sync time="69.800"/>
i think that it's important to note that
<Sync time="71.760"/>
these crimes are oftentimes bad
<Sync time="73.860"/>
harms , and that there's never really a victimless crime .
<Sync time="76.910"/>
um
<Sync time="77.245"/>
even if it's seen as like a minor felony , and you're just getting a long prison sentence for uh in accumulation of minor felonies ,
<Sync time="83.710"/>
minor felony can be things like
<Sync time="85.760"/>
minor theft of things , so like someone's computer or like
<Sync time="89.525"/>
j- j- robbing a store .
<Sync time="91.190"/>
it could mean
<Sync time="92.040"/>
uh minor uh
<Sync time="93.280"/>
it could be like
<Sync time="93.920"/>
minor instances of assault , where you like
<Sync time="95.890"/>
uh you like
<Sync time="96.630"/>
abuse
<Sync time="97.490"/>
several women , or like your girlfriend a couple of ti- like uh at various points in time .
<Sync time="101.760"/>
these are things that are still severe uh in my opinion , and these are things that are worthy of being punished .
<Sync time="107.210"/>
i think that
<Sync time="108.350"/>
therefore you want to stop people from doing these things , and i think that the best way to do that
<Sync time="113.455"/>
is by a greater deterrence threat , because
<Sync time="116.150"/>
when there's a perceived lack of importance given to like the severity of these crimes , that is because of the fact that they're associated with only small minor prison sentences ,
<Sync time="126.680"/>
possibly for felony it could just be probation or things like that , or parole or whatever .
<Sync time="131.575"/>
and i think that therefore , when you say if you keep doing something you're going to be punished for twenty five years to life in prison ,
<Sync time="138.940"/>
it says that the accumulation of keep doing these felonies over and over again does not suggest that
<Sync time="143.990"/>
it could be tolerated , and i think that
<Sync time="145.600"/>
people are going to be less likely to commit these crimes , because they're going to have greater punishment associated with them .
<Sync time="151.080"/>
people are going to recognize and internalize the consequences of these
<Sync time="154.615"/>
uh
<Sync time="155.310"/>
so called minor felonies that they're committing. 
<Sync time="158.150"/>
but i also think that this is important as far as
<Sync time="160.240"/>
isolating people uh
<Sync time="161.790"/>
and protecting the population .
<Sync time="163.650"/>
it's important to note that
<Sync time="165.450"/>
if someone commits the same crime
<Sync time="167.830"/>
or a similar crime or a similar felony three times ,
<Sync time="171.880"/>
there's no reason to really believe why they're not just going to keep doing this t-
<Sync time="176.140"/>
crime over and over again . like if you get caught doing a bad thing
<Sync time="179.490"/>
three times ,
<Sync time="180.500"/>
i don't understand why they wouldn't do it a fourth time or a fifth time , and this is bad because this mea- because every additional time is
<Sync time="187.035"/>
another person that's getting assaulted , another person that's getting stolen from .
<Sync time="190.755"/>
these are things that the government has an obligation to stop and an obligation to protect people from .
<Sync time="195.550"/>
and i think that that's therefore a very logical grounds to put someone in prison longer , if you can't trust that person to not keep stealing , to not keep hurting people ,
<Sync time="205.810"/>
then they should be imprisoned for a longer amount of time .
<Sync time="208.515"/>
and
<Sync time="209.135"/>
you're by isolating this person from the rest of the population ,
<Sync time="212.160"/>
it means that they can't steal from someone a fourth time or a fifth time .
<Sync time="215.335"/>
so ,
<Sync time="216.380"/>
three strikes laws
<Sync time="217.340"/>
help
<Sync time="217.740"/>
people doing that , and they make sure that the people are actually protected better .
<Sync time="221.370"/>
and
<Sync time="222.015"/>
for all those reasons , we should definitely keep three strikes laws .
<Sync time="227.059"/>
