i stand in firm opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.640"/>
we should subsidize biofuels .
<Sync time="5.890"/>
although they have the name
<Sync time="7.300"/>
bio in the name and
<Sync time="8.805"/>
although many individuals like to pretend as though biofuels are more efficient or better for the environment ,
<Sync time="14.650"/>
most biofuels are actually worse than fossil fuels .
<Sync time="18.650"/>
ethanol in particular which is made from corn
<Sync time="21.800"/>
leads to massive over use of the corn population
<Sync time="25.800"/>
and generally leads to many of the same harms
<Sync time="28.810"/>
as fossil fuels .
<Sync time="30.340"/>
when government decides to step in and subsidize it ,
<Sync time="33.215"/>
it disrupts the market
<Sync time="34.830"/>
and harms the environment as well .
<Sync time="37.205"/>
i have two arguments in today's debate .
<Sync time="40.350"/>
first , that biofuels are inefficient
<Sync time="42.465"/>
and secondly , that they are bad for the environment .
<Sync time="45.125"/>

<Sync time="45.880"/>
on the inefficiency of biofuels ,
<Sync time="47.915"/>
i'm gonna discuss why the market is the best way in which to determine
<Sync time="52.450"/>
the price of certain goods and why stepping is generally bad .
<Sync time="55.455"/>
that the market can capture the vast majority of information
<Sync time="59.500"/>
prices determine the harms in which certain individuals take to produce a good
<Sync time="64.480"/>
and the benefits which the consumer gets from consuming that good .
<Sync time="67.670"/>
the only time in which we ought to subsidize a particular technology is when there are externalities which cannot be captured .
<Sync time="74.335"/>

<Sync time="75.010"/>
recognize that biofuels are
<Sync time="77.130"/>
are an alternative primarily to fossil fuels
<Sync time="79.630"/>
but
<Sync time="80.040"/>
biofuels do not produce
<Sync time="81.880"/>
generally less c_o two or other problematic
<Sync time="85.420"/>
uh
<Sync time="86.045"/>
things than fossil fuels .
<Sync time="88.440"/>
what this means is that the government is deciding to subsidize the particular usage
<Sync time="92.485"/>
of biofuels
<Sync time="93.920"/>
even though
<Sync time="95.240"/>
it is really not any better than fossil fuel .
<Sync time="97.880"/>
we are paying out of our pocket
<Sync time="99.670"/>
in order to allow certain people to buy fuel cheaper .
<Sync time="102.370"/>
additionally ,
<Sync time="103.800"/>
convincing individuals to bio this
<Sync time="105.890"/>
buy this fuel because it's
<Sync time="107.000"/>
decrease in price will also be bad .
<Sync time="109.270"/>
ethanol is incredibly inefficient .
<Sync time="111.000"/>
it's less productive
<Sync time="112.800"/>
per gallon
<Sync time="113.800"/>
than your average thing of oil .
<Sync time="117.420"/>
using this sort of biofuel will do little more
<Sync time="120.425"/>
than harm the environment , disrupt the market , and decrease our quality of life .
<Sync time="124.230"/>
markets are incredibly effective at determining the best good for society writ large
<Sync time="129.065"/>
and changing that price
<Sync time="130.740"/>
also harms society . it will lead to
<Sync time="132.770"/>
overproduction
<Sync time="133.980"/>
and over consumption based on what the optimal usage is
<Sync time="137.610"/>
and the taxpayer will pay for it .
<Sync time="140.280"/>
as such , we ought not subsidize biofuel because it is incredibly inefficient in this regard .
<Sync time="144.970"/>
now my second argument is that biofuel is bad for the environment
<Sync time="148.340"/>
for two main reasons .
<Sync time="150.100"/>
first , it is incredibly difficult to make .
<Sync time="152.160"/>
when you take into account the environmental costs of growing corn , growing
<Sync time="156.875"/>
any other kind of fuel ,
<Sync time="158.485"/>
and then changing it into a usable form such that it can be used in cars or in industry ,
<Sync time="164.745"/>
the ultimate cost is incredibly high .
<Sync time="167.890"/>
it causes
<Sync time="169.270"/>
uh much more c_o two , causes much more greenhouse gas emissions , and causes much more environmental degradation
<Sync time="175.560"/>
than your average production of oil .
<Sync time="177.790"/>
even in cases of fracking ,
<Sync time="180.610"/>
what uh
<Sync time="182.225"/>
these biofuels do is leach into the environment
<Sync time="185.550"/>
and leach in
<Sync time="186.715"/>
to the environment through the pesticides used to grow them
<Sync time="189.120"/>
and then cost massive amounts to make in the first place .
<Sync time="192.450"/>
the current subsidies of biofuel are incredibly inefficient and have generally been opposed .
<Sync time="197.470"/>
the only reason they haven't been absolutely removed is the lobbying power of the agricultural industry and the oil industry
<Sync time="203.395"/>
which
<Sync time="203.905"/>
honestly do not have the best interest of the people at heart .
<Sync time="207.130"/>
the second reason it's bad for the environment is it removes alternatives .
<Sync time="210.940"/>
we think it's incredibly problematic that we remove alternative
<Sync time="214.025"/>
forms of fuel
<Sync time="215.470"/>
uh
<Sync time="215.995"/>
then biofuel and regular gasoline .
<Sync time="218.780"/>
what i mean by this is that the reason we have pushes toward things like tesla or electric cars in general is because of increasing prices
<Sync time="225.635"/>
of fuel .
<Sync time="227.160"/>
subsidizing biofuel , trying to make it a
<Sync time="229.615"/>
hip and cheaper alternative to all other forms
<Sync time="232.925"/>
of uh transportation
<Sync time="234.570"/>
will ultimately make it so things like electric cars or
<Sync time="238.075"/>
hybrid cars will fall in popularity .
<Sync time="240.970"/>
this is incredibly problematic because this is the only way that we can decrease our footstep
<Sync time="245.645"/>
in terms of transportation . as such , we should not subsidize biofuels .
<Sync time="253.589"/>
