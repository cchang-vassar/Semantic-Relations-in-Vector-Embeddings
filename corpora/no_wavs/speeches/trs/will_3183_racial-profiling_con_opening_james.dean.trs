i'm proud to stand in opposition of the motion that we should increase racial profiling in airports .
<Sync time="6.150"/>
our first independent point
<Sync time="7.900"/>
is that there are rights violations intrinsic to this practice .
<Sync time="11.900"/>
so , first we think that these are fundamentally arbitrary practices
<Sync time="16.435"/>
that um
<Sync time="18.120"/>
while there is certainly a stereotype of our minds and perhaps even a statistical correlation
<Sync time="22.920"/>
of like black and brown individuals being more likely to commit these crimes ,
<Sync time="27.170"/>
we don't think that
<Sync time="28.130"/>
a , it is to an extent that is significantly higher enough that warrants mass uh rights violations inflicted upon people of
<Sync time="35.890"/>
these races
<Sync time="36.835"/>
but b ,
<Sync time="37.970"/>
we don't think that the crimes of the few should make the many suffer .
<Sync time="41.440"/>
that is to say that just because a few individuals of middle eastern descent
<Sync time="45.660"/>
are you know
<Sync time="46.620"/>
members of terrorist cells that inflict harm upon others ,
<Sync time="49.590"/>
that doesn't justify subjecting the
<Sync time="51.665"/>
hundreds of millions of people that happen to be of the same race
<Sync time="55.420"/>
to um enhanced interrogation techniques essentially .
<Sync time="59.270"/>
so specifically what is the nature of the rights violations that we're looking at ?
<Sync time="63.570"/>
i think
<Sync time="64.260"/>
it's interesting when government tells you
<Sync time="66.780"/>
oh we're not going to strip search
<Sync time="68.680"/>
or uh like
<Sync time="69.860"/>
%hes do any of those other over the top things
<Sync time="72.005"/>
we're just going to be engaging in enhanced searching .
<Sync time="75.170"/>
so i want to clarify
<Sync time="77.015"/>
that if
<Sync time="77.890"/>
enhanced searching isn't strip searches and other stuff like that , i really don't know what it is
<Sync time="84.190"/>
because like absent the thing where they just kind of like swab your hands down like that's it
<Sync time="88.770"/>
like that
<Sync time="89.400"/>
that that's what enhanced searching is . when they pull you over in line like
<Sync time="93.505"/>
that's what they're going to do .
<Sync time="95.205"/>
so i think it's important then
<Sync time="97.390"/>
to recognize that there is a significant burden placed upon innocent individuals who have done nothing wrong
<Sync time="103.130"/>
and simply happen to share a skin color with people have done something wrong .
<Sync time="107.105"/>
that in and of itself is a rights violation ,
<Sync time="109.740"/>
specifically a violation of
<Sync time="111.815"/>
one's rights to privacy
<Sync time="113.510"/>
that is um
<Sync time="114.540"/>
insofar as privacy is you know
<Sync time="116.820"/>
key to a lot of other rights like the ability to you know do is one please without fear of retaliation unnecessarily ,
<Sync time="123.575"/>
but it's also a violation of one's right to bodily autonomy , to have
<Sync time="127.035"/>
as one pleases done to one's body .
<Sync time="129.670"/>
um we think that you know strip searches especially are extremely invasive
<Sync time="134.150"/>
um and definitely constitute a significant rights violation in terms of that .
<Sync time="138.270"/>
again ,
<Sync time="139.140"/>
it is probably fair for gov to say that these individual violations don't amount to the same as an individual right to life for example that stems from like an airplane attack .
<Sync time="149.340"/>
we also think that these attacks are so rare that it in the aggregate
<Sync time="152.900"/>
um the rights violations that come from random interrogations probably outweigh the significance of like those
<Sync time="158.870"/>
like another nine-eleven as is demonstrated by the fact that nine-eleven was like sixteen years ago .
<Sync time="164.880"/>
our second independent point is that
<Sync time="167.010"/>
racial profiling isn't effective .
<Sync time="169.160"/>
um it's easy to dodge
<Sync time="170.670"/>
because if you just
<Sync time="172.340"/>
recruit people that don't match the profile
<Sync time="175.560"/>
then you can just have them carry out the attacks instead .
<Sync time="178.470"/>
like isis has white people
<Sync time="180.175"/>
and those white people can just conduct the attacks
<Sync time="183.020"/>
if really explicit racial profiling
<Sync time="185.670"/>
actively distracts the t_s_a from looking into people who aren't brown .
<Sync time="190.570"/>
given that , we think it's just like a
<Sync time="192.105"/>
bad way of ensuring safety
<Sync time="194.580"/>
and at that point then i think a lot of govs offense about specifically protecting innocents right to life
<Sync time="200.270"/>
falls through .
<Sync time="201.300"/>
if anything , this is the worse tactic of insuring people safety
<Sync time="205.390"/>
and as such
<Sync time="206.070"/>
actively infringes upon those rights .
<Sync time="208.715"/>
our third independent point is the narrative that centers around racial profiling .
<Sync time="213.760"/>
so ,
<Sync time="214.380"/>
specifically , govs gives them lip service to the notion that
<Sync time="217.405"/>
you know we'd rather have racial profiling happen explicitly than implicitly , implying that racial profiling is something that happens anyway .
<Sync time="225.910"/>
i think the problem here
<Sync time="227.670"/>
is that when it happens explicitly ,
<Sync time="229.850"/>
that's actually a boon for recruiting for terrorist cells .
<Sync time="233.370"/>
um terrorist cells specifically do the recruiting on the basis that people feel alienated from society at large
<Sync time="239.560"/>
and specifically individuals of middle eastern descent
<Sync time="242.330"/>
often feel the effects of islamophobia in a very real and tangible way .
<Sync time="246.800"/>
cells like al qaeda and isis then utilize that sense of alienation to recruit individuals into being terrorists .
<Sync time="253.840"/>
this of course
<Sync time="254.780"/>
is a huge driving force in their ability to conduct attacks ,
<Sync time="258.180"/>
so we think it's problematic then when things that could easily be cast as blatant islamophobia
<Sync time="263.155"/>
are able to be shaped into that narrative
<Sync time="265.755"/>
and are able to you
<Sync time="267.010"/>
be used to affirm the notion that isis says you know
<Sync time="269.980"/>
you are an outcast of society , join us and we'll fight against the oppressors . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="275.824"/>
