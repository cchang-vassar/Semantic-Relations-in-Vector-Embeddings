sex education
<Sync time="2.235"/>
should be mandatory .
<Sync time="4.100"/>
so in this debate , i think that we're talking about
<Sync time="6.525"/>
sex education ,
<Sync time="7.930"/>
things like condom use ,
<Sync time="9.520"/>
uh teaching children about
<Sync time="11.620"/>
pregnancy ,
<Sync time="12.650"/>
how to avoid s_t_d's , things like that .
<Sync time="15.330"/>
uh and we're talking about this
<Sync time="16.600"/>
in state run schools .
<Sync time="18.280"/>
so ,
<Sync time="18.780"/>
when we say mandatory , we think that , you know , this would be a class ,
<Sync time="21.770"/>
probably offered in health , or gym class ,
<Sync time="24.075"/>
at a school .
<Sync time="25.540"/>
so two big arguments for you , but they're both about
<Sync time="28.135"/>
individual health .
<Sync time="29.745"/>
so before we get into those two arguments , i just want to say that , we think that the state
<Sync time="33.490"/>
has a compelling interest in
<Sync time="35.365"/>
better individual health .
<Sync time="37.270"/>
young people , who are healthy ,
<Sync time="39.500"/>
are going to be better workers in the future , so the hope to grow the economy ,
<Sync time="43.540"/>
if it's a developing country , they're going to help your country to develop .
<Sync time="46.620"/>
and on top of that ,
<Sync time="47.880"/>
since states ultimately pay for health care , through things like
<Sync time="50.940"/>
national health in britain ,
<Sync time="52.690"/>
we think that ,
<Sync time="53.655"/>
ultimately the state has a compelling interest to limit its expenses ,
<Sync time="57.040"/>
with regard
<Sync time="57.985"/>
to
<Sync time="58.555"/>
sexual health .
<Sync time="60.160"/>
two big arguments then , the first is about
<Sync time="62.230"/>
how this limits teen pregnancies .
<Sync time="65.230"/>
we think that , most teen pregnancies are ultimately caused by ignorance .
<Sync time="69.830"/>
young people who don't understand
<Sync time="72.260"/>
uh how teen pregnancy actually works ,
<Sync time="75.050"/>
because they haven't been educated by their parents , who might be
<Sync time="77.605"/>
conservative or religious , or even parents
<Sync time="80.375"/>
who don't fully understand
<Sync time="82.080"/>
uh sexual health
<Sync time="83.520"/>
on their own ,
<Sync time="84.350"/>
because they weren't educated in the past .
<Sync time="86.425"/>
so , we think that many young women , in particular , are really grossly harmed , because
<Sync time="91.545"/>
they have unprotected sex , they don't understand
<Sync time="94.525"/>
the risks of getting pregnant , and then suddenly
<Sync time="96.885"/>
they have a child , and their community
<Sync time="99.150"/>
wants them to
<Sync time="99.980"/>
drop out of school , and raise that child ,
<Sync time="102.410"/>
so ultimately , their education gets put on hold ,
<Sync time="105.020"/>
they've a hard time getting a good job ,
<Sync time="106.890"/>
and their future
<Sync time="107.860"/>
earnings are greatly decreased , their ability to
<Sync time="111.055"/>
you know go on to
<Sync time="112.200"/>
improve their own standard of living of their family standard of living is really decreased .
<Sync time="116.445"/>
we see that , this has
<Sync time="117.515"/>
huge impacts on these people , especially teenage girls ,
<Sync time="120.875"/>
as a result of teenage pregnancy .
<Sync time="123.130"/>
but , it's relatively easy to educate people about how to avoid
<Sync time="126.410"/>
uh pregnancy . you know , everything that you learned in school , especially condom use i think , is going to be important here .
<Sync time="131.505"/>

<Sync time="132.630"/>
many
<Sync time="133.225"/>
young people , even in very developed countries like the u_s ,
<Sync time="136.570"/>
their parents don't teach them anything about condom use ,
<Sync time="139.330"/>
they might know that condoms exist ,
<Sync time="141.190"/>
but perhaps they don't understand how to safely apply them ,
<Sync time="144.280"/>
or when to use them .
<Sync time="145.650"/>
so ultimately ,
<Sync time="146.480"/>
teen pregnancies , that are easily prevented through condom use ,
<Sync time="149.525"/>
are not going to be prevented , and that's to say nothing about
<Sync time="152.590"/>
forms of birth control , that young woman might not even know exist .
<Sync time="155.870"/>
a lot of them probably know about the pill in developed countries , but in many developing countries , they might just be completely ignorant of the pill's existence .
<Sync time="163.055"/>
and in the u_s , they may have a lot of stereotypes , or
<Sync time="165.910"/>
misinformation from the media about it ,
<Sync time="168.320"/>
that would limit their ability to get on something , that could really help them to
<Sync time="171.305"/>
take control of their own life , not only with regards to pregnancy , but also with regard
<Sync time="175.335"/>
to regulating menstruation .
<Sync time="177.190"/>
ultimately we think that ,
<Sync time="178.260"/>
you really empower young women as a result 
<Sync time="180.340"/>
of sexual education .
<Sync time="182.240"/>
our second argument then is about how this limits
<Sync time="184.890"/>
s_t_d's . so ,
<Sync time="186.650"/>
you- everybody today is very concerned about the spread of h_i_v and aids ,
<Sync time="191.485"/>
and if we look at the regions where
<Sync time="193.260"/>
h_i_v
<Sync time="194.110"/>
has spread the most rapidly , it's in areas with very limited sexual education .
<Sync time="198.365"/>

<Sync time="198.915"/>
if you look at it in the u_s , it's been mostly in the gay community that , people been really affected by this awful disease .
<Sync time="205.280"/>
the reason why that's probably true ,
<Sync time="207.200"/>
is that schools ,
<Sync time="208.970"/>
even up , unfortunately , until the present ,
<Sync time="211.440"/>
don't teach young people about
<Sync time="213.610"/>
uh homosexual
<Sync time="215.415"/>
sexual education .
<Sync time="216.770"/>
they only focus on heterosexual
<Sync time="218.805"/>
sexual education , which means that young people
<Sync time="221.160"/>
aren't informed about how to avoid
<Sync time="222.950"/>
getting an s_t_d , they don't know that they need to use condoms , and things like that ,
<Sync time="226.720"/>
with homosexual intercourse .
<Sync time="228.385"/>
so ultimately , we think that , sex ed should be mandatory to limit the spread of s_t_d's , not only ,
<Sync time="233.015"/>
you know obviously , nobody wants an s_t_d , but especially
<Sync time="235.890"/>
things like h_i_v ,
<Sync time="237.335"/>
they can actually be life threatening in the future , and obviously they'd run up a huge cost for the government , in the forms of treatment .
<Sync time="243.400"/>
so , because we better stop teen pregnancies , and empower young women , and because we limit the spread of h_i_v ,
<Sync time="248.730"/>
sex education should be mandatory ,
<Sync time="250.790"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="251.389"/>
