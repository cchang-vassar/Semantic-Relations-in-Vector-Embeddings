two things in this debate :
<Sync time="1.940"/>
one , on how blocks 
<Sync time="3.850"/>
bring more power to the region , 
<Sync time="5.935"/>
and two , on how economic dependence between nations
<Sync time="9.420"/>
is a good thing .
<Sync time="10.440"/>
particularly
<Sync time="11.570"/>
in an otherwise rather tense
<Sync time="13.845"/>
region of the world . 
<Sync time="15.900"/>
a few points of refutation to yaar :
<Sync time="18.340"/>
before we go to the arguments .
<Sync time="20.470"/>
one , yaar
<Sync time="21.490"/>
starts out with the assumption that this has been tried for years and has failed . 
<Sync time="25.670"/>
we're not entirely sure where he gets the notion that it's failed . 
<Sync time="28.970"/>
he goes on to tell you that
<Sync time="30.670"/>
countries like singapore and malaysia are some of the
<Sync time="33.500"/>
richest countries in the world . 
<Sync time="35.380"/>
that's because their g_d_p has been rising for years
<Sync time="38.840"/>
that doesn't seem like failure . 
<Sync time="41.480"/>
also , these countries
<Sync time="43.200"/>
haven't had a war between them
<Sync time="45.040"/>
in years .
<Sync time="45.990"/>
also probably a good thing .
<Sync time="48.500"/>
like , we're not sure what the mark of success yaar is trying to reach is , but it seems
<Sync time="53.065"/>
that these
<Sync time="53.840"/>
countries are at least partially
<Sync time="55.940"/>
doing well .
<Sync time="56.830"/>
that may be a marker of success .
<Sync time="59.540"/>
two ,
<Sync time="60.390"/>
yaar says : look , there's no unifying factor .
<Sync time="64.780"/>
that's exactly the point .
<Sync time="66.420"/>
see yaar never tells you why
<Sync time="68.140"/>
religion or a type of governance
<Sync time="71.080"/>
is the
<Sync time="71.820"/>
form of unifying factor . what it tells you is
<Sync time="74.850"/>
in order for countries to
<Sync time="76.940"/>
care for each other , to cooperate
<Sync time="79.890"/>
they need a reason . 
<Sync time="81.620"/>
something that unifies them .
<Sync time="84.580"/>
crucially ,
<Sync time="85.460"/>
we see no reason why this unifying factor
<Sync time="88.360"/>
can't be invented . 
<Sync time="90.420"/>
we think the a_s_e_a_n
<Sync time="92.060"/>
is exactly that
<Sync time="94.160"/>
unifying factor .
<Sync time="96.050"/>
by signing these agreements by signing these accords
<Sync time="99.560"/>
they are
<Sync time="100.030"/>
actively creating a unifying factor . 
<Sync time="103.640"/>
something that
<Sync time="104.800"/>
if they win they all win and if they lose they all lose .
<Sync time="108.715"/>
this is the way that countries
<Sync time="111.045"/>
unite together
<Sync time="112.950"/>
regardless of history .
<Sync time="115.440"/>
we think that's a great unifying factor . 
<Sync time="117.500"/>

<Sync time="118.700"/>
thirdly yaar says there's imbalance in a_s_e_a_n . some of the countries are rich
<Sync time="123.290"/>
some of them are poor
<Sync time="125.080"/>
and that creates tensions . he's sort of right .
<Sync time="127.895"/>
you have to compare to the counter factual .
<Sync time="130.930"/>
it's not like outside of a_s_e_a_n thailand would've been rich .
<Sync time="134.390"/>
they would've been poor and probably would have been substantially
<Sync time="137.230"/>
poorer.
<Sync time="137.945"/>
and it's not like that wouldn't have gone to
<Sync time="139.920"/>
singapore and malaysia
<Sync time="141.260"/>
for
<Sync time="141.750"/>
money and for assistance because they would have needed the assistance .
<Sync time="145.030"/>
the only problem is it would have had to re-negotiate that assistance
<Sync time="148.560"/>
time and time again .
<Sync time="150.040"/>
they would've been turned down half the time .
<Sync time="152.500"/>
that's the kind of thing that creates
<Sync time="155.020"/>
uncomfort .
<Sync time="156.340"/>
that's the kind of thing
<Sync time="158.130"/>
that creates tensions between two countries . so they're right to an extent , the fact that some of the countries are richer and some of the countries are poorer
<Sync time="165.440"/>
creates tensions , but it's the kind of tensions you get
<Sync time="168.125"/>
between
<Sync time="168.890"/>
your older brother and younger brother ,
<Sync time="171.540"/>
not the kind of tensions you get between a poor person
<Sync time="174.380"/>
and the bank .
<Sync time="175.510"/>
and that's what we're trying to keep .
<Sync time="177.515"/>
first argument : blocks bring more power .
<Sync time="180.480"/>
by uniting in a_s_e_a_n they've created more than just
<Sync time="184.735"/>
an
<Sync time="185.360"/>
economic
<Sync time="186.315"/>
agreement . they've also created
<Sync time="188.115"/>
a voting block . this voting block is beneficial to them
<Sync time="191.755"/>
in more than just a_s_e_a_n but also outside of it
<Sync time="195.420"/>
in places like the u_n or in places like
<Sync time="198.415"/>
w_t_o . 
<Sync time="200.385"/>
this is massively beneficial to each and every one of these countries because alone
<Sync time="204.890"/>
they are very weak in voting power but together they actually have some sort of influence on a global
<Sync time="210.675"/>
level . secondly , economic dependence between nations
<Sync time="213.780"/>
in a tense region
<Sync time="215.010"/>
is a very good thing .
<Sync time="217.190"/>
if you look at what happens
<Sync time="219.770"/>
in
<Sync time="220.245"/>
a lot of the rest of asia
<Sync time="222.600"/>
there are
<Sync time="223.225"/>
tensions between countries . the reason there are tensions between countries
<Sync time="227.245"/>
is because there's a battle between countries over resources ,
<Sync time="230.610"/>
over land , over geographical areas .
<Sync time="233.085"/>
at the point at which you're economically dependent on other nations within the region
<Sync time="237.740"/>
the likelihood of tensions between those nations
<Sync time="240.230"/>
drops significantly
<Sync time="242.225"/>
and that we think is one of the most crucial things that any accords do .
<Sync time="246.560"/>
please continue to support a_s_e_a_n . 
<Sync time="249.754"/>
