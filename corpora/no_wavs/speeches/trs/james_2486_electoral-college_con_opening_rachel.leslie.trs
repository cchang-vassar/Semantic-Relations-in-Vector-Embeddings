the united states should not abolish the electoral college .
<Sync time="4.475"/>

<Sync time="5.060"/>
we think that
<Sync time="5.940"/>
the current system
<Sync time="7.180"/>
as it exists in the status quo
<Sync time="8.990"/>
ought to be continued in the future
<Sync time="11.200"/>
for two reasons .
<Sync time="12.380"/>
the first is that the american democracy is very robust and successful already
<Sync time="17.475"/>
and that if something isn't broken we ought not change it .
<Sync time="20.900"/>
the united states has had more peaceful transitions of power than any other democratic country in the world as far as i'm aware .
<Sync time="28.475"/>
uh
<Sync time="29.170"/>
we've had one civil war , to be sure , but ultimately , over the last two hundred and some odd years ,
<Sync time="34.710"/>
the country has proven very robust
<Sync time="36.780"/>
using the existing system
<Sync time="38.470"/>
for electing the president .
<Sync time="40.200"/>
at that point , we don't think that the system should be changed ,
<Sync time="43.310"/>
especially when many other countries which use
<Sync time="45.750"/>
a popular vote system
<Sync time="47.530"/>
have had fewer transitions of power peacefully
<Sync time="50.250"/>
or have ha- been much more prone to civil conflict
<Sync time="53.690"/>
due to their electoral systems .
<Sync time="55.870"/>
so
<Sync time="56.865"/>
at the point where the united states has proven able to select a president who is broadly palatable
<Sync time="61.965"/>
to most of the american people ,
<Sync time="63.840"/>
using the electoral college , it seems foolish to abolish it .
<Sync time="67.425"/>

<Sync time="68.210"/>
rachel points out many flaws in the system
<Sync time="70.270"/>
such as that it isn't
<Sync time="71.700"/>
perfectly
<Sync time="72.480"/>
allocated according to popular will ,
<Sync time="74.800"/>
but we think that , actually , the electoral college does a really good job of balancing popular will with regional representation .
<Sync time="81.610"/>
on the one hand ,
<Sync time="82.840"/>
states are allocated seats primarily according to their population .
<Sync time="86.780"/>
you get two votes
<Sync time="88.380"/>
automatically in the electoral college ,
<Sync time="90.365"/>
and any subsequent votes
<Sync time="92.105"/>
are based on population .
<Sync time="93.420"/>
so california has over fifty votes because so many people live there .
<Sync time="98.870"/>
what this means is that ultimately ,
<Sync time="101.275"/>
uh we balance the interests of small and populous states .
<Sync time="104.690"/>
now you might say
<Sync time="105.890"/>
uh who cares about these small states like wyoming , as rachel does .
<Sync time="109.510"/>
but ultimately , the united states is a federal republic , and that means that we have to consider the wishes of every member of the federation
<Sync time="116.330"/>
because they're all equal states ,
<Sync time="118.205"/>
and legally speaking ,
<Sync time="119.630"/>
the united states' sovereignty is derived from the collective sovereignty
<Sync time="123.130"/>
of all of the fifty states .
<Sync time="125.030"/>
so we can't just ignore some of them , like wyoming ,
<Sync time="127.620"/>
even if they have very small populations .
<Sync time="130.490"/>
now ,
<Sync time="130.870"/>
rachel's correct that wyoming has a smaller population than
<Sync time="133.660"/>
most large american cities ,
<Sync time="135.625"/>
but that doesn't change the fact that it has equal sovereignty with california ,
<Sync time="139.440"/>
which has sixty times more people .
<Sync time="141.560"/>
so that's a facet of our legal system ,
<Sync time="144.050"/>
but because the current system has produced so much stability
<Sync time="146.910"/>
and prosperity
<Sync time="148.025"/>
and is still generally democratic ,
<Sync time="150.015"/>
we don't think it ought be abandoned .
<Sync time="152.350"/>
you're throwing out the baby with the bath water
<Sync time="154.790"/>
if you get rid of the electoral college .
<Sync time="157.100"/>
and this leads nicely into my next point which is that the replacement system would not be better .
<Sync time="162.380"/>
i don't know why rachel thinks that the american government would come up with a fair and representative system to replace the electoral college .
<Sync time="170.160"/>
remember that this is a country where almost every representative is elected from gerrymandered districts
<Sync time="175.575"/>
which are deliberately drawn to negate the ability of people to actually control who their representative is .
<Sync time="181.570"/>
so at the point where our lawmakers are elected by gerrymandered districts and have a vested interest in preventing the american people
<Sync time="189.120"/>
from having a lot of control over elections ,
<Sync time="191.970"/>
there's no reason to assume that they wouldn't come up with some ridiculous and unfair method
<Sync time="196.430"/>
of selecting the president .
<Sync time="198.025"/>
perhaps they would have the president be elected by the house of representatives and the senate
<Sync time="203.100"/>
rather like how prime ministers are selected
<Sync time="205.285"/>
in countries like france .
<Sync time="207.070"/>
but this would just transfer power farther away from the people
<Sync time="209.965"/>
and make gerrymandering effective at the presidency
<Sync time="212.725"/>
as well as in
<Sync time="213.850"/>
other respects .
<Sync time="216.210"/>
or perhaps they would come up with some system whereby it was based entirely on popular will ,
<Sync time="221.290"/>
and people from most of the country would have
<Sync time="223.360"/>
no input at all .
<Sync time="225.220"/>
perhaps they would come up with a system that made it even easier to prevent minorities from voting and having their vote counted .
<Sync time="230.880"/>
it's difficult to a-
<Sync time="231.920"/>
argue the alternative would be better
<Sync time="234.110"/>
given that the people who would be designing the alternative
<Sync time="236.850"/>
are corrupt and don't have the best interest of the american people at heart .
<Sync time="241.050"/>
so for all these reasons , we should not abolish the electoral college .
<Sync time="244.470"/>
thank you .
