<Sync time="2.905"/>
i'm proud to stand in opposition of today's motion
<Sync time="5.240"/>
that boxing has to be
<Sync time="6.510"/>
baned .
<Sync time="6.985"/>
so first with regards to the model , i think it's important to recognize that it is within ops ground to say
<Sync time="12.070"/>
this is a thing that can be regulated .
<Sync time="14.180"/>
this is a thing that we can actually take proactive steps to make safer because that's the trajectory of history .
<Sync time="19.460"/>
sports overtime have become safer . things like football , for example , where you have to wear helmets now and that didn't used to be the case awhile ago .
<Sync time="27.120"/>
the like trajectory of history means that these things are going to become safer in the long term .
<Sync time="31.480"/>
so i think you can
<Sync time="32.440"/>
like ignore a decent amount of government's arguments on face value as a result of that because the trajectory of history means that the harms that they talk about are more likely than not going to disappear in the long term
<Sync time="42.830"/>
but absent that ,
<Sync time="44.265"/>
there's three independent points that i'd like to announce today .
<Sync time="46.850"/>
first that this provides an opportunity for wealth and a
<Sync time="49.885"/>
positive mindset or opportu-
<Sync time="51.740"/>
or
<Sync time="52.295"/>
optimistic mindset
<Sync time="53.675"/>
for minorities and other historically disadvantaged people who are able to take this as an opportunity to achieve some form
<Sync time="59.410"/>
of wealth .
<Sync time="59.840"/>
secondly , that the violence is demanded at its
<Sync time="62.840"/>
zero sum level and as a result of this it is unlikely that abolishing boxing is actually going to meaningfully solve for the societal harm that they talk about ,
<Sync time="70.340"/>
and thirdly , that there is just a non-zero pleasure from viewing that exists as a result of this that is worth voting on .
<Sync time="76.095"/>
so
<Sync time="76.870"/>
with regards to the first argument that this provides a path to riches
<Sync time="80.590"/>
they tell you
<Sync time="81.600"/>
ons side government that
<Sync time="82.890"/>
this is not a thing really that
<Sync time="85.170"/>
like pans out most of the time for people who participate in boxing that it is a misleading claim that people are brought down this path .
<Sync time="90.980"/>
so i think two things on that . first ,
<Sync time="92.940"/>
with regards to individuals ,
<Sync time="94.610"/>
there is just benefits when you are a mike tyson that
<Sync time="97.605"/>
actually does get rich on this . this is something that makes your life better . mike tyson used to be very poor , very destitute , having a low quality of life . now he has a high quality of life .
<Sync time="105.670"/>
so on that individual level
<Sync time="107.080"/>
those people are a benefit that exists from the sport .
<Sync time="109.890"/>
those are people who were given opportunities that they didn't previously have .
<Sync time="112.860"/>
but secondly , i think even if this is misleading for the large majority of people
<Sync time="116.980"/>
that
<Sync time="117.330"/>
optimistic mindset that is generated by having this new opportunity
<Sync time="120.850"/>
that's something that's beneficial to them right ?
<Sync time="122.960"/>
it means that your outlook on the world is less pessimistic . it means that
<Sync time="126.030"/>
even though most people of color
<Sync time="128.090"/>
and most children of color are more likely going to succumb
<Sync time="131.390"/>
to the absolute horrors of a racist classes society ,
<Sync time="134.700"/>
it is worth having that optimism
<Sync time="136.650"/>
just on a psychological level . it means that the individual is able to have a higher quality of life because they're not constantly being weighed down by the specter of they're ,
<Sync time="144.350"/>
more likely than not , mistreatment by society .
<Sync time="147.640"/>
second independent argument is the demand for violence is zero sum .
<Sync time="150.430"/>
this is intuitive i think . this is just
<Sync time="152.190"/>
this animalistic saying that is uh sort of a holdover from evolution
<Sync time="156.125"/>
and as a result like this is the reason why we enjoy boxing right ?
<Sync time="159.480"/>
i don't think that goes away when you abolish boxing as an institution .
<Sync time="162.545"/>
that demand either a just transfer to other sports like football or m_m_a or whenever , in which case their arguments are literally non-unique . like there's no benefits that exist on side government .
<Sync time="172.555"/>
or even worse ,
<Sync time="174.190"/>
that violence transfers into like actual day-to-day violence where people have harmful interactions on the streets and things like that .
<Sync time="180.110"/>
i think that's important to recognize then
<Sync time="182.090"/>
because that's an actual increase in the harm that exists to the individual people
<Sync time="185.885"/>
and that's something that's seriously worth being concerned about .
<Sync time="188.950"/>
my third independent point
<Sync time="190.480"/>
is the pleasure that people get from viewing this . now i think it's important to recognize that this is a serious impact right ?
<Sync time="195.930"/>
like a just on scope
<Sync time="197.630"/>
lots of people view boxing because they enjoy it .
<Sync time="200.360"/>
so i think on a day to day basis those individuals have a lower quality of life because this thing that they hold dear and they really really enjoy whether it's something they
<Sync time="208.740"/>
enter a for , you know ,
<Sync time="209.780"/>
animalistic like reasons
<Sync time="211.675"/>
for just because it is a form of escapism or something like that .
<Sync time="215.230"/>
that is still a thing that matters to them
<Sync time="217.520"/>
and creates pleasure within the world .
<Sync time="219.470"/>
so if you analyze this through like a utilitarian framework you you just care about how much the individual benefits from the existence of an institution ,
<Sync time="226.190"/>
then this is the thing that makes the world a slightly better place .
<Sync time="228.910"/>
but secondly , when you recognize that they really don't have offense because they don't solve for systemic violence ,
<Sync time="234.160"/>
that's just a thing to vote off of because it's the only real benefit of the round .
<Sync time="237.830"/>
given these reasons , i think it's really intuitive
<Sync time="239.860"/>
as to why the track of history means that a their benefits
<Sync time="243.050"/>
aren't going to materialize ,
<Sync time="244.280"/>
but secondly , that there are actual tangible harms to engaging in this .
<Sync time="247.170"/>
as a result of the fact that people do actually benefit from this , that there are individual level
<Sync time="251.510"/>
benefits that exists from boxing
<Sync time="253.330"/>
and abolishing it
<Sync time="254.240"/>
doesn't really solve for the problems , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="257.670"/>
 
<Sync time="260.426"/>
