<Sync time="0.735"/>
the problem with government is that they rely on the idea that the monarchy is full of awful people who are unrepresentative of the democratic whole
<Sync time="8.295"/>
and %unclear to them ideals .
<Sync time="10.490"/>
the problem with this is that they fail to understand exactly how much the monarchy has developed
<Sync time="15.185"/>
and exactly how little power it has .
<Sync time="17.660"/>
first ,
<Sync time="18.450"/>
even the government speaker acknowledges that queen elizabeth has been much more moderate
<Sync time="22.645"/>
and hasn't actually committed any of the atrocities that they claim
<Sync time="26.670"/>
have happened .
<Sync time="27.795"/>
more than this ,
<Sync time="29.210"/>
let me tell you that it is likely that if queen elizabeth or any other member of the monarchy
<Sync time="33.780"/>
were to attempt a political coup ,
<Sync time="35.610"/>
they would quickly be disestablished ,
<Sync time="37.440"/>
because at this point it is accepted that their role is as a figurehead
<Sync time="40.755"/>
and not one that is a political that is political .
<Sync time="43.540"/>
what it comes down to is that the monarchy does very little good ,
<Sync time="46.725"/>
but it also does very little bad .
<Sync time="48.750"/>
we tell you that the
<Sync time="49.740"/>
amount of money and energy that would go into lifting the monarchy
<Sync time="53.490"/>
is thus
<Sync time="54.285"/>
unnecessary and unjustified ,
<Sync time="56.620"/>
given that they aren't actually committing any harm .
<Sync time="59.810"/>
with that ,
<Sync time="60.515"/>
two main areas of clash ,
<Sync time="62.015"/>
the first on public will .
<Sync time="63.930"/>
recent polls have shown that more than
<Sync time="66.160"/>
three to every one person wants to keep the monarchy .
<Sync time="69.820"/>
this means ,
<Sync time="70.670"/>
first , that the majority in a democracy want it to exist .
<Sync time="74.350"/>
this , in itself , should be enough , given that a democratic government is one that accepts the majority will of its population .
<Sync time="80.530"/>
but even if that's not enough ,
<Sync time="82.170"/>
pragmatically it means it would be very socially challenging to disband
<Sync time="85.685"/>
and would cause a lot of
<Sync time="86.705"/>
disfavor to the individual citizens .
<Sync time="88.940"/>
it would be expensive
<Sync time="90.515"/>
and also would cause political anguish
<Sync time="92.850"/>
among those
<Sync time="94.000"/>
among like at least three to every one individual living within the u_k .
<Sync time="98.430"/>
this means it is simply not worth it .
<Sync time="101.390"/>
use this effort
<Sync time="102.500"/>
elsewhere to create real political change that can benefit lives ,
<Sync time="105.860"/>
rather than removing a relic that hasn't actually caused any harm .
<Sync time="109.240"/>
if gov wants to talk about finances ,
<Sync time="111.300"/>
we think that the fact that you would need to create an alternative head of state ,
<Sync time="114.935"/>
fund the overhead costs of that switch in the first ,
<Sync time="118.280"/>
secure i- like maintain security for the crown in the same time ,
<Sync time="122.085"/>
all of this would be equally expensive
<Sync time="124.740"/>
in addition to the costs of having to switch over ,
<Sync time="127.540"/>
and in addition to that , the political turmoil that would occur
<Sync time="130.930"/>
over the
<Sync time="131.765"/>
method of election or selection of this individual .
<Sync time="135.390"/>
our second area of clash
<Sync time="136.850"/>
has to do with why we think that the monarchy
<Sync time="138.990"/>
often serves political good .
<Sync time="140.705"/>
we think that
<Sync time="141.570"/>
as the only beloved part of the government
<Sync time="143.980"/>
in times when there are contentious decisions being made ,
<Sync time="146.930"/>
it is important not to disband it
<Sync time="148.940"/>
and increase political unity
<Sync time="150.520"/>
that you don't see in other states without a monarchy .
<Sync time="153.225"/>
in the united states , there is constant
<Sync time="155.290"/>
anger over the way that congress operates ,
<Sync time="157.910"/>
over the way that the president operates ,
<Sync time="160.205"/>
and oftentimes when this occurs , you see
<Sync time="162.365"/>
massive distrust within the government ,
<Sync time="164.770"/>
in-
<Sync time="165.230"/>
thus fracturing within the nationalism of the population .
<Sync time="168.900"/>
the reason you don't see this happen
<Sync time="170.640"/>
as viciously within england and other u_k states
<Sync time="173.590"/>
is because even when congress is messing up ,
<Sync time="176.470"/>
even when you have problems within branches of the government ,
<Sync time="179.180"/>
you still believe in the queen ,
<Sync time="180.785"/>
you still believe in that figurehead .
<Sync time="183.035"/>
we think that it is
<Sync time="184.970"/>
th- that when there is turmoil
<Sync time="186.730"/>
elsewhere ,
<Sync time="187.400"/>
it is good to promote national unity
<Sync time="189.505"/>
and problematic to take the symbol that does so
<Sync time="192.120"/>
away .
<Sync time="192.925"/>
more than this , we think that the queen
<Sync time="195.090"/>
other members of the monarchy
<Sync time="196.480"/>
are often symbols for charity work and other social good .
<Sync time="199.740"/>
because they are expected and
<Sync time="201.520"/>
turn up at charity events and donate money to good causes and advocate for good causes ,
<Sync time="206.590"/>
we think the population follows .
<Sync time="208.390"/>
much in the way that the first lady of the united states
<Sync time="211.250"/>
often takes up a cause that they advocate for ,
<Sync time="213.705"/>
we think the members of the monarchy
<Sync time="215.380"/>
operate in a sim-
<Sync time="216.260"/>
similar manner .
<Sync time="217.520"/>
they show the members of their state
<Sync time="219.530"/>
how they ought be behaving in a way that is socially good ,
<Sync time="222.435"/>
and others follow .
<Sync time="224.390"/>
finally though ,
<Sync time="225.210"/>
we think that the monarchy attracts tourism in a way that other things
<Sync time="228.410"/>
don't .
<Sync time="228.925"/>
the massive phenomenon of f- following the marriage of the prince and princess
<Sync time="233.510"/>
on screen ,
<Sync time="234.370"/>
live tweeting the event , looking at the outfits that their children are wearing ,
<Sync time="238.310"/>
all of this attracts massive amount of popular r- pop- massive amounts of people
<Sync time="242.945"/>
to the area in order to even catch a glance
<Sync time="245.520"/>
or look at where they live .
<Sync time="247.310"/>
we think that thes- this kind of income is also something that disappears when you abolish the monarchy .
<Sync time="252.300"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="255.620"/>
