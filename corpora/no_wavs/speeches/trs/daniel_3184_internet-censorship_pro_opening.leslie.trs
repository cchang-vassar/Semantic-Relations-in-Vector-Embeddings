we should increase
<Sync time="2.640"/>
internet censorship because
<Sync time="4.885"/>
it will be beneficial in suppressing dangerous ideologies
<Sync time="9.530"/>
and s-
<Sync time="10.240"/>
e- essential in
<Sync time="11.780"/>
suppressing abuse , harassment and bullying .
<Sync time="14.640"/>
so let's start by wh- uh talking about why it's
<Sync time="17.635"/>
um inval- uh invaluable to uh
<Sync time="20.860"/>
suppressing abuse and bullying and harassment .
<Sync time="23.355"/>
and i think that these kinds of
<Sync time="25.445"/>
things are incredibly common on the internet
<Sync time="27.620"/>
assess- especially because you can post anonymously ,
<Sync time="30.815"/>
and
<Sync time="31.330"/>
a lot of these things don't get traced back to you .
<Sync time="33.890"/>
you see
<Sync time="34.700"/>
uh hordes of internet trolls , you see people
<Sync time="37.350"/>
trying to leak
<Sync time="38.280"/>
private parts of
<Sync time="39.030"/>
people's identity , you see people
<Sync time="40.810"/>
bullying people online .
<Sync time="42.580"/>
you see people making threats against people's safety ,
<Sync time="45.250"/>
their family and their own safety online ,
<Sync time="48.320"/>
um and these kinds of things are incredibly bad .
<Sync time="50.395"/>
and
<Sync time="51.430"/>
the idea ,
<Sync time="52.760"/>
like , the main idea for why censorship is bad
<Sync time="55.180"/>
is because you don't want to suppress discourse .
<Sync time="57.635"/>
but obviously bullying and harassment ,
<Sync time="60.120"/>
besides just being
<Sync time="60.740"/>
affront to individual people's dignity ,
<Sync time="63.320"/>
is also going to suppress discourse
<Sync time="65.810"/>
because , like, if i'm afraid of
<Sync time="68.120"/>
if i'm afraid of like a bunch of trump trolls ,
<Sync time="70.710"/>
like um
<Sync time="71.420"/>
doing very bad things ,
<Sync time="73.580"/>
threatening me , leaking my identity ,
<Sync time="75.590"/>
i'm not going to express my views on the internet ,
<Sync time="77.980"/>
um critiquing them on twitter if i'm worried
<Sync time="80.090"/>
that it's going to set off like
<Sync time="81.415"/>
uh like a whole like a whole big thing .
<Sync time="84.050"/>
so i think that in a lot of ways this leads to
<Sync time="86.850"/>
it can lead to great harms to
<Sync time="88.360"/>
people ,
<Sync time="89.065"/>
but it also can suppress discourse anyway , if
<Sync time="91.600"/>
you just suppress discourse in the right way .
<Sync time="93.900"/>
and i think that this is also true with respect to
<Sync time="96.800"/>
possibly getting dangerous ideologies out .
<Sync time="99.495"/>
and this is important because the internet's a useful platform in giving a lot of unsavory individuals a community to coalesce around .
<Sync time="106.675"/>
you can have places like um
<Sync time="108.800"/>
like four chan , uh
<Sync time="110.775"/>
have like a lot of unsavory elements to it .
<Sync time="113.570"/>
um i hear there's five chan nowadays , which is for the people who i guess weren't
<Sync time="118.840"/>

<Sync time="119.550"/>
who didn't like four chan enough . they wanted something even less savory .
<Sync time="123.090"/>
there's um
<Sync time="124.735"/>
whole lots of internet forums like that , or more commonly
<Sync time="127.900"/>
i guess is reddit , um
<Sync time="129.550"/>
where people uh
<Sync time="130.820"/>
post all kinds of things , all kinds of content , and
<Sync time="133.290"/>
it's essentially a breeding ground for
<Sync time="135.355"/>
a lot of things , like alt-right ,
<Sync time="137.100"/>
white supremacy groups ,
<Sync time="138.530"/>
um other kinds of things like that
<Sync time="140.230"/>
um which are
<Sync time="141.370"/>
uh oftentimes used to target uh vulnerable people in society
<Sync time="145.830"/>
uh in really bad ways .
<Sync time="147.055"/>
and i think that censoring the internet is important to actually suppressing these kinds of things .
<Sync time="151.090"/>
um so the final thing they i would therefore talk about is why i think that censorship is going to happen in the correct way .
<Sync time="157.705"/>
and i think that the reason why it would happen in the correct
<Sync time="160.170"/>
way is because right now we have
<Sync time="162.245"/>
uh a great default to uh other than in the most extreme of extreme cases ,
<Sync time="167.780"/>
um just about anything on the internet goes . and
<Sync time="170.595"/>
even if something on the internet is bad per se ,
<Sync time="173.750"/>
since it's so difficult to regulate it ,
<Sync time="176.150"/>
since we don't put a lot of resources into
<Sync time="178.470"/>
uh some kinds of
<Sync time="179.410"/>
internet monitoring ,
<Sync time="180.685"/>
um
<Sync time="181.460"/>
for uh things other than like terrorism and like uh
<Sync time="184.780"/>
crimes i guess ,
<Sync time="185.890"/>
but we don't look at so much as uh regulating it as a modicum of discourse .
<Sync time="190.050"/>
that's like a big problem because a whole lot of our discourse as a society happens on the internet nowadays
<Sync time="195.380"/>
and when we don't regulate it the right way ,
<Sync time="197.945"/>
i think that what it results in a lot of these unsavory elements bubbling up .
<Sync time="201.855"/>
and the big thing is that i feel like
<Sync time="204.520"/>
um there's a natural check against this in that
<Sync time="207.030"/>
um if you try to check reasonable people or if you try to
<Sync time="210.360"/>
uh check people who have more like reasonable political views ,
<Sync time="213.960"/>
there would be a whole lot of
<Sync time="215.060"/>
backlash on that .
<Sync time="216.150"/>
most places have legal protection on those kinds of things .
<Sync time="218.735"/>
uh i really don't see this being
<Sync time="221.030"/>
all that successful unless you're talking about people who are
<Sync time="224.170"/>
truly abusing
<Sync time="225.555"/>
their position or using it to hurt other people and silence oth-
<Sync time="228.990"/>
silence other people .
<Sync time="230.085"/>
so for those reasons ,
<Sync time="231.550"/>
increase internet censorship .
<Sync time="234.119"/>
