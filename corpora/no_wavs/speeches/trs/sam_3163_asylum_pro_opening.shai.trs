at a fundamental level
<Sync time="2.250"/>
the right of asylum is the right to impose .
<Sync time="5.770"/>
although we regret
<Sync time="7.095"/>
any repression that individuals face as a result of their government
<Sync time="11.660"/>
or institutions which are powerful within their state ,
<Sync time="15.920"/>
we believe that governments have no obligation
<Sync time="19.175"/>
to actually provide individuals asylum .
<Sync time="22.635"/>
as such ,
<Sync time="23.890"/>
we should limit the right to asylum in all western liberal democracies .
<Sync time="28.885"/>

<Sync time="29.495"/>
our model is simple :
<Sync time="31.560"/>
we believe that western liberal democracies should not allow criminals into the state .
<Sync time="36.870"/>
this does not include political crimes , because
<Sync time="39.410"/>
anyone who is running from their state
<Sync time="42.110"/>
will likely be uh guilty of that , 
<Sync time="44.720"/>
but includes violent crimes or even low
<Sync time="47.520"/>
misdemeanors . we believe governments should retain the right to refuse these individuals .
<Sync time="52.790"/>
additionally ,
<Sync time="53.620"/>
we believe that asylum seekers should only be brought into the state
<Sync time="57.650"/>
if they add to the economy or society
<Sync time="60.265"/>
in some meaningful way .
<Sync time="62.990"/>
if a job is already massively overly saturated ,
<Sync time="66.360"/>
immigrants should not be brought in , even if they uh have been persecuted by their state .
<Sync time="70.910"/>
we have two arguments to support this motion :
<Sync time="74.630"/>
first , on the obligations of government .
<Sync time="77.490"/>
the obligations of government
<Sync time="79.185"/>
are first and foremost to the people within the state .
<Sync time="82.940"/>
their legitimacy
<Sync time="84.580"/>
is derived from the people
<Sync time="86.250"/>
because the ancestors of these citizens ,
<Sync time="89.100"/>
either
<Sync time="89.960"/>
created the state or allowed other individuals into the state
<Sync time="93.860"/>
who've been deemed appropriate .
<Sync time="96.840"/>
fundamentally all moral legitimacy ,
<Sync time="99.500"/>
any legitimacy which would give the states the power to use violence to do taxation ,
<Sync time="103.885"/>
or to create a military ,
<Sync time="105.370"/>
is derived from the people within that state and not foreign powers .
<Sync time="109.840"/>
additionally , the power of the state
<Sync time="111.970"/>
is derived from the people .
<Sync time="113.910"/>
the pa-
<Sync time="115.255"/>
the state speaks
<Sync time="116.815"/>
in terms of money
<Sync time="118.155"/>
and in terms of military force .
<Sync time="120.680"/>
both of these are derived from the people 
<Sync time="122.565"/>
in the form of taxation 
<Sync time="124.075"/>
and the ability to create and control
<Sync time="126.530"/>
a militar- military .
<Sync time="128.600"/>
as such , a government has no obligations outside of
<Sync time="132.750"/>
uh the people within the state .
<Sync time="135.590"/>
it is incredibly important to
<Sync time="137.100"/>
have this sort of vetting , to ensure the prosperity of the people within the state as well .
<Sync time="142.270"/>
recognize that criminals have high recidivism rates , particularly when they commit violent crimes ,
<Sync time="147.155"/>
and individuals who do not have
<Sync time="148.795"/>
a job or can't get a job , because
<Sync time="151.075"/>
an over saturation the market occurs ,
<Sync time="153.200"/>
are far more likely to turn to crime .
<Sync time="155.690"/>

<Sync time="156.880"/>
additionally ,
<Sync time="157.810"/>
when individuals take jobs from other uh
<Sync time="160.355"/>
individuals
<Sync time="161.440"/>
in a certain western liberal democracy ,
<Sync time="164.000"/>
they're a lot more likely to push those people into crime , and harm the families and communities
<Sync time="168.270"/>
which c- uh create and control the state .
<Sync time="171.030"/>
as such
<Sync time="172.140"/>
governments have to vet the individuals who come in
<Sync time="175.800"/>
through asylum , and must limit
<Sync time="177.655"/>
that right .
<Sync time="179.470"/>
the second independent argument
<Sync time="181.460"/>
is that there are people who have waited , or are otherwise more deserving .
<Sync time="186.020"/>
recognize that in most western liberal democracies
<Sync time="189.160"/>
there's a huge waiting list for immigrants who have applied to get into the state and have simply waited .
<Sync time="194.365"/>
let us evaluate the desert claims between these two groups .
<Sync time="198.710"/>
first , th-
<Sync time="199.710"/>
on political persecution
<Sync time="201.000"/>
verses immigrant harms .
<Sync time="203.180"/>
if you take the united states as an example ,
<Sync time="205.330"/>
a huge number of immigrants from mexico and south america
<Sync time="209.370"/>
are running from
<Sync time="210.310"/>
dire 
<Sync time="210.920"/>
uh situations of poverty ,
<Sync time="212.515"/>
or running from similar persecution , but have not been recognized by the united states .
<Sync time="217.040"/>
things like cartel violence is far less likely to get you
<Sync time="219.970"/>
the right to asylum
<Sync time="221.010"/>
than violence from the state .
<Sync time="223.010"/>
so in the vast majority of situations
<Sync time="225.120"/>
these people have just as many claims to come into a western liberal democracy
<Sync time="229.600"/>
as individuals uh who want the
<Sync time="231.835"/>
the right to asylum .
<Sync time="233.620"/>

<Sync time="234.760"/>
however , the individuals on the like waiting list
<Sync time="237.790"/>
have waited a huge amount of time , they've spent
<Sync time="240.480"/>
they've got the system legally
<Sync time="242.135"/>
and have otherwise respected the rules and regulations of the people 
<Sync time="246.280"/>
and as such have a greater desert claim to come into the state .
<Sync time="249.850"/>
we would further say that no individual who seeks asylum has a right to a particular state
<Sync time="255.600"/>
and given the variety of states who
<Sync time="257.550"/>
will accept individuals ,
<Sync time="258.985"/>
and even the non western liberal democracies which will except individuals ,
<Sync time="263.020"/>
they have no ,
<Sync time="264.405"/>
that the right to asylum can be limited legitimately
<Sync time="267.475"/>
to protect the people within a particular state .
<Sync time="270.170"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="272.459"/>
