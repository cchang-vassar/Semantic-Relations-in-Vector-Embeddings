i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion
<Sync time="2.640"/>
that schools should teach only abstinence-only sex education .
<Sync time="8.310"/>
three independent points .
<Sync time="9.755"/>
first is that this is the only effective method of birth control .
<Sync time="14.570"/>
um when you're talking about really any method of birth control you know uh
<Sync time="18.120"/>
the pill , when your're talking about i_u_d's
<Sync time="20.460"/>
uh barrier methods like condoms
<Sync time="22.350"/>
there's a fail rate
<Sync time="23.310"/>
intrinsic to all of these .
<Sync time="24.840"/>
part of that is improper usage
<Sync time="27.150"/>
um because you know
<Sync time="28.590"/>
children are just bad at using things because they're children
<Sync time="31.620"/>
but also because um the %hes
<Sync time="34.810"/>
intrinsically to the the nature of the product itself it just fails sometimes . um
<Sync time="39.195"/>
there are hormonal reasons when you're talking about hormonal birth control
<Sync time="42.570"/>
and then also with barrier methods
<Sync time="44.810"/>
um you know when you're mass producing something in a factory there are just certain things that are faulty
<Sync time="50.410"/>
um you know condoms break things like that .
<Sync time="52.885"/>
so at that point then
<Sync time="55.100"/>
it becomes important to educate children properly ,
<Sync time="58.470"/>
to tell them
<Sync time="59.225"/>
this is the only way you will be able to ensure that you're not going to you know get pregnant or get an s_t_d is to
<Sync time="66.630"/>
have sex in a manner or
<Sync time="68.000"/>
just did not have sex rather
<Sync time="69.660"/>
um
<Sync time="70.375"/>
because that's all you can really do to have one hundred percent certainty .
<Sync time="74.540"/>
our second independent point is that
<Sync time="76.905"/>
children really just shouldn't be having sex yet .
<Sync time="80.275"/>
i think it's important to recognize
<Sync time="82.375"/>
that um at this age children are poorly informed at best and i don't think sexual education is really going to mitigate that .
<Sync time="90.430"/>
um i'll get more into the flaws of the the process itself in a bit but
<Sync time="94.385"/>
it's important that %hes
<Sync time="95.670"/>
at such a young age
<Sync time="98.300"/>
you're not going to have uh you know meaningful consent because meaningful consent is predicated on
<Sync time="103.750"/>
the capacity of the participating parties
<Sync time="107.065"/>
to have some sort of uh
<Sync time="109.400"/>
like
<Sync time="110.030"/>
reasonable , well rounded understanding
<Sync time="112.800"/>
of what they're getting into .
<Sync time="114.770"/>
um
<Sync time="115.440"/>
and specifically with sex ,which can have
<Sync time="117.805"/>
incredible consequences on uh children for a long time when you're talking about you know pregnancy or s_t_d's ,
<Sync time="124.310"/>
this is something that they're just not ready for yet at this age .
<Sync time="127.580"/>
so it's not reasonable then for
<Sync time="129.320"/>
schools to teach them um
<Sync time="131.005"/>
you know here are the tools to go out and do this thing that
<Sync time="133.845"/>
you shouldn't be doing
<Sync time="135.150"/>
no matter what .
<Sync time="136.985"/>
the third independent point that i'd like to put forward is that just broadly speaking
<Sync time="141.410"/>
even the the concept of sex education that is um
<Sync time="144.675"/>
you know teaching children
<Sync time="146.230"/>
safe-sex practices
<Sync time="147.850"/>
is inappropriate for teachers to discuss .
<Sync time="150.410"/>
um i think
<Sync time="151.470"/>
generally speaking this is something that
<Sync time="154.405"/>
you know maybe parents can make an individual decision on whether or not they want their children to
<Sync time="159.100"/>
learn about these things
<Sync time="160.780"/>
but
<Sync time="161.190"/>
this isn't something that should go on in a public school because there are legitimate reasons for parents to
<Sync time="166.700"/>
not want their children to you know be exposed to this discussion at such a young age .
<Sync time="172.280"/>
um
<Sync time="173.025"/>
%hes different children develop at different rates ,
<Sync time="175.870"/>
uh different parents have different parenting styles .
<Sync time="178.370"/>
so there's perfectly legitimate reasons
<Sync time="180.930"/>
to say that
<Sync time="182.410"/>
this just isn't something that an individual parent wants their children to be exposed to .
<Sync time="187.590"/>
at that point ,
<Sync time="188.610"/>
it's inappropriate for a public school system to
<Sync time="191.500"/>
broadly have this conversation with every single student that's int it
<Sync time="195.645"/>
because that does essentially endorse the position
<Sync time="198.990"/>
um that this is something that we should universally expose children to .
<Sync time="203.105"/>
at the point where there's reasonable deviation from that standard
<Sync time="206.480"/>
um and where this is particularly sensitive information that parents would have a legitimate reason for
<Sync time="211.720"/>
fully blocking children from even being exposed to ,
<Sync time="215.530"/>
it's reasonable to say that we should only teach abstinence
<Sync time="218.840"/>
and that any
<Sync time="219.610"/>
other additional information can simply be provided by parents
<Sync time="223.460"/>
who would like to have that conversation with their children . proud to propose .
<Sync time="228.310"/>
