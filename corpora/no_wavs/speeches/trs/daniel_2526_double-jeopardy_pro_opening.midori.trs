we should abolish the jeopar-
<Sync time="2.620"/>
double jeopardy defense because it is
<Sync time="5.510"/>
affirmatively justified to ultimately achieve the purposes of justice ,
<Sync time="9.735"/>
and secondarily ,
<Sync time="11.365"/>
um
<Sync time="12.210"/>
double jeopardy is unnecessary because
<Sync time="14.870"/>
abuses of it will be self regulating in nature 
<Sync time="18.270"/>
given practical constraints .
<Sync time="20.140"/>
so let's start by talking about why double jeopardy is affirmatively justified .
<Sync time="24.500"/>
so keep in mind that
<Sync time="26.775"/>
the likely reason somebody is going to be having this debate and discussion in the first place
<Sync time="31.960"/>
of trying somebody for a crime that they were already not convicted of ,
<Sync time="35.390"/>
is because they probably have to have some reason to do so .
<Sync time="38.430"/>
we would posit that the likely reason for this is because some kind of new evidence comes up
<Sync time="43.210"/>
that would
<Sync time="43.825"/>
possibly lead to an actual substantive change in the outcome of the case itself .
<Sync time="48.640"/>
so this new evidence can come in the form of say like maybe like more modern day d_n_a evidence ,
<Sync time="54.110"/>
it could come in the form of a confession ,
<Sync time="57.575"/>
or come in the form of like new witnesses that
<Sync time="60.605"/>
maybe were too afraid to testify beforehand .
<Sync time="63.465"/>
there is any number of circumstances that are
<Sync time="66.230"/>
fairly plausible
<Sync time="67.830"/>
under which
<Sync time="68.795"/>
um there might be different evidence that could that was concealed before the trial
<Sync time="72.880"/>
that could substantively change an
<Sync time="74.270"/>
outcome .
<Sync time="74.970"/>
and
<Sync time="75.785"/>
this is particularly true given that in a lot of places like america , there is a right to a speedy trial . especially when it's a criminal trial .
<Sync time="84.440"/>
um
<Sync time="85.090"/>
oftentimes there's not a very wide time window for a lot of evidence to come out
<Sync time="89.300"/>
or it could just be something that came from long time ago
<Sync time="92.100"/>
where some of the evidence
<Sync time="93.410"/>
may not have existed because of contemporary technology .
<Sync time="95.910"/>

<Sync time="97.060"/>
so this is important because it
<Sync time="99.040"/>
under any one of those cases it's possible the outcome of the
<Sync time="101.830"/>
court can change . and this is key .
<Sync time="103.805"/>
because i don't think that guilt or innocence is merely something that is proven or not proven by a process .
<Sync time="110.700"/>
that is to say
<Sync time="112.005"/>
if you actually committed a crime in reality ,
<Sync time="115.120"/>
just because you were found not guilty of it
<Sync time="117.400"/>
doesn't mean that you didn't
<Sync time="118.760"/>
are any less guilty of the crime , if you did in reality do it , because whether or not you committed the crime
<Sync time="124.135"/>
is uh
<Sync time="124.830"/>
is factual in nature . not nearly procedural in nature .
<Sync time="128.360"/>
so this is important because i think that the criminal justice system should ,
<Sync time="131.605"/>
at its best , 
<Sync time="132.710"/>
try to make sure that it is striving for truth and that it is striving to make sure that it's actually able to punish
<Sync time="138.505"/>
people
<Sync time="139.150"/>
who have committed crimes and wrongs .
<Sync time="141.880"/>
keep in mind that
<Sync time="143.040"/>
if these people , if there's more evidence that somebody committed the crime , maybe they %hes
<Sync time="147.010"/>
there was like a confession
<Sync time="147.660"/>
or d_n_a evidence ,
<Sync time="149.260"/>
and they're now walking away scot-free from that crime ,
<Sync time="152.850"/>
this is someone who deserves to be punished ,
<Sync time="154.760"/>
who isn't being punished .
<Sync time="156.160"/>
this is someone who in which case victims have been wronged and victims aren't being compensated .
<Sync time="161.130"/>
this is somebody who may be a threat to society at large
<Sync time="164.080"/>
and society isn't being protected from this person .
<Sync time="166.860"/>
there's a lot of reasons why
<Sync time="169.085"/>
if somebody has is guilty and is a criminal they need to make sure that they're
<Sync time="173.160"/>
justice is administered to them .
<Sync time="174.980"/>
so 
<Sync time="175.830"/>
finally let's talk about why i think that at the end the day this is self regulating and isn't actually going to be abused all that much .
<Sync time="183.005"/>

<Sync time="183.620"/>
keep in mind that it costs a whole lot of money to put on trials . whether
<Sync time="187.615"/>
uh if you're a
<Sync time="188.605"/>
if you're like a state , you don't want to just like
<Sync time="191.400"/>
this is why a lot of trials are settled with plea agreements or settlements or things like that .
<Sync time="196.420"/>
people don't want to go to trial because going to trial is risky , it's expensive and it's %hes
<Sync time="200.660"/>
a arduous process .
<Sync time="202.085"/>
so i think that when you're giving somebody the option of trying someone again
<Sync time="206.545"/>
for a crime they were already not found they were found um not guilty of 
<Sync time="211.000"/>
it's likely that most rational people will look at this as a waste of money .
<Sync time="215.610"/>
so they're probably not just going to do this to harass people as a way to keep people in jail indefinitely or try to indefinitely detain somebody
<Sync time="222.990"/>
without actually proving charges against them .
<Sync time="225.700"/>
i would first and foremost
<Sync time="227.255"/>
likely say that if these abuses were occurring , they would be found unconstitutional and therefore
<Sync time="232.870"/>
they would get kicked out .
<Sync time="234.125"/>
but i also think that this is just an unlikely thing actually happen in reality .
<Sync time="238.150"/>
so what you're left with
<Sync time="239.415"/>
is double jeopardy only being used when there's actually a substantively likely change in the outcome of the case one way or another .
<Sync time="246.660"/>
so
<Sync time="247.460"/>
for those reasons very proud to propose .
<Sync time="251.059"/>
