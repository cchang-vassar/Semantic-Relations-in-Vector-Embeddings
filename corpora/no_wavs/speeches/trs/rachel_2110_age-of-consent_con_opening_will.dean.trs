will cannot have it both ways .
<Sync time="3.580"/>
he has to choose
<Sync time="4.850"/>
are these laws
<Sync time="5.880"/>
rarely enforced
<Sync time="7.060"/>
and thus do not matter
<Sync time="8.730"/>
or do we live in a dictatorship in which every sixteen year old who has sex is dragged into court .
<Sync time="15.570"/>
we think that it is somewhere in between .
<Sync time="17.820"/>
we don't think that anyone is getting deprived of their sexual liberation .
<Sync time="21.720"/>
will rightfully points out that the majority of the time
<Sync time="24.880"/>
these laws aren't enforced .
<Sync time="26.770"/>
it's really rare that the eighteen year old is sued by the sixteen year old because they're both in the same high school class .
<Sync time="33.085"/>

<Sync time="33.800"/>
rather we think that we need these laws in place
<Sync time="36.260"/>
for those edge cases
<Sync time="37.665"/>
for when people need to press charges or when someone is being truly abused .
<Sync time="42.480"/>
these systems are checks in a world where we hope we never have to use them .
<Sync time="46.875"/>
more than this ,
<Sync time="48.130"/>
we don't think that we have to do this in the dumb way .
<Sync time="50.750"/>
op
<Sync time="51.310"/>
is open to adjustments in laws ,
<Sync time="53.560"/>
not persecuting people who are within two years of each other
<Sync time="56.660"/>
or other similar kinds of adjustments .
<Sync time="59.085"/>
the only thing that we're
<Sync time="60.215"/>
truly defending is a strict age of consent
<Sync time="63.190"/>
at eighteen year olds
<Sync time="64.680"/>
eighteen years old .
<Sync time="66.300"/>
two main areas of clash .
<Sync time="67.695"/>
the first on the promotion of sexualization of youth by these kinds of laws .
<Sync time="72.210"/>
when you remove illegality
<Sync time="73.820"/>
you create a market .
<Sync time="75.305"/>
already one of the largest porn searches
<Sync time="77.865"/>
are teen and amateur .
<Sync time="79.765"/>
now you can have
<Sync time="80.980"/>
actual teens on that screen .
<Sync time="83.270"/>
recognize the only thing stopping industries such as porn
<Sync time="86.760"/>
or
<Sync time="87.205"/>
other like sexually objectifying t_v shows
<Sync time="90.110"/>
from using very young children
<Sync time="91.940"/>
is that it's illegal to do so .
<Sync time="94.060"/>
we think at the point that you remove that boundary
<Sync time="96.660"/>
you're going to have these people
<Sync time="98.990"/>
increasingly sexualized and
<Sync time="100.590"/>
younger and younger people because this is
<Sync time="103.015"/>
already the trend that we're moving toward .
<Sync time="105.485"/>
sure i gave you one more extreme example
<Sync time="108.555"/>
but we also think that there's going to be a general increase in more suggestive media
<Sync time="112.570"/>
with youth
<Sync time="113.590"/>
as you see
<Sync time="114.280"/>
less and less stigmatization
<Sync time="115.995"/>
of young sex .
<Sync time="117.660"/>
this means more and more
<Sync time="119.240"/>
immersion in sex before you are
<Sync time="121.520"/>
old enough to even conceptualize it , what it might mean .
<Sync time="124.500"/>

<Sync time="125.170"/>
government is right .
<Sync time="126.060"/>
you can't remove all the influences
<Sync time="128.120"/>
but you can definitely not
<Sync time="129.800"/>
add to that fire
<Sync time="130.930"/>
by removing the age of consent .
<Sync time="132.910"/>
society has gone far enough
<Sync time="134.900"/>
with sexualizing young women .
<Sync time="136.880"/>
we tell you no more .
<Sync time="138.920"/>
our second area of clash
<Sync time="140.420"/>
has to do with the protection of minors
<Sync time="142.650"/>
because even if they might understand the physical mechanism of sex ,
<Sync time="146.330"/>
we don't think they usually understand the intimate , emotional details .
<Sync time="150.380"/>
will is right ,
<Sync time="151.730"/>
there is a power disbalance between ages
<Sync time="154.220"/>
but that isn't created by the age of consent
<Sync time="156.840"/>
rather
<Sync time="157.520"/>
that existed before hand
<Sync time="159.155"/>
and the age of consent is created to protect against it .
<Sync time="162.295"/>
older men and women will always be more experienced and be able to leverage emotional power
<Sync time="168.000"/>
against the younger people they are sleeping with .
<Sync time="170.320"/>
combine this oftentimes with financial power
<Sync time="172.995"/>
and you end up in the kind of power disbalance relationships that we're talking about .
<Sync time="177.190"/>
it's just true that there is something wrong with the twenty eight year old who's dating sixteen year old
<Sync time="182.475"/>
and that sixteen year old
<Sync time="183.840"/>
probably needs to be protected from them .
<Sync time="186.770"/>
we think that you need to have that legal catch hole
<Sync time="189.270"/>
for when there is a problem and when someone does want to press charges
<Sync time="193.210"/>
because the alternative
<Sync time="194.495"/>
is a world in which regardless of how much abuse you're going through ,
<Sync time="197.940"/>
you cannot prove it
<Sync time="199.235"/>
because this is just part of being in a relationship .
<Sync time="202.010"/>
we need to offer special protections ,
<Sync time="203.970"/>
specifically to minors ,
<Sync time="205.440"/>
because they are much more likely to be exploited .
<Sync time="207.880"/>
not only do they often
<Sync time="209.220"/>
not know what a healthy relationship looks like ,
<Sync time="211.895"/>
but they are often taught by the media
<Sync time="213.825"/>
that the way in which they can
<Sync time="215.120"/>
gain love or acceptance
<Sync time="216.770"/>
is by offering themselves up
<Sync time="218.600"/>
sexually .
<Sync time="219.920"/>
and we think that at some point
<Sync time="222.130"/>
these people need to be protected from themselves
<Sync time="224.605"/>
and from the media
<Sync time="225.670"/>
they consume their entire lives .
<Sync time="228.300"/>
as such
<Sync time="229.090"/>
the age of consent is fine .
<Sync time="230.990"/>
the only thing that needs changing is people's mindsets
<Sync time="234.095"/>
and how we view it .
<Sync time="235.430"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="238.360"/>
