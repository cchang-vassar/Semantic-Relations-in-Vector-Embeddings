so
<Sync time="1.000"/>
side governments
<Sync time="2.350"/>
case in this debate
<Sync time="3.740"/>
basically says the following thing ,
<Sync time="6.220"/>
there are no clear advantages to
<Sync time="9.185"/>
the cloning of specifically human beings that we cannot achieve by clomi-
<Sync time="14.990"/>
cloning
<Sync time="15.680"/>
human organs or cloning animals or bringing
<Sync time="18.685"/>
babies to the world .
<Sync time="20.345"/>
but
<Sync time="21.035"/>
there are a few potential ethical {problem/problems} that might arise
<Sync time="25.770"/>
with regard to how society treats
<Sync time="28.395"/>
the
<Sync time="29.145"/>
cloned people .
<Sync time="30.835"/>
we are going to win this case
<Sync time="33.280"/>
by
<Sync time="33.935"/>
first pointing to some great advantages in specifically human cloning ,
<Sync time="38.890"/>
and secondly by showing you why all of the concerns that were brought up by side government
<Sync time="44.855"/>
are technical and
<Sync time="46.100"/>
solvable
<Sync time="47.120"/>
and not inherent .
<Sync time="48.650"/>
but before that we think that we need to discuss
<Sync time="51.705"/>
the mental state
<Sync time="53.570"/>
uh or the mental situation
<Sync time="55.890"/>
of these clones , because this can help bring a little bit
<Sync time="58.970"/>
order to this discussion and make it a little less blurry .
<Sync time="62.285"/>
i think that we need to ask whether
<Sync time="64.460"/>
my clone also
<Sync time="66.350"/>
includes all of my personal traits and my memories
<Sync time="70.510"/>
or is it like a
<Sync time="72.260"/>
totally new born baby that comes to the world
<Sync time="75.260"/>
tabula rasa .
<Sync time="76.685"/>
the other side chose not to address this question but i think that it is implied from their logic
<Sync time="83.290"/>
that we are talking about the former .
<Sync time="85.520"/>
that
<Sync time="86.460"/>
a clone
<Sync time="87.750"/>
like we're talking about clones that are
<Sync time="89.470"/>
that are created as exact replicas
<Sync time="91.930"/>
of the person
<Sync time="93.160"/>
there they were cloned from .
<Sync time="94.915"/>
and this includes
<Sync time="96.670"/>
also mental state and whatever stems from this .
<Sync time="100.040"/>
because you know they talk to us about
<Sync time="102.300"/>
the clones being human agents and about property claims to the
<Sync time="106.385"/>
like of the original person .
<Sync time="108.170"/>
so
<Sync time="108.825"/>
from now on we are simply going to assume that this is the situation we're going to
<Sync time="112.680"/>
go with that .
<Sync time="114.350"/>
okay so
<Sync time="115.220"/>
side government
<Sync time="116.655"/>
don't see any
<Sync time="118.640"/>
advantages to cloning . here are some meaningful ones :
<Sync time="122.060"/>
a ,
<Sync time="122.815"/>
if god forbid , i lost my kid or my partner in a car accident or something ,
<Sync time="128.600"/>
cloning might help me bring him back to life .
<Sync time="132.060"/>
that's right , i'm talking about
<Sync time="133.660"/>
overcoming death . 
<Sync time="134.980"/>
if this is not a meaningful benefit , i truly don't know what is .
<Sync time="138.970"/>
b , it is
<Sync time="140.815"/>
possible to clone great thinkers . now think about
<Sync time="145.025"/>
how much could be achieved if there were
<Sync time="147.905"/>
two or three more
<Sync time="149.060"/>
einstein's that could join forces in research of the universe .
<Sync time="153.070"/>
now there's a lot more to say , but i think that we'll settle for these two advantages for now . and note
<Sync time="158.740"/>
that these are advantages that could in no way be achieved by simply cloning sheep 
<Sync time="163.845"/>
and are unique to human cloning .
<Sync time="166.550"/>
oh but what about the ethical problems that tim talks about ? well
<Sync time="170.740"/>
let's see .
<Sync time="171.645"/>

<Sync time="172.470"/>
first he talks to us about there being property rights issues to the clone .
<Sync time="177.215"/>
this is a very weird point . this will be a person , not a property .
<Sync time="182.020"/>
no one has property rights to it .
<Sync time="185.620"/>
like , problem solved .
<Sync time="187.230"/>
next he talks about
<Sync time="189.060"/>
clone-
<Sync time="190.050"/>
cloned organ reaping farms or something .
<Sync time="192.860"/>
now never mind the fact that a minute before that ,
<Sync time="195.975"/>
he tells us himself that we are already developing technologies for cloning
<Sync time="200.365"/>
organs
<Sync time="201.240"/>
that are going to solve this shortage problem
<Sync time="203.760"/>
therefore there's no sense in such farms .
<Sync time="206.505"/>
but
<Sync time="207.490"/>
hey here's an idea ,
<Sync time="209.300"/>
let's outlaw such farms 
<Sync time="211.080"/>
if they
<Sync time="211.970"/>
do if they will exist .
<Sync time="214.460"/>
human cloning will probably be easy enough to supervise . it's expensive as team says , it's not something
<Sync time="220.870"/>
that you could simply do with great ease and speed at some back alley ,
<Sync time="225.135"/>
so it will be pretty easy for us to make sure that this doesn't happen .
<Sync time="228.750"/>
problem solved .
<Sync time="229.805"/>
and then
<Sync time="230.730"/>
tim tells us that society is going to treat these clones with great cruelty .
<Sync time="235.340"/>
now 
<Sync time="235.740"/>
perhaps that's true , society is in fact
<Sync time="238.730"/>
not very patient
<Sync time="240.180"/>
towards whoever is considered different .
<Sync time="242.540"/>
but
<Sync time="243.260"/>
it's
<Sync time="243.820"/>
it's no different from problems of prejudice and discrimination that minority populations
<Sync time="249.140"/>
have to deal with
<Sync time="250.545"/>
every day .
<Sync time="251.775"/>
this is simply a matter that takes some time and an adjustment period
<Sync time="256.990"/>
and and eventually
<Sync time="258.325"/>
this will be solved as well .
<Sync time="260.250"/>
it might take a few generations for sure , but that by itself is not a good enough reason to
<Sync time="265.290"/>
curtail the scientific
<Sync time="267.580"/>
progress and to
<Sync time="268.890"/>
prevent all of the great advantages of human cloning .
<Sync time="272.050"/>
please oppose the motion .
<Sync time="273.715"/>
