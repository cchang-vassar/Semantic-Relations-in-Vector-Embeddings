we should ban human cloning .
<Sync time="2.890"/>
so we think it's simply the case that there are a massive amount of risks that come with allowing human cloning
<Sync time="8.950"/>
that come with allowing people
<Sync time="10.590"/>
to clone themselves or for corporations to clone other people
<Sync time="14.140"/>
with very little gains that can
<Sync time="16.985"/>
come from this . recognize that the
<Sync time="18.575"/>
process of cloning can still be tested
<Sync time="20.735"/>
under this model
<Sync time="22.030"/>
through
<Sync time="22.790"/>
uh other animals , that you can still produce organs in a number of ways . in fact ,
<Sync time="27.080"/>
organ production , human organ production is already being done
<Sync time="30.140"/>
in a number of different ways through a number of different methods
<Sync time="32.970"/>
that don't involve human cloning .
<Sync time="34.720"/>
we simply think that is the case
<Sync time="36.220"/>
that there's no real game . so why do we think that's the case ?
<Sync time="39.460"/>
if you create human agents
<Sync time="41.330"/>
you should treat that human agent
<Sync time="43.270"/>
as such . what that means is that if you were to create a clone
<Sync time="46.660"/>
than that
<Sync time="47.240"/>
clone should be
<Sync time="48.260"/>
given the full rights of any other human agent
<Sync time="51.050"/>
simply by the nature of their humanity .
<Sync time="53.740"/>
just because they are
<Sync time="54.980"/>
a s- the same genetic makeup of another human being
<Sync time="58.420"/>
doesn't mean that
<Sync time="59.275"/>
they can't internalize the harms that will be placed upon them such as that other human being . it doesn't mean
<Sync time="63.850"/>
that they don't have the right to their own autonomy , their own agency .
<Sync time="67.580"/>
it doesn't mean that because they're derived from a method other than natural birth
<Sync time="71.610"/>
that they aren't still a human and deserve the rights
<Sync time="73.995"/>
that come with that .
<Sync time="75.230"/>
what this means is that
<Sync time="76.670"/>
any if you were to create a human clone
<Sync time="79.395"/>
that human should be created
<Sync time="81.055"/>
as a new free individual
<Sync time="83.570"/>
but this is an incredibly costly process and given that the outcome of that costly process would be essentially the same outcome
<Sync time="90.065"/>
of giving birth
<Sync time="91.420"/>
we simply don't see any
<Sync time="92.710"/>
massive benefit to doing this . maybe there are scientific advancements you can gain
<Sync time="96.710"/>
but we don't see what scientific advancements you gain particular specifically through human cloning
<Sync time="101.410"/>
that you wouldn't be able to gain through
<Sync time="103.005"/>
learning about how cloning works
<Sync time="104.800"/>
in other organisms and other animals . there's nothing about human biology that is so unique
<Sync time="109.325"/>
that we couldn't
<Sync time="110.270"/>
learn or get scientific breakthroughs
<Sync time="112.400"/>
through other methods of cloning but what you do get
<Sync time="115.020"/>
is you don't create a new human agent
<Sync time="117.715"/>
when you do cloning
<Sync time="118.895"/>
through other species . we think other scientific knowledge
<Sync time="121.690"/>
cu-
<Sync time="122.160"/>
knowledge can be gained from cloning animals
<Sync time="124.135"/>
but we simply don't think
<Sync time="125.310"/>
the massive cost of cloning a human is worth the outcome
<Sync time="128.515"/>
of creating a new
<Sync time="129.720"/>
agent
<Sync time="130.190"/>
but what we do think is likely to be the case is that if you were to put this cost in
<Sync time="134.140"/>
people would have
<Sync time="135.070"/>
some uh some sort of expectation of that cloned person . we think there are a number of ethical qualms
<Sync time="140.710"/>
that come with cloning . the first is a property right to a clone .
<Sync time="144.325"/>
the question of who has property to a cloned individual
<Sync time="148.025"/>
is something that we think is likely to arise
<Sync time="150.365"/>
and
<Sync time="150.750"/>
uh along with identity problems that come with that clone . the identity problems
<Sync time="154.870"/>
of the original person
<Sync time="156.370"/>
uh and of his clone knowing who they are and being able to relate to the world . we think that that kind of
<Sync time="161.295"/>
psychological burden is unfair , not to mention the fact that there is now a property claim
<Sync time="165.690"/>
being contested between
<Sync time="167.205"/>
the original individual who has been cloned and probably the corporation or the lab
<Sync time="171.540"/>
that was to clone them .
<Sync time="172.800"/>
we think there's a potential for organ farms which we think
<Sync time="175.640"/>
is incredibly problematic because
<Sync time="177.680"/>
if you were to create this high cost business of cloning human beings ,
<Sync time="181.050"/>
we think it's likely that you'd want some sort of economic return on that and we can
<Sync time="184.610"/>
a very easy economic return is given the
<Sync time="187.235"/>
massive shortage in me- in the need for organ donations ,
<Sync time="190.600"/>
we think organ farms are likely and again this would lead to human agents being stripped of their organs and used
<Sync time="196.320"/>
as a means to an end . something that we can see huge ethical problem
<Sync time="199.705"/>
and something that shouldn't
<Sync time="200.940"/>
uh potentially be allowed . we also think there's a potential
<Sync time="203.855"/>
for human
<Sync time="204.835"/>
uh for for humans to have their rights stripped . we think there's a
<Sync time="208.140"/>
massive potential that
<Sync time="209.480"/>
no matter what type of economic end you want to retreat from this ,
<Sync time="212.990"/>
that whatever clone is the result of this process
<Sync time="215.775"/>
is likely going to face
<Sync time="217.070"/>
massive stigmatization ,
<Sync time="218.575"/>
massive harms to their identity ,
<Sync time="220.325"/>
and ultimately are likely to have their rights stripped to the point in which
<Sync time="223.710"/>
they are no longer human ,
<Sync time="225.140"/>
but that doesn't mean that these harms wouldn't
<Sync time="226.905"/>
gather on that person . it doesn't mean
<Sync time="229.275"/>
that this person this this clone
<Sync time="231.740"/>
wouldn't in-
<Sync time="232.520"/>
internalize the harms of such practices and given
<Sync time="235.285"/>
that these practices are likely to arise from such a process of human clothing cloning , we think we should cut it off
<Sync time="241.615"/>
at the head . we think we should ban human cloning to preten-
<Sync time="244.840"/>
to prevent these things
<Sync time="246.015"/>
from ever arising
<Sync time="247.310"/>
and for these reasons , we should ban human cloning .
<Sync time="250.725"/>
