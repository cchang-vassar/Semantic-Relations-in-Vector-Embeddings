we should adopt
<Sync time="1.710"/>
atheism .
<Sync time="2.770"/>
so in this round we're going to say that
<Sync time="4.450"/>
individuals on balance
<Sync time="6.050"/>
should be atheists and that
<Sync time="7.605"/>
as a society we should lean towards a society that embraces
<Sync time="10.945"/>
atheism
<Sync time="11.820"/>
and goes against religion .
<Sync time="13.460"/>
okay so a couple of reasons why we think we should adopt atheism .
<Sync time="16.800"/>
the first is based on logic . so we would say
<Sync time="19.485"/>
that uh
<Sync time="20.460"/>
religious beliefs are antithetical to logic
<Sync time="23.440"/>
for a few reasons . the first is that religious beliefs
<Sync time="26.150"/>
openly denounce %hes
<Sync time="27.967"/>
openly accept the fact that the beliefs they hold are not based on any sort of factual understanding .
<Sync time="33.130"/>
it's based on a leap of faith that individuals take
<Sync time="35.645"/>
based on some assorted arguments
<Sync time="37.980"/>
made within uh with within religious texts
<Sync time="40.840"/>
but from their uh faith
<Sync time="42.360"/>
a leap of faith
<Sync time="43.190"/>
in the god that they choose to believe in . it is an outward acceptance
<Sync time="46.580"/>
that these types of leaps of faith ,
<Sync time="48.400"/>
those that go directly against logic ,
<Sync time="50.350"/>
are acceptable within the society .
<Sync time="52.490"/>
we think that when individuals choose to adopt
<Sync time="54.970"/>
these religious beliefs
<Sync time="56.360"/>
it ultimately leads to a situation which individuals are more prone to b-
<Sync time="60.865"/>
to buy into information
<Sync time="62.275"/>
without any sort of logical backing .
<Sync time="64.140"/>
and we think this is problematic within society .
<Sync time="66.490"/>
we think in the status quo we're in a society where information is so dispersed and so
<Sync time="71.360"/>
disseminated on to people
<Sync time="72.930"/>
that there is a massive problem with misinformation
<Sync time="75.590"/>
and people's inability to check themselves . we think
<Sync time="78.155"/>
that religion does not breed in and of itself
<Sync time="80.840"/>
skeptical
<Sync time="81.570"/>
individuals .
<Sync time="82.435"/>
and that skeptical individuals are necessary
<Sync time="84.930"/>
in a time like today
<Sync time="86.385"/>
where information and misinformation
<Sync time="88.380"/>
is becoming so much more outwardly
<Sync time="90.860"/>
uh outwardly open
<Sync time="92.515"/>
and so much more prevalent within our society . so we think
<Sync time="95.670"/>
that religion
<Sync time="97.055"/>
does not allow individuals to become skeptical . and in fact
<Sync time="100.020"/>
breeds within individuals
<Sync time="101.580"/>
an idea that they should buy into the information that they believe and they feel to be correct .
<Sync time="106.780"/>
buying into information based on feeling 
<Sync time="109.035"/>
rather than logic 
<Sync time="110.165"/>
and rather than fact . we think this is the type of world
<Sync time="112.865"/>
that is bred in the status quo in which individuals
<Sync time="115.340"/>
vote against their ind-
<Sync time="116.480"/>
interests in which individuals
<Sync time="118.010"/>
denounce science in places like the united states by denouncing global warming
<Sync time="121.880"/>
because it doesn't feel like it is correct to them . we think that that type of understanding , that type
<Sync time="126.305"/>
of way of thinking that is bred by religion ,
<Sync time="128.680"/>
is problematic and should be discarded .
<Sync time="131.110"/>
finally we think that religion
<Sync time="132.715"/>
b- on balance has been a negative thing within human history .
<Sync time="136.350"/>
recognize that there is a massive history of conflict associated
<Sync time="139.490"/>
with all types of religion , whether this is religions
<Sync time="142.080"/>
warring against each other or people using religion
<Sync time="144.655"/>
as a justification for types of colonization that we've seen throughout the world ,
<Sync time="148.630"/>
enslavement , these types of things , these systems of oppression were justified on religious basis
<Sync time="153.485"/>
and these types of systems of repression , while not as problematic ,
<Sync time="156.720"/>
still exists in the status quo
<Sync time="158.390"/>
with discrimination against minority groups ,
<Sync time="160.500"/>
patriarchal oppression of women 
<Sync time="162.460"/>
and discrimination against
<Sync time="163.550"/>
l_g_b_t_q people . all justified
<Sync time="165.995"/>
under religious beliefs . we think that these types of backward notions based again
<Sync time="169.930"/>
on feelings and beliefs rather than on logical understandings of how we should treat our fellow man ,
<Sync time="174.950"/>
these are problematic aspects of religion
<Sync time="176.985"/>
that society
<Sync time="177.905"/>
needs to be willing to discard . we also think that religion
<Sync time="180.680"/>
pushes morality on to individuals in a way
<Sync time="183.085"/>
that is unacceptable . we think that morality
<Sync time="185.355"/>
as a construct is something that individuals
<Sync time="187.550"/>
and society should be able to construct
<Sync time="189.455"/>
based on what is necessary for their times , but that religion pushes all time morality
<Sync time="193.940"/>
onto a modern society that is advancing far faster
<Sync time="197.090"/>
than that religion
<Sync time="197.940"/>
ever could have predicted
<Sync time="199.020"/>
or ever could have planned for .
<Sync time="200.420"/>
we think that these types of values , while in part
<Sync time="202.700"/>
are still important a- and in part are acceptable ,
<Sync time="205.615"/>
these are the values that aren't going to be discarded
<Sync time="208.030"/>
when individuals
<Sync time="209.050"/>
by and large switch to atheism , but rather
<Sync time="211.320"/>
the types of discriminatory biases that come with religion
<Sync time="214.730"/>
and the type of illogical thinking that comes with a religion .
<Sync time="217.480"/>
we think these things are discarded when you embrace atheism 
<Sync time="220.595"/>
and that's why we should adopt atheism .
<Sync time="223.370"/>
