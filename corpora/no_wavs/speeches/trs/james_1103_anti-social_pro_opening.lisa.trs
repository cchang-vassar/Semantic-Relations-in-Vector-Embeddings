we should abolish the antisocial behavior orders .
<Sync time="4.815"/>
so these antisocial behavior orders are
<Sync time="8.115"/>
a
<Sync time="9.180"/>
facet of british law
<Sync time="10.920"/>
basically in which someone can be
<Sync time="13.760"/>
uh banned from doing a certain act that's causing trouble in the community .
<Sync time="17.720"/>
so maybe
<Sync time="18.475"/>
if they're harassing somebody or if they're
<Sync time="20.775"/>
causing a lot of loud noise late at night
<Sync time="22.970"/>
things like that ,
<Sync time="23.890"/>
one of these antisocial behavior orders can be issued by a civil court ,
<Sync time="27.850"/>
which would then
<Sync time="28.685"/>
prevent the person from continuing that behavior
<Sync time="31.330"/>
and then
<Sync time="32.130"/>
if they breach that order it works a little bit like a restraining order in that there would be various penalties that would follow
<Sync time="38.135"/>
from that breach .
<Sync time="39.500"/>

<Sync time="40.080"/>
so with this in mind , we have two main arguments for why we should abolish these antisocial behavior orders .
<Sync time="45.160"/>
the first is that
<Sync time="46.590"/>
criminal penalties
<Sync time="47.780"/>
ought not follow from civil court rulings .
<Sync time="51.240"/>
what do we mean by this ?
<Sync time="52.740"/>
so britain is a common law country , which means that criminal law
<Sync time="56.085"/>
and civil law are conducted
<Sync time="58.000"/>
separately by separate courts .
<Sync time="60.360"/>
so in a criminal court
<Sync time="62.785"/>
the
<Sync time="63.600"/>
balance of evidence is beyond the shadow of a doubt .
<Sync time="66.900"/>
so you have to go completely beyond any reasonable doubt in order to
<Sync time="71.160"/>
convict someone in a criminal court ,
<Sync time="73.570"/>
whereas in a civil court
<Sync time="75.680"/>
the balance of evidence is fifty percent . so if you can prove that someone is fifty one percent likely to have been guilty
<Sync time="81.445"/>
then you can get them in a civil court .
<Sync time="84.420"/>
so these antisocial behavior orders are issued by civil courts which means that the balance of evidence
<Sync time="89.580"/>
is fifty one percent
<Sync time="91.260"/>
for the
<Sync time="92.370"/>
uh whoever is bringing the charge ,
<Sync time="94.715"/>
but these antisocial behavior orders also can carry criminal penalties . people can
<Sync time="99.955"/>
run the risk of very serious financial
<Sync time="102.720"/>
penalties or
<Sync time="104.060"/>
long periods of public service
<Sync time="105.770"/>
etcetera if they violate these orders .
<Sync time="108.230"/>
so what that means is that
<Sync time="109.500"/>
punishments which normally would have a very high standard of evidence to actually be
<Sync time="114.245"/>
kin-
<Sync time="114.770"/>
carried out against somebody are now being carried out with a much lower
<Sync time="117.935"/>
standard of evidence .
<Sync time="119.455"/>
we think that that is fundamentally unjust . that when the court system was set up
<Sync time="123.835"/>
with this very high standard of evidence for criminal punishments , it's because
<Sync time="127.720"/>
these are very severe punishments and we need to be sure that people
<Sync time="130.720"/>
are actually guilty before we carry them out against them .
<Sync time="134.440"/>
but these antisocial behavior orders essentially allow
<Sync time="137.990"/>
people to
<Sync time="139.010"/>
convict anybody that they think is probably guilty and then carry out the harshest punishments possible
<Sync time="144.225"/>
in british society .
<Sync time="145.725"/>
at that point we think that it's very likely that many innocent people are going to suffer
<Sync time="149.700"/>
from these
<Sync time="150.580"/>
harsher penalties because the standard for proof
<Sync time="153.060"/>
is so low .
<Sync time="154.620"/>
we think that this is fundamentally unjust , that it blurs the lines between criminal law and civil law
<Sync time="159.800"/>
and that therefore it ought to be
<Sync time="161.505"/>
abolished .
<Sync time="163.050"/>
our second argument is an argument against
<Sync time="165.580"/>
vagueness in the law .
<Sync time="167.770"/>
we think that fundamentally these antisocial behavior orders can be construed to ban
<Sync time="172.590"/>
almost any sort of behavior and we don't think that you should have a law
<Sync time="176.220"/>
be this broad .
<Sync time="177.715"/>
it's certainly true that we don't want people to harass one another but we already have laws against that
<Sync time="183.080"/>
in every country in the world including britain .
<Sync time="185.725"/>
in the same way we see that
<Sync time="187.170"/>
it's probably not good for people to
<Sync time="189.285"/>
make lots of noise at certain times of day , but again
<Sync time="192.140"/>
lots of cities have municipal codes that prevent that .
<Sync time="194.870"/>
we think that there are better ways to deal with the problems that these antisocial behavior orders address
<Sync time="199.985"/>
which are much
<Sync time="200.850"/>
clearer .
<Sync time="201.890"/>
we think it's important that people
<Sync time="203.640"/>
understand what the law is
<Sync time="205.970"/>
before they can be charged with breaking the law .
<Sync time="208.670"/>
it's very likely the case that everyone knows that what they're doing is wrong
<Sync time="212.020"/>
if they're going to run up against an antisocial behavior order ,
<Sync time="214.930"/>
but whether something is right or wrong is a distinct issue from whether or not it's legal .
<Sync time="219.050"/>
we think that it should be
<Sync time="220.090"/>
crystal clear to every citizen
<Sync time="222.180"/>
exactly what is permitted ,
<Sync time="223.740"/>
what is forbidden , and what the penalties are
<Sync time="225.935"/>
for forbidden behavior
<Sync time="227.770"/>
otherwise we run the risk of holding different people to different standards such as punishing perhaps
<Sync time="232.935"/>
people of color at a harsher rate
<Sync time="234.905"/>
than white people , for instance .
<Sync time="236.765"/>
we think that any time you allow
<Sync time="238.430"/>
vagueness into the law you allow more bias on behalf of judges
<Sync time="242.175"/>
and ultimately that this will undermine the justice system as a fair way to deliver punishment .
<Sync time="247.570"/>
so for these two reasons we should abolish the antisocial
<Sync time="250.460"/>
behavior orders .
<Sync time="251.800"/>
thank you .
