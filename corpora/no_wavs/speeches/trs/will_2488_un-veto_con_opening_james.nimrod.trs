<Sync time="2.215"/>
i'm proud to stand in opposition of
<Sync time="4.140"/>
today's motion , that we should abolish the pee five veto power on the security council  .
<Sync time="8.590"/>
two independent points of analysis ,
<Sync time="10.790"/>
first , that the veto power
<Sync time="12.440"/>
assures stability in the security council , and on the u_n at
<Sync time="15.400"/>
large ,
<Sync time="16.080"/>
and secondly ,
<Sync time="17.120"/>
that it increases the incentive for clientelism , when you get rid of the veto
<Sync time="20.855"/>
power .
<Sync time="21.960"/>
but first , i want to make a note on the framework .
<Sync time="24.435"/>
i think it's important to recognize , that
<Sync time="26.350"/>
when gov says : oh well , there's this issue with membership , that some of these people are outdated , and then
<Sync time="31.555"/>
they provide you with structural reasons why it's hard to move this membership around .
<Sync time="35.765"/>
i think it's important to recognize ,
<Sync time="37.745"/>
that that's probably not true ,
<Sync time="40.100"/>
that you can create voting procedures for eliminating or adding members of the sig-
<Sync time="44.530"/>
uh like with veto power ,
<Sync time="46.490"/>
much in the same way that we change the membership of the security council , on a fairly regular basis .
<Sync time="52.530"/>
these are
<Sync time="53.285"/>
things that change over time ,
<Sync time="55.640"/>
and i think we already have mechanisms , that we apply to other aspects of the u. n. , that solve for those systemic changes pretty well .
<Sync time="62.195"/>
so , i don't think we would have much difficulty in adjusting for these
<Sync time="65.615"/>
shifts .
<Sync time="66.855"/>
so , under the first argument , that there is
<Sync time="69.620"/>
better stability
<Sync time="70.865"/>
in a world with a veto power .
<Sync time="73.090"/>
it's important to recognize ,
<Sync time="74.655"/>
that
<Sync time="75.280"/>
it ensures that nothing passes , that would initiate major conflict within the u_n .
<Sync time="79.495"/>
what i mean by this is that , for example , a resolution against russia
<Sync time="83.650"/>
wouldn't do very much to actually
<Sync time="85.590"/>
solve for this type of thing ,
<Sync time="87.060"/>
right ? like the u_s media , and like western media at large ,
<Sync time="90.210"/>
often reports pretty extensively on things that russia does , that are bad , it's not like nobody knew about the invasion of ukraine .
<Sync time="97.550"/>
the problem is that when you formalize these things through the u_n ,
<Sync time="100.645"/>
the most significant impact is just irritating russia ,
<Sync time="104.145"/>
and situations that are pretty tense ,
<Sync time="106.650"/>
it can absolutely
<Sync time="107.860"/>
spark rage .
<Sync time="109.115"/>
i think a good example of this is actually what gov brings up :
<Sync time="112.160"/>
about
<Sync time="112.620"/>
resolutions against israel , in favor of palestine .
<Sync time="115.990"/>
those types of resolutions are very likely to enrage the united states , in such a
<Sync time="120.330"/>
way that could actually lead to conflict in the region .
<Sync time="123.250"/>
i think even if it's not an all out war ,
<Sync time="125.530"/>
even muscle flexing usually results in deaths , because of brinkmanship and border conflicts , and things like that  .
<Sync time="131.560"/>
so ,
<Sync time="132.075"/>
it's key to continued membership as well , because
<Sync time="135.030"/>
nations are likely to leave the u_n , if they don't think it works to their advantage .
<Sync time="139.240"/>
this was talked about
<Sync time="140.080"/>
extensively in the lead up to the iraq war , back in two thousand and four .
<Sync time="144.170"/>
so ,
<Sync time="144.670"/>
i think it's worth recognizing then ,
<Sync time="146.600"/>
that the veto power is one of the only things actually ensuring the stability , and continuity , of the united nations .
<Sync time="153.290"/>
so , if you think that the u_n does
<Sync time="154.660"/>
literally anything that is beneficial to the l- global structure ,
<Sync time="158.240"/>
it's important to keep the veto in place .
<Sync time="160.610"/>
our second independent argument is that it increases incentives for clientelism , on their side of the house .
<Sync time="166.030"/>
why is this true ?
<Sync time="167.550"/>
so in the status quo ,
<Sync time="169.190"/>
if the u_s doesn't like something that's coming up to the plate ,
<Sync time="172.210"/>
they can just veto it 
<Sync time="173.330"/>
and it's not an issue anymore .
<Sync time="175.840"/>
on their side of the house though , this actually has to go through , what is referred to as , or what is
<Sync time="180.240"/>
nominally a democratic process .
<Sync time="182.600"/>
but the problem is that the u_s actually has a decent amount of states , that will just do whatever they tell them to do .
<Sync time="188.210"/>
israel is obviously the go to example of this ,
<Sync time="190.800"/>
but there are lots and lots of other states that , if the u_s was to just enact
<Sync time="194.560"/>
even a small amount of leverage against them ,
<Sync time="197.235"/>
they would just bow to pressure . this is true of pretty much all the hegemones that are on the security council , china has this power over a lot of members ,
<Sync time="204.720"/>
as does russia .
<Sync time="205.925"/>
so what happens then ,
<Sync time="207.560"/>
when you can't just veto things you don't like ,
<Sync time="210.010"/>
is there's an arms race to rack up as many clients as you can ,
<Sync time="213.600"/>
to bully as many smaller nations into voting your way .
<Sync time="217.220"/>
that results in a lot of harms , that usually means
<Sync time="220.360"/>
threat of sanctions
<Sync time="221.570"/>
from both sides .
<Sync time="222.800"/>
so , you have to choose who's going to hurt you less .
<Sync time="226.150"/>
it's worth recognizing then ,
<Sync time="227.880"/>
that if their concern ,
<Sync time="229.450"/>
on side government ,
<Sync time="230.610"/>
is ensuring that smaller nations have a say within the global infrastructure ,
<Sync time="235.315"/>
and have the ability to avoid punishment from larger nations for stepping out of line ,
<Sync time="239.710"/>
the way to do that
<Sync time="240.850"/>
isn't incentivizing larger nations to just bully them whenever they want something to be killed , or something to pass .
<Sync time="247.630"/>
given that ,
<Sync time="248.260"/>
i think it's really important to sustain the mechanism , that allows these large hegemons
<Sync time="253.100"/>
to get their way without
<Sync time="254.845"/>
like knocking down the smaller nations along the way . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="259.545"/>
