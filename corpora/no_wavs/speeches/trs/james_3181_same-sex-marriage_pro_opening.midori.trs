we should legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="3.540"/>
so i'm going to argue that
<Sync time="5.920"/>
countries around the world
<Sync time="7.090"/>
which had the rule of law
<Sync time="8.625"/>
and which generally protect people's rights
<Sync time="11.310"/>
should allow people to marry those of the same sex in the same way that they allow people
<Sync time="16.010"/>
to marry those of the opposite sex .
<Sync time="18.200"/>
we don't think that domestic partnership programs like what they have in germany right now
<Sync time="22.670"/>
are sufficient .
<Sync time="23.670"/>
we think that it needs to be
<Sync time="24.915"/>
an equal form of marriage with what people
<Sync time="27.300"/>
who are marrying someone of the opposite sex have access to .
<Sync time="30.780"/>
with that in mind ,
<Sync time="31.780"/>
three arguments for our side .
<Sync time="34.360"/>
the first is about equality under the law .
<Sync time="36.830"/>

<Sync time="37.590"/>
right now ,
<Sync time="38.270"/>
in germany for instance , if you happen to be
<Sync time="40.890"/>
attracted to the same sex
<Sync time="42.830"/>
you don't have equal protection under the law
<Sync time="45.230"/>
as someone who is attracted to the opposite sex .
<Sync time="47.770"/>
they are allowed to marry
<Sync time="49.245"/>
whoever they want and whoever they love and you are not .
<Sync time="52.265"/>
we think that fundamentally because
<Sync time="54.435"/>
the law in germany as well as in other liberal countries around the world
<Sync time="58.320"/>
is predicated on the idea that all citizens are equal citizens
<Sync time="62.380"/>
that this is fundamentally unfair .
<Sync time="64.665"/>

<Sync time="65.470"/>
you cannot claim to have equality under the law
<Sync time="67.850"/>
if some people are able to enter into a contract and other people are not .
<Sync time="71.730"/>

<Sync time="72.330"/>
in particular , we think this is egregious because
<Sync time="75.160"/>
sexual orientation is an intrinsic characteristic .
<Sync time="78.765"/>
uh research and the experience of millions of people around the world tells us that
<Sync time="84.015"/>
people don't choose who they are attracted to , but rather this is something
<Sync time="87.920"/>
that is intrinsic to us .
<Sync time="90.085"/>
this is similar to the way that we don't choose our sex or our race so we ought not be discriminated against
<Sync time="95.480"/>
on those terms .
<Sync time="97.700"/>
we're , broadly speaking , fine with limiting people's rights based on things like age which change over time ,
<Sync time="102.730"/>
but not based on things like sex or race .
<Sync time="105.250"/>
we think that sexual orientation is more like the latter
<Sync time="108.250"/>
than the former
<Sync time="109.390"/>
and therefore that we ought guarantee equality under the law for people
<Sync time="112.860"/>
regardless of their sexual orientation .
<Sync time="115.490"/>
and this would necessitate allowing people to marry
<Sync time="118.160"/>
whoever they want or whoever they love
<Sync time="120.150"/>
regardless of that person's sex .
<Sync time="123.150"/>
our second argument is about the legal benefits to same sex couples . 
<Sync time="128.345"/>
in america ,
<Sync time="130.030"/>
i know ,
<Sync time="130.705"/>
you're only allowed to visit someone
<Sync time="132.675"/>
in the hospital
<Sync time="133.880"/>
if you're a close relative . so brother , sister , son , father ,
<Sync time="137.720"/>
husband or wife .
<Sync time="139.160"/>
so before gay marriage was passed here 
<Sync time="141.720"/>
many times you would have
<Sync time="143.410"/>
a person's long term partner , someone they had been with for thirty years , who wasn't able to go visit them in the hospital
<Sync time="149.260"/>
because they technically weren't a close relative .
<Sync time="151.990"/>
this is just one example of the types of legal discrimination that gay people face
<Sync time="156.940"/>
if they aren't able to marry .
<Sync time="158.960"/>
we see that because the law privileges marriage over other types of relationship
<Sync time="163.170"/>
through things like legal privileges
<Sync time="165.090"/>
and tax status ,
<Sync time="166.400"/>
that we have to allow these benefits to accrue to people attracted to the same sex
<Sync time="170.645"/>
as well as those who are attracted to the opposite sex .
<Sync time="173.750"/>
otherwise legal discrimination against those groups
<Sync time="176.420"/>
percolates through every layer of society , which we think is fundamentally
<Sync time="180.450"/>
unacceptable , especially in liberal countries like germany .
<Sync time="184.170"/>

<Sync time="184.920"/>

<Sync time="185.960"/>
our third and final argument is that it is good for your country or your area in the long term 
<Sync time="191.280"/>
to legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="193.720"/>
we see that many areas in the united states which legalized same sex marriage
<Sync time="198.020"/>
early on and which gained a reputation for being tolerant ,
<Sync time="201.020"/>
saw an influx of highly talented workers .
<Sync time="204.235"/>
many people move to cities like boston , where which was the first major american city
<Sync time="208.930"/>
that had gay marriage ,
<Sync time="210.400"/>
because they saw that it was somewhere that was more accepting of their lifestyle .
<Sync time="213.810"/>
where people were more likely to treat them as equals
<Sync time="216.360"/>
than other parts of the country
<Sync time="217.850"/>
where they were denied access
<Sync time="219.415"/>
to certain legal protections and the right to marry .
<Sync time="222.420"/>
in the same way areas like san francisco that have historically been associated with tolerance for
<Sync time="227.990"/>
homosexuals have also seen that
<Sync time="230.120"/>
people move there because of this tolerance .
<Sync time="232.780"/>
so it becomes a pull factor that brings in
<Sync time="235.360"/>
qualified hardworking people from around your country
<Sync time="238.340"/>
or around the globe even if you legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="242.150"/>
so this ultimately is beneficial to the whole community , not just the people who want to have these types of marriage .
<Sync time="247.860"/>
for these reasons we should legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="250.640"/>
thank you .
