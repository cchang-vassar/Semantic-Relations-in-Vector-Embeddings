i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should lower the drinking age .
<Sync time="5.450"/>
three independent points , the first of which is that the s- specific standard the government sets , the age of majority ,
<Sync time="12.540"/>
is bad .
<Sync time="13.565"/>
and the reason for this is at the age of majority , the rights afforded to you ,
<Sync time="17.820"/>
like voting and things like that and
<Sync time="19.880"/>
driving and what not ,
<Sync time="21.540"/>
often lead to particular forms of development
<Sync time="24.550"/>
and uh maturity
<Sync time="26.090"/>
itself . that is , that the age of majority
<Sync time="28.950"/>
isn't often not designed in such a way
<Sync time="31.660"/>
that it is like
<Sync time="32.750"/>
by eighteen , you will be mature enough to do a lot of these things .
<Sync time="36.515"/>
it is designed in such a way that affording you these privileges
<Sync time="39.870"/>
will get you to become a more mature person by exposing you to new things in life .
<Sync time="45.020"/>
there are also things that you want to have done before the age of majority
<Sync time="48.750"/>
to prepare you for things like voting ,
<Sync time="51.020"/>
but the point is that the age of maturity
<Sync time="53.090"/>
itself develops the individual .
<Sync time="55.215"/>
this is important then because we think that drinking is something that is
<Sync time="58.995"/>
a particularly important decision ,
<Sync time="61.315"/>
not just in terms of the way that it can affect your life ,
<Sync time="64.300"/>
but also in terms of the fact that you need significant amounts of information about it
<Sync time="68.410"/>
before you can really inf-
<Sync time="70.030"/>
participate in informed consent .
<Sync time="72.270"/>
what we mean by informed consent
<Sync time="74.195"/>
is that an individual has to be aware of the consequences of a particular action
<Sync time="78.745"/>
before we really begin to respect their right to consent into that action .
<Sync time="83.090"/>
a lot of government's case circles around consent ,
<Sync time="85.915"/>
but the problem with this
<Sync time="87.420"/>
is that if an individual
<Sync time="88.870"/>
isn't old enough to understand the consequences the action ,
<Sync time="92.170"/>
it isn't reasonable to call that consenting into the action
<Sync time="95.460"/>
or autonomy by any means .
<Sync time="97.800"/>
our second independent point
<Sync time="99.390"/>
is that people will always drink before the drinking age .
<Sync time="103.600"/>
gov makes a lot of noise over the fact
<Sync time="105.845"/>
that people tend to abuse the drinking
<Sync time="108.025"/>
age
<Sync time="108.350"/>
um and drink before it's legal .
<Sync time="110.515"/>
the problem is that the reason people do that
<Sync time="113.330"/>
is because
<Sync time="114.200"/>
drinking is seen as more or less a status symbol ,
<Sync time="117.200"/>
something that people do to be rebellious or as a cultural thing .
<Sync time="121.230"/>
for example , in france , where the drinking age is much lower ,
<Sync time="123.990"/>
people start drinking
<Sync time="125.000"/>
at an even younger age .
<Sync time="126.860"/>
so if you can start drinking at like sixteen , then you just start actually doing it at fourteen .
<Sync time="131.925"/>
the problem with this is twofold : one ,
<Sync time="134.860"/>
the information inbalance that i discussed earlier
<Sync time="137.450"/>
scales out to an even greater extent the younger you go .
<Sync time="140.680"/>
so , if you let people drink at eighteen ,
<Sync time="143.620"/>
air- at , yeah , at eighteen , and then they start drinking
<Sync time="146.470"/>
actually at like fifteen or sixteen ,
<Sync time="148.610"/>
then those information the lack of ability to access meaningful information on the practice
<Sync time="153.370"/>
is even greater .
<Sync time="154.580"/>
but secondly , there become significant health impacts at such a young age
<Sync time="158.770"/>
that , in addition to problems with binge drinking ,
<Sync time="161.090"/>
there are just demonstrated
<Sync time="162.520"/>
pediatric studies that show that brain development is significantly damaged by drinking at a young age .
<Sync time="168.080"/>
given that then ,
<Sync time="169.060"/>
it's reasonable for us to put limits that ensure that the goal post is significantly higher .
<Sync time="173.760"/>
that is , if we tell people you can drink at twenty-one
<Sync time="176.610"/>
and they start drinking at eighteen instead ,
<Sync time="178.710"/>
that is significantly preferable .
<Sync time="181.090"/>
our third and final independent point is parental rights .
<Sync time="184.640"/>
so , we believe that especially at a young age , like in your teenage years ,
<Sync time="189.210"/>
children , again ,
<Sync time="190.220"/>
don't have access to the necessary information to make informed decisions on everything that they do .
<Sync time="195.100"/>
given that , we afford a lot of latitude to parents
<Sync time="198.365"/>
in being essentially the proxies for their best interest , because parents do have access to that information .
<Sync time="204.350"/>
they've lived longer lives and understand more about the world .
<Sync time="208.000"/>
so with drinking particularly then ,
<Sync time="210.130"/>
we think that children are
<Sync time="211.560"/>
uninformed in the consequences of this action
<Sync time="214.465"/>
and as such , it is reasonable to proxy off the decision about whether or not they can engage in drinking
<Sync time="219.660"/>
to a parent .
<Sync time="220.880"/>
the problem is so , obviously , like a lot of the time , particularly in the united states , there is a culture of parents ,
<Sync time="227.080"/>
if they are okay with it ,
<Sync time="228.540"/>
just allowing their kids to have drinks um before it's legal ,
<Sync time="232.185"/>
and usually this isn't cracked down on .
<Sync time="234.360"/>
but ,
<Sync time="235.245"/>
if you would lower the drinking age to such a rate
<Sync time="237.800"/>
that it's just
<Sync time="238.580"/>
legal for children to do of their own volition ,
<Sync time="240.860"/>
parents can't make that decision for them
<Sync time="243.320"/>
and as such , you lose the ability to proxy out that decision to someone that's more informed .
<Sync time="248.120"/>
we think that at this age , the parent is the past proxy because of the lack of information the child has
<Sync time="253.195"/>
and as such , we should ensure that parents have the latitude to make this decision ,
<Sync time="257.110"/>
not children . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="259.860"/>
