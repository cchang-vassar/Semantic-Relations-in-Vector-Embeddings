the utility
<Sync time="2.245"/>
to a potential life
<Sync time="4.105"/>
that is a human because it has the potential to become human ,
<Sync time="7.970"/>
because being a human is about
<Sync time="10.050"/>
being able to continue
<Sync time="11.755"/>
to grow as a human ,
<Sync time="14.230"/>
not only does the government
<Sync time="16.220"/>
not make a lot of sense
<Sync time="17.910"/>
and rely on
<Sync time="19.075"/>
total logical statements
<Sync time="21.435"/>
it's also extremely
<Sync time="23.985"/>
utilitarian .
<Sync time="26.340"/>
in a debate that is very emotional .
<Sync time="29.040"/>
in a situation that is very emotional .
<Sync time="31.420"/>
you can't always ignore what's going on with the woman
<Sync time="35.300"/>
just because you
<Sync time="36.845"/>
prefer to look away and weigh utilitarian costs .
<Sync time="40.795"/>

<Sync time="41.600"/>
there's more to
<Sync time="42.940"/>
anguish than just well
<Sync time="44.720"/>
anguish is
<Sync time="45.875"/>
you know not as bad as death .
<Sync time="49.230"/>
i'm gonna discuss a few things on my side of the house and through my discussion
<Sync time="52.890"/>
of the
<Sync time="54.065"/>
um
<Sync time="55.240"/>
of why partial birth abortions must be allowed i'm also going to oppose
<Sync time="58.840"/>
what was said
<Sync time="59.845"/>
on the government side of the house .
<Sync time="61.530"/>
so first let's address the question
<Sync time="63.130"/>
when is partial birth abortion
<Sync time="65.680"/>
actually utilized ?
<Sync time="67.650"/>
let's put some context into this debate
<Sync time="70.320"/>
because no woman waits until their second or third trimester to abort a fetus
<Sync time="74.600"/>
just for fun .
<Sync time="75.700"/>
on well , i'll just go through five , six , seven months of morning sickness , which is actually all day long sickness ,
<Sync time="81.170"/>
feeling a baby ki- a fetus kicking around inside of me ,
<Sync time="84.400"/>
feeling sick ,
<Sync time="85.210"/>
having emotional ups and downs ,
<Sync time="86.710"/>
growing this fetus inside of me but now it just changed my mind .
<Sync time="90.415"/>
that is rarely the case .
<Sync time="92.475"/>
that is almost never the case .
<Sync time="94.555"/>
what we are talking about
<Sync time="96.390"/>
are specific types of cases
<Sync time="98.330"/>
where the mother's at risk either physically or emotionally ,
<Sync time="101.140"/>

<Sync time="101.780"/>
or the fetus is at risk ,
<Sync time="103.910"/>
or the mother simply didn't know she was pregnant until it is too late to have any other kind of abortion .
<Sync time="109.410"/>
we think , and that is
<Sync time="110.630"/>
often in the case of teen pec- pregnancies ,
<Sync time="113.015"/>
we think tha- these are all
<Sync time="114.615"/>
that these all give us a little bit more contextual understanding
<Sync time="118.180"/>
of who this woman is standing in front of us . this is somebody
<Sync time="121.065"/>
who
<Sync time="122.235"/>
who has i mean the anguish of having
<Sync time="124.875"/>
a parasite
<Sync time="126.000"/>
inside your womb ,
<Sync time="127.570"/>
kicking you from within ,
<Sync time="128.990"/>
that it's not something that can simply be disregarded and said well
<Sync time="132.110"/>
death is worse . you know what ,
<Sync time="134.140"/>
death is not what we're talking about here .
<Sync time="136.160"/>
partial birth abortion is
<Sync time="137.840"/>
the termination of a pack of cells .
<Sync time="140.300"/>
it's not a life .
<Sync time="141.590"/>
it might be a potential life but it's not a life yet .
<Sync time="144.180"/>
right now , and this brings me to my second point ,
<Sync time="146.930"/>
a fetus is simply a parasite inside the woman's body and the woman is the one with bodily autonomy . she must have
<Sync time="151.685"/>
complete autonomy over her body
<Sync time="154.125"/>
and that means up until the very minute that the parasite is out of her , that the fetus is out of her ,
<Sync time="158.485"/>
she should have complete control over what happens to it .
<Sync time="161.145"/>
until the fetus is delivered
<Sync time="163.180"/>
they the fetus is totally reliant on the woman's body . it is a parasite .
<Sync time="166.610"/>
it is her decision .
<Sync time="169.060"/>
fetuses
<Sync time="169.750"/>
literally suck calcium from a woman's bones , they steal
<Sync time="172.770"/>
nutrients , they abuse the mother's body from within .
<Sync time="175.615"/>
it has to be a women's choice to terminate the pregnancy at any stage throughout 
<Sync time="179.520"/>
especially bearing in mind that it's rarely
<Sync time="182.040"/>
um
<Sync time="183.055"/>
that it's really done outside of very extreme circumstances .
<Sync time="186.590"/>
uh
<Sync time="187.465"/>
we say this idea that like it's clear the fetus would be able to survive at this point . we say , first of all ,
<Sync time="192.575"/>
it's not clear at all .
<Sync time="194.170"/>
there's a good reason why it's inside the womb for nine months . it
<Sync time="196.700"/>
needs those nutrients . it needs that protective atmosphere in order to
<Sync time="199.800"/>
uh
<Sync time="200.330"/>
to grow and develop and it's a very it's not clear at all that a fetus would survive
<Sync time="204.220"/>
um earlier than in eight through nine month uh
<Sync time="206.720"/>
birth
<Sync time="207.305"/>
but second of all to what end are we talking about here ?
<Sync time="209.820"/>
right like if we can grow fee- a fetus outside of the womb
<Sync time="212.800"/>
completely , does that mean that women will never be allowed to have an abortion , will never be able to decide actually this was a mistake
<Sync time="217.990"/>
i took i ha- i took protective measures ,
<Sync time="219.970"/>
or i was raped or whatever it is , and they won't be allowed to uh
<Sync time="223.140"/>
won't be allowed to terminate at all ?
<Sync time="225.570"/>
what about
<Sync time="226.420"/>
men masturbating ? is that going to be not allowed because you'll be able to
<Sync time="229.815"/>
uh facilitate out of the womb uh uh
<Sync time="232.800"/>
out of the womb
<Sync time="234.110"/>
conception ?
<Sync time="235.000"/>
we think that these are things that you need to take into account when you're talking about this life .
<Sync time="238.270"/>
the fact is that the only way we can determine life is once it is actually
<Sync time="241.530"/>
independent
<Sync time="242.310"/>
in and of itself , before that , the woman must have bodily autonomy .
<Sync time="245.740"/>
