we should
<Sync time="1.310"/>
absolutely ba? trans fat
<Sync time="3.560"/>
usage in any food , and the first reason for this is because it is incredibly unsafe . there is no known safe amount of
<Sync time="11.590"/>
ha- a bit to just ingest ,
<Sync time="13.315"/>
and that's the reason why so many places have
<Sync time="15.930"/>
banned it .
<Sync time="16.720"/>
secondarily , because it's incredibly difficult to consent or know exactly what you're eating when it comes to trans fat
<Sync time="22.960"/>
and the consequences associated with it .
<Sync time="25.160"/>
and third ,
<Sync time="25.940"/>
because like we don't need trans fat , you can just replace it with something else that isn't as bad .
<Sync time="30.950"/>
so , let's first start by talking about this th-
<Sync time="33.610"/>
like
<Sync time="33.880"/>
incredibly important safety concerns that are associated with trans fats specifically .
<Sync time="38.520"/>
so ,
<Sync time="39.635"/>
h- let's start by saying that like
<Sync time="41.395"/>
heart disease is like the number one cause of death in developed countries around the world , in the entire western world .
<Sync time="48.120"/>
and in addition to it being the number one cause of death ,
<Sync time="50.950"/>
we spend like billions of dollars
<Sync time="53.220"/>
bill- holi- probably tens of billions of dollars , maybe even more than that ,
<Sync time="56.530"/>
on combatting things like health disease , and on fighting a lot of the consequences that are associated with
<Sync time="61.440"/>
heart disease .
<Sync time="62.435"/>
but it's not even limited to that , like trans fat can also lead to things like obesity , diabetes ,
<Sync time="67.840"/>
uh
<Sync time="68.375"/>
some people even think it could lead to like it could help us like alzheimer's , there's like a whole long list of things in which trans fat
<Sync time="74.260"/>
could lead these harms .
<Sync time="75.580"/>

<Sync time="76.205"/>
and it has a very direct way of doing that .
<Sync time="79.190"/>
like research shows that like 
<Sync time="80.650"/>
trans fat like it's like uh like one of the primary things for like a heart attack or a stroke as like a clogged artery ,
<Sync time="86.590"/>
the like
<Sync time="87.060"/>
worst of food that you're intaking is like trans fat
<Sync time="89.710"/>
leads to the clogging of these arteries ,
<Sync time="91.690"/>
there's just like a direct link there .
<Sync time="93.450"/>
so it's not like there's a some mystery about whether or not trans fat is healthy or or trans fat is actually all that bad .
<Sync time="100.160"/>
science is in , science says trans fat
<Sync time="102.860"/>
does cause all of these problems .
<Sync time="105.110"/>
so , this is 
<Sync time="106.710"/>
v- very very bad . this is especially bad given how much it's abused and the degree to which it's used in foods , and it was prevalent in foods
<Sync time="113.760"/>
because it was so safe .
<Sync time="116.020"/>
but
<Sync time="116.480"/>
all of these safety concerns are compounded by the fact that people don't understand the risks of eating it .
<Sync time="121.850"/>
keep in mind that like there's a whole lot of
<Sync time="123.790"/>
fats that you can see on the back of a package . like
<Sync time="126.045"/>
how can you know the difference between like a trans fat or a polyunsaturated fat or a polymonosaturated fat
<Sync time="132.570"/>
or like
<Sync time="133.150"/>
unsaturated versus saturated fats , like
<Sync time="135.240"/>
these things get incredibly complicated and these things have widely differing health consequences
<Sync time="139.770"/>
on people ,
<Sync time="140.465"/>
and
<Sync time="141.290"/>
it's very like l- you should not have a degree to know you like a degree in chemistry
<Sync time="145.825"/>
or biology to know whether or not the food you're eating is healthy 
<Sync time="149.630"/>
or the food that you're eating is safe , and this is why the regulation of these kinds of things
<Sync time="153.490"/>
specifically is important .
<Sync time="154.940"/>
but furthermore , like
<Sync time="157.070"/>
like corporations are oftentimes like
<Sync time="159.255"/>
m- like stu- like like very evil about these things .
<Sync time="162.225"/>
they want you they want to use these cheaper options that are oftentimes less safe ,
<Sync time="167.150"/>
so they try to hide the like bad consequences from yo-
<Sync time="170.000"/>
from you , so that way you keep eating it .
<Sync time="172.010"/>
and this is like very very bad .
<Sync time="174.420"/>
uh and this is further compounded by the fact that when all the corporations that are profit seeking are making the same decision ,
<Sync time="181.010"/>
it's very difficult to opt out of this , you like have to eat trans fat
<Sync time="185.000"/>
because all the food supply they are using is like all the food that you eat is using it and you may not even know it ,
<Sync time="190.860"/>
and you don't even know how harmful it is for you , so all that's bad .
<Sync time="194.295"/>
but ,
<Sync time="194.870"/>
finally , all of these
<Sync time="196.465"/>
points to a reason why we should ban trans fat , because like
<Sync time="199.425"/>
we don't need it .
<Sync time="200.770"/>
the unique
<Sync time="201.340"/>
benefit of a trans fat is that like it's semi-solid at room temperature , so it's a lot like hard like butter or soft like an oil or things like that .
<Sync time="208.840"/>
but like ,
<Sync time="209.360"/>
whoopty freeking doo , 
<Sync time="210.740"/>
you can just like soften your butter in the oven for like thirty seconds and it's going to be roughly the same consistency or things like that .
<Sync time="217.630"/>
like this is a nonsense excuse .
<Sync time="219.490"/>
or you can just try to come up with like safer alternatives , like like
<Sync time="222.620"/>
palm oil isn't perfect , like you can use that too instead of like like crisco larder things li- like a crisco
<Sync time="228.950"/>
um shor- like shortening is the big culprit , things like that .
<Sync time="232.395"/>

<Sync time="233.060"/>
like ,
<Sync time="233.800"/>
the only consequence that forcing substitution of trans fat has 
<Sync time="237.655"/>
is
<Sync time="238.405"/>
it's going to mean that less people are going to die , which is a good thing ,
<Sync time="242.010"/>
and it means that corporations have to spend more money figuring it out .
<Sync time="245.310"/>
like oh no ,
<Sync time="246.460"/>
multi t-
<Sync time="247.110"/>
billion dollar corporations have to spend money
<Sync time="250.110"/>
to like figure out an alternative that isn't going to kill people in their food .
<Sync time="253.700"/>
i think this is a pretty reasonable restriction to put on people .
<Sync time="256.680"/>
so for all those reasons , we should ban trans fat usage in food .
<Sync time="261.379"/>
