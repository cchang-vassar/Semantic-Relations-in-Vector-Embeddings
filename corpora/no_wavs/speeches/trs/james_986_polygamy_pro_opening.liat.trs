we should legalize polygamy .
<Sync time="3.105"/>
so , just so everyone's clear what we're talking about in this debate .
<Sync time="6.380"/>
we think that
<Sync time="7.230"/>
in countries where polygamy
<Sync time="8.790"/>
is currently illegal , such
<Sync time="10.340"/>
as the united states , britain ,
<Sync time="12.250"/>
canada ,
<Sync time="13.000"/>
that these countries should stop prosecuting
<Sync time="15.140"/>

<Sync time="15.380"/>
people for polygamy , should add it to the books as something
<Sync time="18.110"/>
legal if they need to do so because of a civil code ,
<Sync time="20.575"/>
or get rid of a law that prevents it
<Sync time="22.310"/>
if they
<Sync time="22.590"/>
have common law ,
<Sync time="23.740"/>
all that .
<Sync time="24.480"/>
but on top of that , by polygamy we mean the practice of
<Sync time="26.890"/>
someone
<Sync time="27.010"/>
taking more than one spouse . we're okay with this
<Sync time="29.440"/>

<Sync time="29.490"/>
being
<Sync time="29.815"/>
one husband with many wives , one wife with many husbands ,
<Sync time="33.120"/>
or if that district would otherwise allow it , you could also have
<Sync time="36.095"/>
same sex polygas-
<Sync time="37.475"/>
polygamists marriages ,
<Sync time="38.170"/>

<Sync time="38.470"/>
we're fine with that if it would otherwise
<Sync time="39.940"/>
be legal in that country .
<Sync time="41.570"/>
so 
<Sync time="41.895"/>
yes in the united states , no in germany , for instance .
<Sync time="45.240"/>

<Sync time="45.690"/>
so ,
<Sync time="46.040"/>
with that in mind , we have three arguments today .
<Sync time="48.830"/>
the first is that banning polygamy is tantamount to religious discrimination .
<Sync time="53.560"/>

<Sync time="53.610"/>
recognize that the reason
<Sync time="55.160"/>
why polygamy has been banned
<Sync time="56.690"/>
in countries like the united states or britain
<Sync time="58.970"/>
is because there's a strong norm against polygamy
<Sync time="61.565"/>
in certain
<Sync time="62.640"/>
christian
<Sync time="62.930"/>
uh denominations . we see that the catholic church , for instance , has preached against polygamy
<Sync time="67.700"/>
for hundreds
<Sync time="68.270"/>
and hundreds of years ,
<Sync time="69.220"/>
and that catholic countries overwhelmingly ,
<Sync time="71.415"/>
perhaps all of them ,
<Sync time="72.750"/>
ban polygamy . we think that first of all ,
<Sync time="75.290"/>

<Sync time="75.480"/>
it's unfair for countries to make law
<Sync time="77.870"/>
based on religious
<Sync time="78.570"/>
norms . we think that individuals should be free 
<Sync time="81.010"/>
to choose
<Sync time="81.895"/>
to follow or not to follow these religious laws .
<Sync time="84.770"/>
first of all ,
<Sync time="85.535"/>
if people don't have a real choice about following a religious custom ,
<Sync time="88.470"/>
then they're probably not actually doing 
<Sync time="89.800"/>
anything 
<Sync time="89.990"/>
to fulfill their spiritual obligations ,
<Sync time="92.475"/>
but on top of that
<Sync time="93.280"/>
we think that , for instance ,
<Sync time="94.170"/>
if you are a muslim living in a mn-
<Sync time="96.700"/>
predominantly catholic country ,
<Sync time="98.470"/>
you should still be able
<Sync time="99.505"/>
to practice polygamy because that's acceptable within the confines of your own faith .
<Sync time="104.090"/>

<Sync time="104.440"/>
a good example of this
<Sync time="106.025"/>
is why polygamy was banned in the united states .
<Sync time="108.890"/>
some of you may know that mormonism is
<Sync time="110.790"/>
a religion
<Sync time="111.070"/>
which originated in america
<Sync time="112.710"/>

<Sync time="112.840"/>
and which encouraged ,
<Sync time="114.365"/>
until very recently , its followers to
<Sync time="116.530"/>

<Sync time="116.550"/>
practice polygamy .
<Sync time="117.540"/>

<Sync time="117.690"/>
so the united states
<Sync time="119.810"/>
banned polygamy ,
<Sync time="120.830"/>
and used it as a way to prosecute mormons as a religious minority
<Sync time="124.630"/>
throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century .
<Sync time="127.160"/>
mormon leaders eventually changed their rules in order to end
<Sync time="129.960"/>
persecution
<Sync time="130.740"/>
by the american government .
<Sync time="132.780"/>
but we think that this is completely unjust ,
<Sync time="134.675"/>
and that if people wish to practice polygamy
<Sync time="137.450"/>
due to a certain religious obligation , that they should be free to do so ,
<Sync time="140.595"/>
in the same way
<Sync time="141.440"/>
that people are free to practice anything else religious that doesn't harm others .
<Sync time="144.870"/>

<Sync time="145.550"/>
our second argument is that polygamy is a victimless crime .
<Sync time="148.850"/>

<Sync time="148.940"/>
in general , we think that government should only intervene
<Sync time="151.905"/>
in people's personal freedom to limit it ,
<Sync time="154.175"/>
when there are actually going to be
<Sync time="155.740"/>
third party
<Sync time="156.560"/>
harms .
<Sync time="156.800"/>
we think that , for instance , it's okay to ban smoking
<Sync time="159.690"/>
because secondhand smoke
<Sync time="161.070"/>
puts other people at risk of lung cancer .
<Sync time="163.210"/>
it's okay to ban theft because you don't have a right to take other people's things .
<Sync time="166.665"/>
but we don't see any real harm to polygamy .
<Sync time="168.910"/>
why is this true ?
<Sync time="170.180"/>
so in order for people to get married they have to enter into a contract , which means that they can't be coerced because presumably
<Sync time="175.825"/>
they're going to have to go before a judge
<Sync time="177.250"/>
and
<Sync time="177.620"/>
say that they weren't coerced ,
<Sync time="178.960"/>
in order to get this marriage contract .
<Sync time="181.100"/>
rules like the minimum age for getting married are still going to exist ,
<Sync time="184.500"/>
so we're not worried about
<Sync time="185.550"/>
young women being pressured by older men into
<Sync time="187.780"/>
polygamous marriages ,
<Sync time="188.920"/>
like
<Sync time="188.950"/>
some people might say would happen .
<Sync time="190.210"/>

<Sync time="190.340"/>
we think that
<Sync time="191.155"/>
everyone will have to follow all other existing
<Sync time="193.510"/>

<Sync time="193.580"/>
laws . so at that point ,
<Sync time="194.840"/>
there's no real harm because people are consenting into this , and it ought be permitted
<Sync time="198.605"/>
to maximize personal freedom .
<Sync time="200.320"/>

<Sync time="201.420"/>
our third argument is that bans on polygamy are unenforceable .
<Sync time="204.520"/>

<Sync time="204.800"/>
why is this true ?
<Sync time="206.640"/>
so in a country like the u_s , where it has strict laws against polygamy and has had them for
<Sync time="211.460"/>
over a hundred years ,
<Sync time="212.820"/>
we see that there's still no way to stop
<Sync time="214.530"/>
people from living
<Sync time="215.140"/>
in a polygamous fashion .
<Sync time="216.730"/>
lots of people never go down to city hall to get a marriage certificate
<Sync time="220.150"/>
or whatever you may do in other countries ,
<Sync time="222.195"/>
they just choose to live as husband and wife ,
<Sync time="224.550"/>
treat each other like such . we see that marriage is predominantly
<Sync time="227.415"/>
a social and religious phenomenon ,
<Sync time="229.365"/>
and not a government
<Sync time="230.500"/>
one .
<Sync time="230.700"/>
at that point , you can't stop people from having polygamous marriages
<Sync time="234.395"/>
in a religious or social setting ,
<Sync time="236.410"/>
so there's ultimately
<Sync time="237.380"/>
no reason to ban it from a legal perspective , because you can't prevent
<Sync time="240.700"/>
the actions in themselves , only the state recognition of those actions .
<Sync time="244.540"/>
so at the end of the day , we think we should legalize polygamy
<Sync time="247.080"/>
in order to end religious discrimination ,
<Sync time="249.375"/>
because it's a victimless crime , and because the law is unenforceable .
<Sync time="252.710"/>
thank you .
