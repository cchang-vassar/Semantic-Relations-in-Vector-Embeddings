we should not abolish the u_s electoral college .
<Sync time="4.090"/>
so , while
<Sync time="5.340"/>
people may be with an uproar given that the
<Sync time="8.175"/>
two of the last five presidential elections resulted
<Sync time="11.450"/>
in a result in which the popular vote winner
<Sync time="14.060"/>
did not win the electoral college and therefore , did not become president of the united states ,
<Sync time="18.770"/>
we think that it's important to take a step back
<Sync time="20.700"/>
and recognize that
<Sync time="21.675"/>
there's no correct way for the u_s democracy to function .
<Sync time="25.670"/>
majoritarianism
<Sync time="26.840"/>
isn't necessarily the best way for the government to
<Sync time="29.785"/>
to function , for the best way for people to make decisions and in fact ,
<Sync time="33.330"/>
majoritarianism has historically been a way in which
<Sync time="36.250"/>
marginalized groups have been oppressed , in which
<Sync time="38.500"/>
tons of violence and state violence has occurred against marginalized groups , and we think that
<Sync time="43.150"/>
there is no correct way for the democratic system to work . and there's no system that's going to be entirely democratic , because
<Sync time="49.525"/>
it's always necessarily going to be the case that some voices are marginalized and some voices are ignored .
<Sync time="55.140"/>
we think you need to do is the united states government
<Sync time="57.715"/>
is present an option
<Sync time="59.035"/>
in which
<Sync time="59.590"/>
the country , as a whole , is as represented by the election results
<Sync time="64.030"/>
as pop- as possible .
<Sync time="65.620"/>
we think the popular vote
<Sync time="67.120"/>
leads to can- uh leads to control
<Sync time="69.330"/>
simply by urban areas , at the expense of rural areas . we think that
<Sync time="73.370"/>
what you would end up seeing is an a
<Sync time="74.940"/>
a presidential election in which
<Sync time="76.885"/>
candidates
<Sync time="77.905"/>
only spend their time in
<Sync time="79.400"/>
urban areas , they only spend their time in cities , and
<Sync time="82.095"/>
people in rural areas are never going to be able to have their voices heard .
<Sync time="85.400"/>
we think that that's simply not fair .
<Sync time="87.260"/>
we think that
<Sync time="88.070"/>
all american individuals should be valued equally by the president .
<Sync time="91.580"/>
we think
<Sync time="92.155"/>
that is the only government official
<Sync time="94.325"/>
that exist to represent the
<Sync time="96.185"/>
government or the the country
<Sync time="98.170"/>
as a whole .
<Sync time="99.110"/>
we think that that person should be forced to recognize the
<Sync time="101.665"/>
the issues
<Sync time="102.395"/>
of rural and urban , of
<Sync time="104.505"/>
coastal states and of
<Sync time="105.960"/>
internal states of all of these groups ,
<Sync time="108.370"/>
and we think that the u_s electoral college
<Sync time="110.880"/>
best does
<Sync time="111.925"/>
or best insures that that's the case . so ,
<Sync time="114.190"/>
we have a few reasons why we think the electoral college is good . the first is that
<Sync time="117.940"/>
it corrects for a lack
<Sync time="119.405"/>
of big state control of the senate by giving more weight to those big states . what this means is that
<Sync time="124.375"/>
the electoral college insures that big states are given
<Sync time="127.145"/>
a greater weight
<Sync time="128.260"/>
even though in the senate ,
<Sync time="129.750"/>
those states
<Sync time="130.595"/>
are given the same weight as everyone else . so it's a balancing factor . it's a system of the checks and balances that were created
<Sync time="136.280"/>
internally to the u_s government .
<Sync time="138.440"/>
it'll
<Sync time="138.790"/>
it ensures that those big states get greater representation in a way
<Sync time="142.275"/>
that they otherwise don't in the senate ,
<Sync time="144.050"/>
which means that in the highest office ,
<Sync time="145.990"/>
those states
<Sync time="146.735"/>
are balanced out by the fact that in the senate ,
<Sync time="149.040"/>
they don't get as much of a voice
<Sync time="150.320"/>
as many think they should .
<Sync time="152.210"/>
furthermore ,
<Sync time="152.920"/>
it allows for swing states to get uh
<Sync time="155.225"/>
to put issues on the table that otherwise never would've been able to .
<Sync time="158.600"/>
so we think that ,
<Sync time="159.555"/>
for example , ohio , in an election which only
<Sync time="162.950"/>
the popular votes matter ,
<Sync time="164.470"/>
is not going to be a state that gets
<Sync time="166.115"/>
very much attention , but every four years , it gets a ton of attention through the u_s electoral college because it's a swing state . what this means is that
<Sync time="173.295"/>
these interior rust belt states , these states ,
<Sync time="176.035"/>
such as ohio
<Sync time="177.285"/>
and indiana and virginia ,
<Sync time="179.230"/>
states that otherwise wouldn't get a lot of attention because they don't have big urban centers ,
<Sync time="183.650"/>
get attention , and it
<Sync time="184.800"/>
ensures that those issues
<Sync time="186.335"/>
get to the national stage . it means that people that are otherwise
<Sync time="189.350"/>
largely ignored by the political elite
<Sync time="191.655"/>
get their voices heard , and we think that's crucial , especially in a time
<Sync time="194.870"/>
where political elitism
<Sync time="196.340"/>
is running at a higher level than ever .
<Sync time="198.530"/>
finally , we think it insures
<Sync time="200.160"/>
transregional appeal of the president . as i said ,
<Sync time="203.320"/>
the presidential office is the only office in u_s government
<Sync time="206.450"/>
that is
<Sync time="207.090"/>
elected by the whole country .
<Sync time="209.040"/>
what this means is that that person needs to have appeals ,
<Sync time="211.735"/>
not just to california and new york and the urban elites that live in those coastal areas ,
<Sync time="216.260"/>
but to all people .
<Sync time="217.430"/>
the governmen- the president of the united states is the president of new york and the president of iowa and the president of montana
<Sync time="223.200"/>
and as such ,
<Sync time="224.140"/>
even if they don't win the electoral college in every single state ,
<Sync time="227.590"/>
you're more likely to result with a president
<Sync time="229.560"/>
that has a transregional
<Sync time="231.190"/>
appeal than you otherwise would if you simply allowed
<Sync time="234.130"/>
for the popular vote ,
<Sync time="235.355"/>
to ensure that seventy percent of californians and seventy percent of new yorkers
<Sync time="239.325"/>
end up deciding who's going to be president of the united states . that's not fair to those
<Sync time="244.030"/>
inside of the country , that's not fair to the vast majority of americans and for this reason ,
<Sync time="248.460"/>
we should not abolish the u_s electoral college .
<Sync time="251.230"/>
