<Sync time="1.925"/>
i'm proud to stand in proposition of today's motion
<Sync time="4.395"/>
that we should
<Sync time="5.135"/>
ban uh that we should legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="8.210"/>
i think the model for this is pretty intuitive , right ? just like a government should just recognize same sex unions and that you just change the definition of marriage from a man and a woman
<Sync time="16.170"/>
to just to individuals who consent into the marriage .
<Sync time="19.780"/>
three independent points under this :
<Sync time="21.270"/>
first , that autonomy is something we should respect including for gay people ,
<Sync time="24.800"/>
secondly 
<Sync time="25.525"/>
that bans on gay marriage increase instances of homophobia ,
<Sync time="28.615"/>
and thirdly that there ought be a sep- separation of church and state
<Sync time="31.350"/>
and in so far as the opposition to gay marriage is largely religiously based ,
<Sync time="35.070"/>
we should recognize that like this is a
<Sync time="36.935"/>
poor reason to oppose gay marriage .
<Sync time="38.980"/>
so , first on autonomy .
<Sync time="40.860"/>
i think it's worth recognizing that autonomy is a good thing .
<Sync time="43.180"/>
it is the most fundamental right that we have .
<Sync time="45.370"/>
the reason why we care about life is that we can do things and not like condemned into slavery , right ? the reason that we
<Sync time="50.245"/>
care about our health is because that enables us to actually d- have decisions o- like the ability to do the things that we want to do .
<Sync time="56.580"/>
autonomy to the maximum extent is always going to be good in a vacuum .
<Sync time="60.190"/>
when the government is justified in infringing on autonomy ?
<Sync time="62.540"/>
it's because that autonomy comes into conflict with someone else's autonomy . so like murder for example is banned
<Sync time="68.190"/>
because we recognize that when one person kills another person , that limits the person who is killed's autonomy to a very 
<Sync time="74.435"/>
large extent .
<Sync time="75.620"/>
so ,
<Sync time="76.240"/>
we look at these two things that we say :
<Sync time="78.225"/>
" oh okay well you know , your right to kill someone is a lot less important than your 
<Sync time="83.055"/>
like
<Sync time="83.770"/>
right to just be alive . "
<Sync time="85.400"/>
so we restrict the thing that restricts the other person's autonomy .
<Sync time="89.220"/>
so ,
<Sync time="89.655"/>
there has to be an externality to an action . a way in which somebody else suffers or s- has their autonomy limited
<Sync time="95.305"/>
as a result of your actions in order to for a ban to be justified .
<Sync time="98.980"/>
the problem is that gay marriage doesn't have externalities .
<Sync time="102.180"/>
people aren't affected by this , right ?
<Sync time="104.240"/>
like if i engage in a union with another man ,
<Sync time="107.080"/>
someone standing down the street or someone else in society isn't affected by that union in a meaningful way .
<Sync time="112.935"/>
and even if they are like
<Sync time="114.130"/>
peeved by it , or they find themselves made slightly uncomfortable ,
<Sync time="117.530"/>
we think that is a much less significant harm
<Sync time="119.925"/>
tan the harms that will be enacted upon myself and my partner
<Sync time="123.110"/>
by not being able to engage in a lawful union .
<Sync time="125.410"/>
that leads me into my second independent point that instances of homophobia and harms upon gay individuals
<Sync time="130.550"/>
are magnified by a ban .
<Sync time="132.540"/>
this is true for three reasons :
<Sync time="134.400"/>
so ,
<Sync time="135.205"/>
%hes broadly that it normalizes homophobia . that it normalizes the idea that being gay is like the other and is not acceptable within mainstream society . so three harms to that :
<Sync time="144.960"/>
first it increases instances of assault and discrimination
<Sync time="147.940"/>
because it normalizes the idea that gay people or the other and that you can treat them like the other .
<Sync time="151.980"/>
that you can engage in housing discrimination or that you can assault on the street ,
<Sync time="155.290"/>
things like that .
<Sync time="156.280"/>
so when you
<Sync time="157.185"/>
take down the veil , when you say : " no , it is okay for these people to enter into legal union "
<Sync time="161.740"/>
you take down the legal basis or
<Sync time="164.455"/>
at least the societally justified basis
<Sync time="167.140"/>
for why it is okay to discriminate against gay people .
<Sync time="169.760"/>
second is it creates identity crisis of most like-
<Sync time="171.990"/>
especially young gay people that they think that
<Sync time="174.135"/>
this thing that they experience , that is completely natural ,
<Sync time="176.920"/>
completely acceptable and doesn't affect other people's lives in another way ,
<Sync time="180.150"/>
isn't okay
<Sync time="181.030"/>
because society has told them it's not ok , because there are these legal signals that their identity is wrong .
<Sync time="185.870"/>
so recognize then , that that is a harm . there is massive psychological trauma associated with that . that is why like
<Sync time="191.450"/>
suicide amongst gay teens is so massively massively high .
<Sync time="195.170"/>
thirdly , when you push people onto the fringe of society ,
<Sync time="198.140"/>
there are harms intrinsic to that . so like , for example , how like
<Sync time="201.340"/>
a lot of gay people used to have to be prostitutes . like in the , you know , the
<Sync time="205.000"/>
eighties and even today to a large extent ,
<Sync time="207.495"/>
because they are put to the fringes of society and are told :
<Sync time="210.405"/>
" you are not good enough to be within like a normal context of society and
<Sync time="213.930"/>
act as %hes a normal member of our society " .
<Sync time="216.540"/>
so ,
<Sync time="217.335"/>
the third independent point i'd like to advance is the separation of church and state and why that's an intrinsically good thing . like recognize that the opposition to gay marriages largely religiously based , that there's like some textual arguments about this from like christianity particularly ,
<Sync time="227.810"/>
but it's important to note that the state shouldn't be involved with in-
<Sync time="230.820"/>
like shouldn't make policy decisions on a religious basis . that it shouldn't favor particular religions or even
<Sync time="235.360"/>
religiosity in general when compared to secularism
<Sync time="238.100"/>
because that necessarily favors one group in society
<Sync time="240.610"/>
over another .
<Sync time="241.590"/>
it's for this reason ,
<Sync time="242.610"/>
these reasons rather ,
<Sync time="243.755"/>
that
<Sync time="244.160"/>
it's uh important to recognize that the opposition to this policy is
<Sync time="247.435"/>
fairly
<Sync time="248.785"/>
ridiculous . proud to propose .
<Sync time="251.785"/>
