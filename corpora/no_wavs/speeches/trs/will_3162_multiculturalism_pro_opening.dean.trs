i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt
<Sync time="3.590"/>
multiculturalism .
<Sync time="5.420"/>
so
<Sync time="5.890"/>
two points really , but first just like a little quick model %hes
<Sync time="9.080"/>
explanation i guess
<Sync time="10.250"/>
is that what we mean by adopting multiculturalism is
<Sync time="14.310"/>
really embracing a society where
<Sync time="17.035"/>
multiple cultural backgrounds coexist .
<Sync time="20.230"/>
so this is something less like a nation-state and more like you know
<Sync time="24.730"/>
countries where
<Sync time="26.130"/>
there is um
<Sync time="26.970"/>
you know a wide variety of uh
<Sync time="29.580"/>
cultures represented .
<Sync time="31.295"/>
um
<Sync time="32.470"/>
we're obviously not going to %hes that they're you know represented equally but
<Sync time="35.900"/>
we do want to embrace a society that attempts uh to integrate rather than segregate essentially .
<Sync time="42.660"/>
so two independent points .
<Sync time="44.590"/>
the first being that you know that
<Sync time="46.980"/>
integration
<Sync time="48.080"/>
um
<Sync time="48.810"/>
basically leads to more contact amongst cultures and increases tolerance for others . so
<Sync time="54.640"/>
we think that in a world without multiculturalism , that is one where there is sort of segregation based on cultural values and norms ,
<Sync time="61.830"/>
um where you know
<Sync time="63.115"/>
sort of like different groups and enclaves have different
<Sync time="66.285"/>
physical territories and that they don't really intermingle very much .
<Sync time="70.055"/>

<Sync time="70.570"/>
there's a lot of intrinsic harms um
<Sync time="73.510"/>
generally for the ones that for whatever culture is in the minority .
<Sync time="76.830"/>
um the first is just outright discrimination
<Sync time="79.150"/>
um
<Sync time="79.770"/>
you know
<Sync time="80.515"/>
talking about housing policies , talking about um you know education policies
<Sync time="85.240"/>
that
<Sync time="85.840"/>
um
<Sync time="86.530"/>
you just have like active discrimination against this group because they don't have the political capital and uh
<Sync time="92.530"/>
numbers to really represent themselves properly
<Sync time="95.190"/>
within the system .
<Sync time="96.790"/>
second is violence . um
<Sync time="98.270"/>
you know just
<Sync time="98.910"/>
just outright violence against uh members of an oppressed community . this is
<Sync time="103.270"/>
i think a good example of this islamophobia in the united states where
<Sync time="106.745"/>
people who just legitimately do not understand the culture that a lot of uh people of middle eastern descent come from
<Sync time="113.670"/>
um
<Sync time="114.040"/>
%hes translates into widespread violence and acts of hate
<Sync time="117.760"/>
outright hatred against these people
<Sync time="120.100"/>
um and that largely stems from just a lack of understanding from a
<Sync time="123.720"/>
lack of co-mingling that um
<Sync time="126.280"/>
that allows the worst stereotypes of the minority group
<Sync time="130.095"/>
to
<Sync time="130.890"/>
take root in the minds of the majority
<Sync time="133.520"/>
and um becomes the character by which all all people of middle eastern descent
<Sync time="138.190"/>
are analyzed .
<Sync time="140.110"/>
lastly though is just segregation .
<Sync time="142.200"/>
um
<Sync time="143.045"/>
and we think that
<Sync time="144.430"/>
broadly speaking
<Sync time="145.970"/>
segregation
<Sync time="147.130"/>
um you know sort of the separate but equal line of thinking doesn't actually play out .
<Sync time="150.820"/>
what widely happens with segregation is a minority population is put into um
<Sync time="156.940"/>
is put into a living situation that is deeply inadequate when compared to the one that the majority has .
<Sync time="162.320"/>
%hes a good example of this is um that african-americans in the united states are
<Sync time="166.350"/>
largely relegated to um impoverished , resource poor
<Sync time="170.230"/>
uh inner-city areas
<Sync time="172.270"/>
um
<Sync time="172.840"/>
where they are deprived of educational and financial opportunities .
<Sync time="176.590"/>
oum this of course then leads to sort of cyclical poverty
<Sync time="180.030"/>
where
<Sync time="180.585"/>
it is difficult for people to escape these harms of their own merit and their own volition
<Sync time="185.210"/>
because they are starting at a position that is
<Sync time="187.630"/>
relatively worse than those of people who enjoy power and privilege .
<Sync time="192.100"/>
given that then we think that multiculturalism can help solve for this by
<Sync time="196.000"/>
making people much more comfortable with uh like sharing quarters with
<Sync time="199.930"/>
people that come from different backgrounds , that have different culture
<Sync time="203.415"/>
and um
<Sync time="204.425"/>
by sharing those faces then you facilitate more upward mobility , you facilitate more
<Sync time="209.260"/>
thorough integration
<Sync time="210.565"/>
and you don't have this level of segregation where people are
<Sync time="213.775"/>
relegated off .
<Sync time="215.460"/>
second and just very quickly is that i think you get a better culture when you have multiculturalism .
<Sync time="220.880"/>
a lot of the time cultures can become dominated by
<Sync time="223.640"/>
unchecked beliefs that
<Sync time="225.145"/>
without some sort of outside perspective
<Sync time="227.490"/>
often goes unchallenged .
<Sync time="229.320"/>
um i think a lot of the times when people talk about the worst elements of a specific culture
<Sync time="233.555"/>
like things pertaining to uh you know discrimination against women for example in more conservative cultures
<Sync time="238.980"/>
that's largely a product of a lack of interaction
<Sync time="241.435"/>
with other more modern
<Sync time="242.890"/>
and more accepting cultures .
<Sync time="244.840"/>
so when you have this multicultural environment where there is that constant
<Sync time="248.600"/>
uh
<Sync time="249.195"/>
you know dialogue between cultures , i think you're
<Sync time="251.945"/>
quite likely then to take the best of both worlds and run with that . proud to propose .
<Sync time="256.580"/>
