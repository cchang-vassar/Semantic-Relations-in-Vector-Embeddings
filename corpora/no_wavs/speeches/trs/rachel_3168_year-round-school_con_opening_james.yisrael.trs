<Sync time="0.915"/>
school is perfectly fine the way it is now
<Sync time="4.170"/>
with students coming in for the majority of the winter year
<Sync time="7.685"/>
like fall and winter and parts of spring
<Sync time="10.055"/>
and then having a break
<Sync time="11.700"/>
over the course of summer during which they can recuperate .
<Sync time="14.475"/>
two areas of clash
<Sync time="15.960"/>
first on the needs of children .
<Sync time="18.170"/>
it is better for the learning of children if they are given time off during the summer
<Sync time="22.250"/>
rather than first
<Sync time="23.350"/>
forced to attend school throughout the entire year .
<Sync time="26.400"/>
this is because when students are forced
<Sync time="28.695"/>
to come in repetitively day after day after day
<Sync time="31.770"/>
even if you have short breaks in between
<Sync time="33.860"/>
it's still not enough to truly shake off
<Sync time="36.230"/>
that feeling of being back in school
<Sync time="38.440"/>
and completely relax before coming back in .
<Sync time="41.250"/>
sure they forget some things
<Sync time="43.325"/>
but this is better than the opposite world
<Sync time="45.530"/>
in which maybe they're taught more
<Sync time="47.620"/>
but they don't actually ending up learning more because they're much more likely to get bored ,
<Sync time="51.700"/>
stop paying attention ,
<Sync time="53.300"/>
and
<Sync time="54.020"/>
when they don't have summer to recuperate
<Sync time="56.320"/>
they also stop being able to
<Sync time="58.060"/>
intake all of that information at the same rates because they are so tired of it .
<Sync time="62.330"/>
maintaining this kind of rigorous schedule
<Sync time="64.620"/>
takes a lot of energy out of students .
<Sync time="66.915"/>
being able to take the summer and sort of
<Sync time="69.615"/>
distance yourself from that lifestyle
<Sync time="72.210"/>
allows students to come back to the
<Sync time="74.105"/>
at the beginning of the year
<Sync time="75.610"/>
full of energy
<Sync time="76.690"/>
and capable of learning all of that information
<Sync time="79.250"/>
to the fullest extent .
<Sync time="81.180"/>
b- also we think that it is better
<Sync time="83.910"/>
in terms of family time
<Sync time="85.595"/>
when
<Sync time="86.265"/>
children are not going to school over the summer .
<Sync time="89.050"/>
because with school in session
<Sync time="90.540"/>
you come home . you do your homework .
<Sync time="92.420"/>
and
<Sync time="92.805"/>
even if your parents are home from work and they're around you during that time 
<Sync time="96.450"/>
you're often more stressed .
<Sync time="97.980"/>
and because you are busy with other things you actually get less quality time with your parents .
<Sync time="102.860"/>
more than this we think that
<Sync time="104.290"/>
weather actually matters in these situations .
<Sync time="107.630"/>
so
<Sync time="108.095"/>
being able to
<Sync time="109.370"/>
ha- a schedule of education under the summer
<Sync time="111.730"/>
for a longer period of time
<Sync time="113.910"/>
rather than only having short breaks
<Sync time="116.310"/>
in which you might have
<Sync time="117.590"/>
uh like in
<Sync time="118.480"/>
in which a lot of the time the weather might not be as pleasant
<Sync time="121.840"/>
and you
<Sync time="122.130"/>
and the kinds of activities you can do during these breaks
<Sync time="124.845"/>
are actually incredibly limited .
<Sync time="126.860"/>
our second area of clash
<Sync time="128.880"/>
has to do with why we think that it is better
<Sync time="130.905"/>
in the long term in terms of life experience first ones to have summer off .
<Sync time="135.310"/>
because recognize that life after you exit school
<Sync time="138.355"/>
isn't based on classes and the kind of schedule that is held them around it .
<Sync time="142.450"/>
rather it is going to be much more similar
<Sync time="144.615"/>
to what high schoolers or
<Sync time="146.295"/>
oftentimes once you get into college and how you spend your summers
<Sync time="149.565"/>
what those summers look like .
<Sync time="151.780"/>
because
<Sync time="152.630"/>
when it is during the summer when you actually have time to hold down a nine to five job to do an internship .
<Sync time="159.090"/>
so in the situations of high school students
<Sync time="161.320"/>
it's the only time in which they get to experience what the rest of their life is going to look like
<Sync time="165.830"/>
rather than just what these current four years of their life
<Sync time="169.430"/>
are going to look like .
<Sync time="170.925"/>
this also applies in situations of resume building
<Sync time="173.925"/>
we think that
<Sync time="174.745"/>
a lot of the time the only time that high schoolers have to maintain rigorous internships and take advantage of strong opportunities
<Sync time="181.540"/>
is during the summer when they have swaths of large amounts of time .
<Sync time="184.930"/>
otherwise 
<Sync time="185.700"/>
large amounts of resources are required
<Sync time="187.905"/>
in order to put them in situations during the school year
<Sync time="190.630"/>
where they can
<Sync time="191.110"/>
allocate that time to these research opportunities
<Sync time="193.680"/>
or resume building opportunities .
<Sync time="195.725"/>
if we want to talk about low income students
<Sync time="197.935"/>
this is especially important there
<Sync time="200.220"/>
because while for rich students
<Sync time="202.475"/>
parents might be able to pay administrations of colleges and get them in either way
<Sync time="207.100"/>
for low income students
<Sync time="208.290"/>
if you don't have things to pad your resume
<Sync time="210.620"/>
schools have much less of an incentive to take you in
<Sync time="213.260"/>
because you don't provide an economic incentive for them .
<Sync time="216.035"/>
so
<Sync time="216.945"/>
for those reasons we think that it is actually better for low income students
<Sync time="220.350"/>
if they can build their resume during that time .
<Sync time="222.680"/>
but even if they don't want to go to college
<Sync time="224.700"/>
we think that the only time in which you can make
<Sync time="227.220"/>
a large sum of money
<Sync time="228.630"/>
through the c-
<Sync time="229.230"/>
that can last you into the year
<Sync time="230.950"/>
is over the summer when you can work
<Sync time="232.665"/>
much longer hours than during the school year .
<Sync time="235.450"/>
weaving on their side of the house 
<Sync time="237.170"/>
students on net
<Sync time="238.440"/>
get less time in which they can stockpile funds that can last them to the school year when they might be able to work a lot less or not lot- all at all because they need to focus on studies
<Sync time="247.280"/>
for these reasons proud to oppose .
