we should introduce year round schooling .
<Sync time="3.320"/>
we think
<Sync time="3.850"/>
that when it comes to education debates the focus of the debate should always be
<Sync time="8.015"/>
on what is most likely to result
<Sync time="10.170"/>
in good education for children ,
<Sync time="12.390"/>
what is likely to lead to a more informed populace
<Sync time="15.290"/>
in the future ,
<Sync time="16.380"/>
and what is most likely to be effective in actually achieving the goals
<Sync time="19.885"/>
of educating .
<Sync time="20.910"/>
so the model for this we think is pretty clear .
<Sync time="23.640"/>
we think that instead of having summer vacation ,
<Sync time="25.920"/>
we would have school
<Sync time="27.570"/>
all acro-
<Sync time="28.710"/>
uh for the entire year . we think that
<Sync time="30.810"/>
you're likely to increase we would probably increase the amount of school days that people have
<Sync time="35.320"/>
but we would also increase the amount of breaks
<Sync time="37.485"/>
that exist uh
<Sync time="38.570"/>
during the school year . so
<Sync time="40.055"/>
in the status quo in much of the united states there are like
<Sync time="42.875"/>
two large breaks
<Sync time="44.500"/>
during the school year . one for the spring , and one for the winter .
<Sync time="47.810"/>
we would increase
<Sync time="49.790"/>
these types of one week breaks
<Sync time="51.755"/>
but we would get rid of the three month layoff that exists
<Sync time="54.840"/>
during the summer .
<Sync time="56.080"/>
alright so
<Sync time="56.980"/>
why do we think that this is so crucial ? so the status quo
<Sync time="60.020"/>
has some very clear
<Sync time="61.320"/>
flaws .
<Sync time="61.970"/>
when we're talking about education ,
<Sync time="63.370"/>
when you're talking about
<Sync time="64.580"/>
allowing people to really internalize what they're being taught in a classroom ,
<Sync time="68.555"/>
we think that a three month gap
<Sync time="71.230"/>
every single year between class
<Sync time="73.730"/>
ending and class beginning
<Sync time="75.305"/>
is one that is likely going to result in the deterioration of skill .
<Sync time="78.980"/>
this is why in many schools
<Sync time="81.125"/>
the first month ,
<Sync time="82.255"/>
or the first few weeks of class ,
<Sync time="84.470"/>
result in people
<Sync time="85.640"/>
relearning what they learned in the past year .
<Sync time="87.340"/>
for example if you're going from
<Sync time="89.375"/>
algebra to geometry in high school ,
<Sync time="92.305"/>
the first month of geometry may be composed of
<Sync time="95.045"/>
relearning the things that you learned the year before in algebra and the reason for this is that
<Sync time="99.100"/>
teachers and students alike both know
<Sync time="101.510"/>
that people simply forget the things that they've learned the year before .
<Sync time="105.160"/>
once people pass the test and move on
<Sync time="108.030"/>
move o- move on with their life start , enjoying their summer ,
<Sync time="110.730"/>
they're unlikely to actually remember the things
<Sync time="113.250"/>
that they learned in that class which means that
<Sync time="115.335"/>
school itself becomes a repetitive practice
<Sync time="117.645"/>
and it's also a massive time waste
<Sync time="119.655"/>
that otherwise could be used
<Sync time="121.115"/>
for teaching other subjects for continuing education . but more importantly ,
<Sync time="124.880"/>
we don't think there's any sort of consistency
<Sync time="126.970"/>
to this type of education in the status quo .
<Sync time="129.770"/>
we think the way that people are most likely to learn to most likely internalize knowledge
<Sync time="134.235"/>
is to get a consistent
<Sync time="135.900"/>
learning pattern develop ,
<Sync time="137.850"/>
to have some sort of study methods that they're able to consistently applied throughout the year
<Sync time="142.870"/>
but having hiatuses such as summer vacation ,
<Sync time="145.870"/>
don't allow for these consistent patterns of education to emerge
<Sync time="149.515"/>
and we think that this leads to bad education happens-
<Sync time="152.080"/>
habits and it leads to people
<Sync time="153.930"/>
always counting down to summer vacation . when people always have this one long break to look forward to
<Sync time="159.200"/>
they tend to turn off especially in the latter half of the school year
<Sync time="162.550"/>
when they know it's coming close . if you don't have these types of things we think you have more consistent patterns
<Sync time="167.440"/>
and what we've seen is success abroad
<Sync time="169.960"/>
where people have
<Sync time="171.010"/>
had these types of year round schooling . in nations that do have this type of schooling ,
<Sync time="174.895"/>
their test scores tend to be higher than the test scores
<Sync time="177.830"/>
in places like the united states and other areas
<Sync time="180.320"/>
in which they have this very long lay off
<Sync time="182.990"/>
in the middle of the summer
<Sync time="184.355"/>
and we think that uh we think that
<Sync time="186.550"/>
arguments that go against this
<Sync time="188.170"/>
often involve the idea of
<Sync time="190.100"/>
children wanting to be able to take the time off . that there's this expectation that parents want to take their children on vacation and do this and that .
<Sync time="197.940"/>
but recognized
<Sync time="198.760"/>
if you give breaks during the year these types of things can still be done . children can still get time
<Sync time="203.660"/>
to take their breaks
<Sync time="205.070"/>
but you actually also can spread the
<Sync time="207.520"/>
spread the lessons , spread the tasks out
<Sync time="210.135"/>
over a longer period of time
<Sync time="212.160"/>
which means that we think that students while they're in school ,
<Sync time="214.820"/>
are less likely to have the same levels of stress , the same levels of anxiety ,
<Sync time="218.600"/>
and the same pressure upon them
<Sync time="220.175"/>
as they would when the school year shortened and
<Sync time="223.075"/>
teachers are forced to cram entire
<Sync time="225.610"/>
entire courses
<Sync time="226.900"/>
into a shorter period of time uh
<Sync time="229.280"/>
into a shorter period of time
<Sync time="230.920"/>
and trying to get it all in before they lose the attention of their students who are always looking on
<Sync time="235.330"/>
to the prospect of summer .
<Sync time="236.975"/>
we think that year round schooling
<Sync time="238.645"/>
has been shown in past instances
<Sync time="240.900"/>
to be successful . it is shown
<Sync time="242.830"/>
to allow for better education patterns , and habits to form in students
<Sync time="246.915"/>
and we think
<Sync time="247.805"/>
that simply sticking to the old way of doing things because people are comfortable with it is never sufficient excuse .
<Sync time="254.345"/>
we think that year round schooling is likely to result
<Sync time="256.760"/>
in more educated students , in a more educated
<Sync time="259.575"/>
populace , and for this reason ,
<Sync time="261.465"/>
we should introduce year round schooling .
<Sync time="264.290"/>
