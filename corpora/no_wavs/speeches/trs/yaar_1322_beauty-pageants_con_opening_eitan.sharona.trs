ladies and gentlemen , we have an interesting opposition line for you today .
<Sync time="4.220"/>
let's see how this goes .
<Sync time="6.170"/>
we fully accept that there is a problem with beauty pageants in the status quo ,
<Sync time="10.870"/>
but unlike proposition , we do not think that the root of the problem lies with objectification
<Sync time="16.910"/>
itself ,
<Sync time="17.655"/>
but rather with the inequality or the
<Sync time="21.075"/>
disproportionality of that
<Sync time="23.020"/>
objectification
<Sync time="24.300"/>
and that is what we aim to fix .
<Sync time="26.670"/>
that's right ,
<Sync time="27.680"/>
rather than less female beauty pageants ,
<Sync time="30.600"/>
we offer more dominance to male beauty pageants and male objectification in general .
<Sync time="36.590"/>
we believe
<Sync time="37.625"/>
that true liberation for women
<Sync time="40.170"/>
means having them treated equally .
<Sync time="42.500"/>
for decades , we have tried to achieve that goal
<Sync time="45.570"/>
by
<Sync time="46.635"/>
changing
<Sync time="48.055"/>
our approach or the way that we treat women .
<Sync time="51.240"/>
this has worked partially
<Sync time="53.120"/>
and very slowly and unlike we would have wanted .
<Sync time="56.300"/>
perhaps it's time to change
<Sync time="58.725"/>
our approach and change the way that we treat men .
<Sync time="62.250"/>
specifically , we advocate in this debate that
<Sync time="64.640"/>
the already existing and rapidly growing phenomenon of things like
<Sync time="68.950"/>
chippendales ,
<Sync time="70.120"/>
backstreet boys ,
<Sync time="71.300"/>
one direction and justin bieber .
<Sync time="74.115"/>
now , here's something that i never thought that i would say .
<Sync time="77.960"/>
truly , our line is simple .
<Sync time="79.950"/>
we simply say that people are naturally
<Sync time="83.350"/>
attracted to beauty .
<Sync time="85.235"/>

<Sync time="85.930"/>
we are programmed to rate the other sex
<Sync time="88.970"/>
based on appearance .
<Sync time="90.570"/>
this is true to both men and women .
<Sync time="93.270"/>
the problem is that for centuries ,
<Sync time="95.680"/>
male dominance has led
<Sync time="98.150"/>
our society to a situation in which it is no longer socially acceptable for women
<Sync time="103.625"/>
to publicly
<Sync time="104.970"/>
rate
<Sync time="105.610"/>
men on their appearance ,
<Sync time="107.400"/>
whereas to men , this is still considered okay .
<Sync time="110.760"/>
in this point , we are required to choose between
<Sync time="115.170"/>
waging war against human nature ,
<Sync time="118.060"/>
one that we
<Sync time="118.910"/>
that would be basically impossible for us to win
<Sync time="122.170"/>
because it's a war against our nature ,
<Sync time="124.440"/>
or harnessing our nature
<Sync time="126.810"/>
to obtain our
<Sync time="128.765"/>
%hes our purpose .
<Sync time="130.740"/>
why do we think that
<Sync time="132.755"/>
the second option is better ?
<Sync time="134.930"/>
because the true problem today is that
<Sync time="138.320"/>
%hes
<Sync time="138.895"/>
many men feel that they can
<Sync time="141.020"/>
appreciate women
<Sync time="142.200"/>
solely based on their appearance ,
<Sync time="144.645"/>
but in a world where men and women are being objectified left and right ,
<Sync time="150.250"/>
we say that men no longer have
<Sync time="152.600"/>
the privilege
<Sync time="154.065"/>
of their %hes
<Sync time="155.310"/>
like ,
<Sync time="156.070"/>
genders %hes
<Sync time="157.260"/>
that
<Sync time="157.955"/>
of their gender being considered superior .
<Sync time="160.750"/>
there is this perceived equality that trickles down to the minds
<Sync time="165.165"/>
of men and women alike .
<Sync time="167.960"/>
this is obviously a gradual situation , but we believe that in
<Sync time="171.430"/>
within a few generations , we will
<Sync time="174.250"/>
most definitely be there .
<Sync time="176.655"/>
as a result ,
<Sync time="178.265"/>
we think that society would have no choice but to change in such a way
<Sync time="182.660"/>
that no one is
<Sync time="184.335"/>
rated %hes no one is rating
<Sync time="186.850"/>
no one
<Sync time="187.570"/>
solely based on appearance , but
<Sync time="190.545"/>
based on
<Sync time="192.170"/>
also appearance alongside smarts and capabilities and every other thing that we would
<Sync time="197.640"/>
%hes would like people to be
<Sync time="199.460"/>
valued
<Sync time="200.395"/>
by .
<Sync time="201.105"/>
why ? why is this true ? because
<Sync time="203.025"/>
society needs those metrics
<Sync time="205.055"/>
and it will never
<Sync time="206.110"/>
allow a situation where everyone
<Sync time="208.790"/>
are being rated
<Sync time="210.105"/>
and ranked solely based on appearance .
<Sync time="212.980"/>
so , at the point in which there is no longer
<Sync time="215.440"/>
one sex that we can objectify
<Sync time="217.585"/>
and another sex that's being
<Sync time="219.600"/>
um that's being valued by
<Sync time="222.235"/>
other parameters , we say that everyone
<Sync time="225.170"/>
is gonna be judged by
<Sync time="227.405"/>
all of the parameters .
<Sync time="229.830"/>
so ,
<Sync time="230.415"/>
if you guys ever want to truly achieve
<Sync time="233.010"/>
real equality for women ,
<Sync time="235.050"/>
you have to oppose
<Sync time="236.425"/>
this motion .
<Sync time="238.399"/>
