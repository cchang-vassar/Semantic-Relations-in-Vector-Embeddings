we should abolish the monarchy .
<Sync time="2.320"/>
before we begin ,
<Sync time="3.460"/>
we need to clarify something because there are some different models and types of monarchies in the world ,
<Sync time="8.460"/>
starting from models where the monarch is
<Sync time="10.640"/>
the
<Sync time="10.950"/>
de facto ruler with absolute authority on political decisions made , like in saudi arabia or qatar ,
<Sync time="16.885"/>
to models where the monarch is a more diplomatic
<Sync time="19.560"/>
and symbolic figure
<Sync time="20.770"/>
with hardly any authority
<Sync time="22.455"/>
when it comes to policy , like in great britain .
<Sync time="24.880"/>
for the purposes of this debate , we will argue that all these models need to give way in favor of a democratic republic .
<Sync time="31.695"/>
of course ,
<Sync time="32.515"/>
the more authorities that the monarch has , the bigger our problem because
<Sync time="36.720"/>
becomes . we'll have two points . first ,
<Sync time="39.680"/>
i'll explain the rationale of why we had monarchies to begin with and why this rationale is no longer relevant
<Sync time="45.940"/>
today .
<Sync time="46.690"/>
and secondly ,
<Sync time="47.510"/>
i'll discuss the inherent harms in a monarchy under all models .
<Sync time="51.095"/>
so first point :
<Sync time="52.470"/>
monarchs
<Sync time="53.280"/>
all used to hold
<Sync time="54.580"/>
absolute authorities , and the legitimacy for their rule
<Sync time="57.720"/>
is that they were somehow able to persuade the people that they had some divine right to rule .
<Sync time="62.845"/>
the royal family were nearly godlike ,
<Sync time="65.320"/>
and that's why the title passes on
<Sync time="68.180"/>
in a hereditary fashion .
<Sync time="70.160"/>
now ,
<Sync time="70.625"/>
the rationale that justifies it was that we needed
<Sync time="73.985"/>
some one ruler above everyone else to dictate the rules so that we can have order
<Sync time="79.390"/>
and avoid anarchy .
<Sync time="81.220"/>
if there is no one that we can all agree that has the legitimate authority to set rules and enforce them ,
<Sync time="86.690"/>
then everyone do as they please , which is bad for everyone .
<Sync time="90.040"/>
therefore , it's best to sacrifice some of our liberties to this monarch
<Sync time="94.355"/>
and get a functioning society .
<Sync time="96.870"/>
but as time went by and people started becoming more aware of their own rights and demanding things from their kings ,
<Sync time="103.320"/>
the authorities of the monarchs dwindled down
<Sync time="106.220"/>
until we reach the current model of a democratic republic .
<Sync time="109.685"/>
and now , we obvious-
<Sync time="111.130"/>
obviously have plenty of examples to countries without a monarch that
<Sync time="114.550"/>
don't have anarchy in the streets .
<Sync time="116.790"/>
all that is needed is a functioning government , a
<Sync time="119.010"/>
parliament that sets laws
<Sync time="120.445"/>
and courts who enforce them .
<Sync time="122.700"/>
thus , the old logic and rational for monarchs is no longer valid
<Sync time="126.520"/>
today .
<Sync time="127.265"/>
the new rationale given sometimes , especially in britain ,
<Sync time="130.585"/>
is that
<Sync time="131.225"/>
this institution is ingrained in their tradition and culture of this country .
<Sync time="136.030"/>
and ,
<Sync time="136.570"/>
you know , all of this may be true ,
<Sync time="138.235"/>
but nostalgia and romanticism can only get you so far . this is exactly what museums are for .
<Sync time="144.260"/>
we're not saying that they should just forget all about
<Sync time="146.775"/>
their history ,
<Sync time="147.625"/>
but it's just like vikings are a very important part of the nordic countries' history
<Sync time="152.920"/>
and it it doesn't mean that they should go and ravage the seas today .
<Sync time="156.345"/>
we should put that behind us
<Sync time="158.230"/>
if no stronger rationale
<Sync time="159.850"/>
exists .
<Sync time="160.650"/>
a monarchy comes at very high
<Sync time="162.935"/>
costs , and we don't think that it's worth it
<Sync time="165.360"/>
just for nostalgia's sake .
<Sync time="167.120"/>
this brings me to my second point .
<Sync time="169.405"/>
along the years , there have been
<Sync time="171.300"/>
good kings and there have been bad kings .
<Sync time="173.660"/>
but the biggest problem is inherently that the people can't control what their king does ,
<Sync time="179.450"/>
except maybe for during violent revolutions when they try and overthrow the monarch .
<Sync time="184.190"/>
and this is , of course , something that we would like to prevent in the future , because many people tend to die in those .
<Sync time="189.405"/>
now ,
<Sync time="189.970"/>
because the title passes on through {heritance/heritage} ,
<Sync time="192.710"/>
the king needn't worry about his seat
<Sync time="195.340"/>
and can pretty much do as he pleases .
<Sync time="197.950"/>
in absolute monarchies , this is still true to this very day .
<Sync time="201.740"/>
on top of that , having grown up in a palace , even if the king wishes well ,
<Sync time="206.860"/>
most times he's just not really connected and fully aware
<Sync time="210.960"/>
of what
<Sync time="211.790"/>
the average citizen in his country needs .
<Sync time="214.500"/>
this is exactly what democratic republics are meant to fix .
<Sync time="218.125"/>
of course , there can also be good governments and bad governments ,
<Sync time="221.170"/>
but the head of state
<Sync time="222.260"/>
always knows
<Sync time="223.150"/>
that if he doesn't please the people , he will be removed , and this is the
<Sync time="226.745"/>
biggest check and balance on the power of the government . that's important .
<Sync time="231.015"/>
but
<Sync time="231.500"/>
even in constitutional monarchies , where the king is not a political figure per se , like the u_k ,
<Sync time="237.205"/>
there still is
<Sync time="238.345"/>
a huge price to pay for this monarchy .
<Sync time="241.330"/>
firstly , money . it costs a lot of money to maintain buckingham palace and the lavish lifestyle
<Sync time="246.350"/>
of the royal family .
<Sync time="247.740"/>
there also security costs , of course , and costs of expeditions abroad
<Sync time="251.790"/>
that all come from the taxpayers' payroll , taxpayers who did not choose this monarch ,
<Sync time="256.700"/>
not legitimate .
<Sync time="257.840"/>
moreover ,
<Sync time="258.700"/>
there's just something wrong about having a-class citizens in the form of royal families .
<Sync time="263.420"/>
this fixates the class system ,
<Sync time="265.420"/>
and ugly relic from less enlightened times .
<Sync time="268.065"/>
for all these reasons ,
<Sync time="269.570"/>
please propose .
<Sync time="270.743"/>
