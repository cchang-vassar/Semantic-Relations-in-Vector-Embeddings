i stand
<Sync time="1.740"/>
firm opposition to the motion :
<Sync time="3.650"/>
we should introduce covenant marriages .
<Sync time="6.705"/>
as an overview , i want to discuss what this motion is actually doing .
<Sync time="11.100"/>
because people can still have covenant marriages
<Sync time="14.145"/>
but they cannot be recognized by the government .
<Sync time="17.210"/>
it is unclear why two
<Sync time="19.290"/>
evangelical individuals
<Sync time="21.220"/>
need the government's
<Sync time="22.780"/>
accommodation to force them into these covenant marriages .
<Sync time="26.265"/>
if two people continue with their evangelical beliefs
<Sync time="29.665"/>
and truly believe that their marriage
<Sync time="31.320"/>
ought not be disrupted ,
<Sync time="32.890"/>
than they can simply not get a divorce .
<Sync time="35.450"/>
they can have a non binding agreement
<Sync time="37.385"/>
to have a covenant marriage .
<Sync time="39.550"/>
however when government steps in , it
<Sync time="41.590"/>
truly removes any option
<Sync time="43.650"/>
from harmed parties
<Sync time="44.850"/>
while also pushing government into religion and religion
<Sync time="48.240"/>
into government .
<Sync time="49.245"/>
it is terrible to set a precedent in which religious individuals
<Sync time="53.105"/>
can pass their traditions into law .
<Sync time="55.710"/>
this is the s- sort of reason why
<Sync time="58.500"/>
queer individuals , particularly
<Sync time="60.525"/>
in the united states ,
<Sync time="61.660"/>
were oppressed .
<Sync time="62.550"/>
evangelicals were able to put their belief into law
<Sync time="65.510"/>
and
<Sync time="66.155"/>
pass anti sodomy laws ,
<Sync time="68.150"/>
and then pass anti gay marriage laws ,
<Sync time="70.645"/>
which made it so queer individuals were oppressed by the state .
<Sync time="74.095"/>

<Sync time="75.630"/>
at this point 
<Sync time="76.690"/>
there is very little utility to be gained by the government
<Sync time="79.550"/>
recognizing the sort of marriage ,
<Sync time="81.260"/>
but very clear precedent for profound harm .
<Sync time="84.430"/>
additionally though , we have two more arguments to show why covenant marriages are bad .
<Sync time="90.090"/>
first off
<Sync time="90.800"/>
on future rights -
<Sync time="92.035"/>
it is unjust to sign away your future rights in such a drastic agreement .
<Sync time="96.505"/>
there are three conditions in which
<Sync time="98.865"/>
future rights can be signed away in a meaningful way :
<Sync time="102.110"/>
first ,
<Sync time="103.335"/>
that these future rights will come back after a particular expiration date that is not
<Sync time="108.310"/>
incredibly far off .
<Sync time="109.820"/>
covenant marriages are intended to last until death .
<Sync time="113.540"/>
the inability for these
<Sync time="115.585"/>
c- uh contracts
<Sync time="116.620"/>
to simply go away or expire
<Sync time="119.080"/>
means that these people have signed away their rights in perpetuity .
<Sync time="122.780"/>
it is unclear if they will hold the same religious belief
<Sync time="125.440"/>
or hold the same love that push them into the marriage ,
<Sync time="128.075"/>
and as such they are oppressing their future selves .
<Sync time="130.670"/>

<Sync time="131.260"/>
secondly though , unpredictability .
<Sync time="133.000"/>
there is literally no predictability when going into a marriage .
<Sync time="136.490"/>
people change when you live with them ,
<Sync time="138.240"/>
people change when you have a child with them ,
<Sync time="140.270"/>
people change when you've just spent enough time with them .
<Sync time="142.870"/>
it is impossible to predict what will happen after a marriage ,
<Sync time="145.800"/>
and as such there's not good predictability .
<Sync time="148.270"/>
when people sign contracts traditionally , it is with a great understanding and
<Sync time="152.380"/>
a huge amount of paperwor-
<Sync time="154.450"/>
work
<Sync time="154.820"/>
which allows the law to step in
<Sync time="157.170"/>
were certain conditions met . even
<Sync time="160.050"/>
if conditions were written into the covenant marriage which allows them to get out of it
<Sync time="164.390"/>
if they're say being abused ,
<Sync time="165.920"/>
these can always be hidden
<Sync time="166.970"/>
as i'll discuss my next argument .
<Sync time="169.380"/>
finally though ,
<Sync time="170.340"/>
the another way you can sign away your future rights is if there is profound utility from the
<Sync time="174.560"/>
having this contract in place .
<Sync time="176.250"/>
but as i already discussed ,
<Sync time="178.370"/>
individuals could have a covenant marriage between them but
<Sync time="181.330"/>
do not need the government to recognize it 
<Sync time="183.410"/>
and otherwise restrict the rights of one or both parties .
<Sync time="187.070"/>
at this point there is no reason why the government should step in and allow people to oppress themselves or oppress the-
<Sync time="193.030"/>
their spouses
<Sync time="194.320"/>
using a covenant marriage .
<Sync time="195.985"/>
the second argument i'd like to put forward though ,
<Sync time="198.375"/>
is that leverage is important in the sort of relationships .
<Sync time="201.510"/>
in abusive relationships ,
<Sync time="202.970"/>
divorce is an
<Sync time="204.055"/>
an incredibly important form of leverage
<Sync time="207.025"/>
to get a party out of that marriage .
<Sync time="209.760"/>
when individuals
<Sync time="210.960"/>
live in an abusive household , they live under a
<Sync time="214.010"/>
uh condition
<Sync time="214.940"/>
of profound stress which at times can be akin to torture .
<Sync time="218.490"/>
the government has an obligation not to torture
<Sync time="220.910"/>
enemy combatants ,
<Sync time="221.900"/>
so it very clearly has an obligation to its own citizens , to let them get out of torturous situations .
<Sync time="227.135"/>
very brief-
<Sync time="228.720"/>
briefly i'd like to address the point of children .
<Sync time="230.815"/>
because , while tim is right 
<Sync time="232.320"/>
that
<Sync time="232.625"/>
living in a household with a good marriage is preferable to living with divorced parents ,
<Sync time="236.820"/>
it is clearly preferable to live with divorced parents
<Sync time="239.095"/>
than a terrible marriage where people are shouting all the time
<Sync time="241.880"/>
and giving their children uh
<Sync time="243.190"/>
anxiety or other conditions .
<Sync time="245.330"/>
as such ,
<Sync time="246.370"/>
we oppose
<Sync time="247.380"/>
covenant marriages .
<Sync time="249.669"/>
