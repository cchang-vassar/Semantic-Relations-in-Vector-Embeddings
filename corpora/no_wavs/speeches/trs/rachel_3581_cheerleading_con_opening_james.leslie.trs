we should not
<Sync time="1.490"/>
end cheerleading .
<Sync time="3.300"/>
recognize first and foremost that men will always objectify women .
<Sync time="7.230"/>
all of drew's arguments
<Sync time="8.810"/>
work for banning literally any female sport
<Sync time="11.490"/>
insofar as men sexualize
<Sync time="13.465"/>
any female sport .
<Sync time="14.855"/>
i think a really good example of this is tennis
<Sync time="17.225"/>
in which even though we recognize that the women there have worked incredibly hard and are like equal to their male athletes in terms of status ,
<Sync time="24.170"/>
the way in which they are demeaned and viewed by society
<Sync time="27.100"/>
is very much in terms of the clothing that they wear
<Sync time="29.715"/>
and how attractive they are .
<Sync time="31.545"/>
recognize that the only actions we can control is our own
<Sync time="35.135"/>
and that whatever men do with our bodies or with the images of our bodies
<Sync time="38.885"/>
are separate from us
<Sync time="40.490"/>
insofar as we do not control their minds .
<Sync time="43.430"/>
we also think it's incredibly problematic
<Sync time="45.445"/>
to say that because men are shitty ,
<Sync time="47.920"/>
we ought
<Sync time="48.305"/>
change the behavior of women
<Sync time="50.200"/>
and have them have less of a community
<Sync time="52.380"/>
and less ability to choose their support .
<Sync time="54.880"/>
if this was the logic that we followed ,
<Sync time="56.770"/>
we think it would also follow that the response to islamophobia
<Sync time="60.330"/>
is to stop being be muslim ,
<Sync time="61.880"/>
or the response to
<Sync time="63.475"/>
any kind of like discrimination , on any basis ,
<Sync time="67.030"/>
means to stop
<Sync time="67.960"/>
identifying with that thing .
<Sync time="69.670"/>
insofar as women are always going to be women and they cannot control their bodies or the way that they are perceived ,
<Sync time="75.540"/>
we think that they ought have
<Sync time="76.755"/>
as many rights as possible and that these rights ought not be limited
<Sync time="80.590"/>
based on the fact that men can't control themselves .
<Sync time="83.640"/>
two main areas of clash : the first as about cheerleading as a valid s-
<Sync time="87.370"/>
form
<Sync time="87.760"/>
of a s- of athletics and art .
<Sync time="90.380"/>
um drew already concedes
<Sync time="92.180"/>
that cheerleading is a physically challenging activity ,
<Sync time="95.245"/>
but it is also physically unique
<Sync time="97.455"/>
in that the actions that are f-
<Sync time="98.885"/>
that are taken during cheerleading
<Sync time="100.865"/>
are distinct from what you'd find in other sports ,
<Sync time="103.950"/>
whether it be dance , which many consider to be quite similar ,
<Sync time="107.190"/>
or
<Sync time="107.720"/>
like a true sport ,
<Sync time="109.340"/>
such as football or soccer or basketball .
<Sync time="112.190"/>
what this means is that it is valid to prefer the activity of cheerleading to another sport
<Sync time="117.170"/>
given that it is not the case that a-
<Sync time="119.170"/>
the actions are {intermixedable/intermixable} . like just just because
<Sync time="121.765"/>

<Sync time="122.355"/>
basically what we're saying
<Sync time="123.985"/>
is that because someone could prefer the motions that are gone through in cheerleading to something else ,
<Sync time="129.295"/>
it is not the place of the government or any one individual
<Sync time="132.410"/>
to say that you could do
<Sync time="133.895"/>
any other sport
<Sync time="135.090"/>
{in--stead/instead} .
<Sync time="136.085"/>
we think that people should have as many choices as possible because in the end , they know their own situation and what will help them self-actualize
<Sync time="143.400"/>
more than any other individual .
<Sync time="145.740"/>
um
<Sync time="146.570"/>
recognize that drew's arguments are all for changing societal messages
<Sync time="151.320"/>
messaging . we think that
<Sync time="152.475"/>
it would be preferable to tell football players to respect cheerleaders ,
<Sync time="156.380"/>
um maybe don't give them overly sexual costumes or motions .
<Sync time="159.870"/>
all of these things are changeable
<Sync time="161.620"/>
without saying that without declaiming the entirety of the sport .
<Sync time="165.520"/>
second , though , we want to talk about cheerleading as a form of empowerment .
<Sync time="169.170"/>
because recognize that women get sexualized
<Sync time="171.490"/>
day to day ,
<Sync time="172.310"/>
regardless of their consent
<Sync time="174.030"/>
into those systems .
<Sync time="175.440"/>
it is an-
<Sync time="175.940"/>
more than this though ,
<Sync time="177.300"/>
we are socialized into these systems in which we are told to accept the fact that men will sexualize us without our consent
<Sync time="183.770"/>
and without
<Sync time="185.335"/>
our participation .
<Sync time="187.660"/>
um
<Sync time="188.095"/>
we think that at the end of the day , you should provide many as many avenues as possible
<Sync time="192.490"/>
by which women can then reclaim their sexuality ,
<Sync time="195.380"/>
and we think that cheerleading is an example of a sport that does that
<Sync time="198.360"/>
incredibly well . we think that being able to give women a world in which they can define their own sexuality through their own motions ,
<Sync time="205.870"/>
in which they can subvert
<Sync time="207.465"/>
their sec- um men's images of themselves ,
<Sync time="210.285"/>
as one can with sex- with cheerleading
<Sync time="212.555"/>
is really important .
<Sync time="214.305"/>
and we think that
<Sync time="215.225"/>
if someone chooses to do cheerleading of their own volition for a long time ,
<Sync time="219.060"/>
like recognize that i think neither side of the house
<Sync time="221.330"/>
supports children who are forced into cheerleading ,
<Sync time="223.825"/>
but we think that this is true for any kind of sport .
<Sync time="226.400"/>
like my mother wouldn't let me quit dancing for a really , really long time ,
<Sync time="229.895"/>
but that doesn't mean that i necessarily think
<Sync time="231.985"/>
that it was a bad
<Sync time="233.300"/>
like that we should stop dance
<Sync time="235.140"/>
altogether .
<Sync time="236.780"/>
in the at the end ,
<Sync time="237.750"/>
all our side advocates for is a world in which women
<Sync time="240.565"/>
can choose to do cheerleading ,
<Sync time="242.290"/>
and that a- and we like we don't understand why the government should be able to prevent that .
<Sync time="246.520"/>
for these reasons , proud to
<Sync time="248.615"/>
oppose .
<Sync time="250.569"/>
