physical education should be mandatory .
<Sync time="3.960"/>
so , by physical education we mean things like gym classes in primary and secondary
<Sync time="8.680"/>
school .
<Sync time="9.570"/>
so ,
<Sync time="10.595"/>
with this in mind ,
<Sync time="11.795"/>
we have three arguments for why this should be the case .
<Sync time="14.410"/>
the first is about the good of the child .
<Sync time="15.990"/>

<Sync time="16.420"/>
we think that education in general is conducted for the benefit
<Sync time="19.820"/>
of young people .
<Sync time="21.410"/>
it's
<Sync time="22.056"/>
probably the case that most ten year olds don't want to be studying
<Sync time="24.530"/>
arithmetic or shakespeare ,
<Sync time="25.610"/>

<Sync time="25.770"/>
but we make them do it anyway , because we recognize that it's for their own good .
<Sync time="29.590"/>

<Sync time="29.880"/>
there's an ancient philosophical
<Sync time="32.320"/>
maxim, sound mind in a sound body .
<Sync time="34.910"/>
we think that it's not enough to fill children's head with knowledge and
<Sync time="38.740"/>
civic skills . we think that we also need to provide them with the ability to have good
<Sync time="42.660"/>
health
<Sync time="42.780"/>
in the future , and also to be useful
<Sync time="45.400"/>
citizens .
<Sync time="46.890"/>
in terms of health ,
<Sync time="48.190"/>
it's obviously going to be
<Sync time="49.070"/>

<Sync time="49.550"/>
to the benefit of
<Sync time="50.550"/>
children 
<Sync time="51.050"/>
to provide them with a
<Sync time="52.930"/>
healthier body so that
<Sync time="54.050"/>
they will 
<Sync time="54.240"/>
be better off into
<Sync time="55.260"/>
old age .
<Sync time="55.930"/>
if people are physically fit as young people , it's much more likely that
<Sync time="59.110"/>
they'll be
<Sync time="59.550"/>
physically fit as they grow older .
<Sync time="61.740"/>
and we see that for instance , 
<Sync time="63.310"/>
who exercised more when they're younger ,
<Sync time="64.710"/>
are less at
<Sync time="65.280"/>
risk of debilitating diseases
<Sync time="66.700"/>
like
<Sync time="66.970"/>
obesity and diabetes .
<Sync time="69.060"/>
so ultimately it's in these children's
<Sync time="70.840"/>
interest
<Sync time="71.160"/>
that we put them through
<Sync time="72.660"/>
physical education .
<Sync time="73.570"/>

<Sync time="74.320"/>
but we think that another important part of physical education is sport .
<Sync time="77.755"/>
and that by playing sports ,
<Sync time="79.290"/>
young people learn important
<Sync time="80.820"/>
skills such
<Sync time="81.320"/>
as teamwork and how to accomplish
<Sync time="83.210"/>

<Sync time="83.400"/>
a common goal .
<Sync time="84.570"/>
or even if they play individual sports , they still learn the value
<Sync time="87.805"/>
of discipline ,
<Sync time="88.750"/>
and hard work in a way that they wouldn't necessarily learn
<Sync time="91.610"/>
in the classroom . so we see that
<Sync time="93.300"/>
it's clearly in the good
<Sync time="94.510"/>
of individual children
<Sync time="94.850"/>

<Sync time="95.330"/>
to require physical education .
<Sync time="97.260"/>

<Sync time="97.410"/>
and for that reason ,
<Sync time="98.510"/>
the state
<Sync time="98.940"/>
should make it mandatory ,
<Sync time="99.950"/>

<Sync time="100.130"/>
so that all of them have equal access . because , when something
<Sync time="103.020"/>

<Sync time="103.040"/>
is required , ultimately everyone has access
<Sync time="105.470"/>
to that thing .
<Sync time="107.810"/>
our second argument 
<Sync time="108.860"/>
is about why there's a compelling
<Sync time="110.460"/>
state interest in physical education .
<Sync time="112.260"/>

<Sync time="113.190"/>
so , recognize
<Sync time="114.370"/>
that in countries with conscription
<Sync time="115.840"/>
like the republic of china
<Sync time="116.094"/>

<Sync time="117.690"/>
or israel ,
<Sync time="118.700"/>
the ability of the state to have useful conscripts
<Sync time="120.920"/>

<Sync time="121.210"/>
is dependent on the
<Sync time="122.600"/>
physical fitness
<Sync time="123.220"/>
of people graduating from school every year .
<Sync time="125.880"/>

<Sync time="125.930"/>
if you have lots and lots of eighteen year olds who are graduating from secondary education
<Sync time="130.460"/>

<Sync time="130.740"/>
and they can't run a mile in eight minutes , much less
<Sync time="133.290"/>
run a mile
<Sync time="134.110"/>
in six minutes carrying a bunch of equipment ,
<Sync time="136.620"/>
then we think that at the end of the day they're not going to be particularly
<Sync time="138.870"/>
useful
<Sync time="139.590"/>
in a military operation .
<Sync time="141.900"/>
what that means is that much of their time
<Sync time="143.900"/>
in conscription
<Sync time="144.480"/>
it's going to be wasted on physical conditioning , when that could
<Sync time="147.690"/>
have all been
<Sync time="148.040"/>
done while they were in school .
<Sync time="150.350"/>
but on top of that ,
<Sync time="151.600"/>
uh citizens who are healthier are less likely to have
<Sync time="154.555"/>
health problems in the
<Sync time="155.610"/>
future .
<Sync time="155.910"/>
which means that 
<Sync time="156.765"/>
the burden on the state health care regimes such as
<Sync time="159.670"/>
national health in britain or medicare and medicaid in the united states ,
<Sync time="163.495"/>
is going to be lower because
<Sync time="164.840"/>
people will
<Sync time="165.240"/>
have fewer health problems 
<Sync time="166.800"/>
overall both in youth and in old age .
<Sync time="169.080"/>

<Sync time="169.840"/>
we think that because of this 
<Sync time="171.600"/>
clear financial
<Sync time="172.380"/>
interest , the state should intervene
<Sync time="173.740"/>
to encourage people to
<Sync time="174.880"/>
be healthy
<Sync time="175.170"/>
at a younger age .
<Sync time="176.670"/>

<Sync time="177.050"/>
our third and final point is that we think that people will be
<Sync time="180.415"/>
better employees
<Sync time="181.500"/>
if they go through this fidge-
<Sync time="182.440"/>
physical education .
<Sync time="183.870"/>
many jobs , particularly for people who don't go on to higher education ,
<Sync time="187.990"/>

<Sync time="188.020"/>
require some base level of physical
<Sync time="190.110"/>
fitness .
<Sync time="190.910"/>
it's true that you don't have to be arnold schwarzenegger to work stock
<Sync time="194.455"/>
at
<Sync time="194.950"/>
a clothing store ,
<Sync time="196.090"/>
but you do have to be able
<Sync time="197.100"/>
to lift a 50 pound box
<Sync time="198.420"/>
overr your head ,
<Sync time="199.350"/>
which is something that
<Sync time="200.405"/>
unfortunately many young people don't have the
<Sync time="202.570"/>
physical
<Sync time="202.910"/>
fitness to do right now because they don't go through this
<Sync time="205.490"/>
physical training
<Sync time="206.260"/>
in school .
<Sync time="207.680"/>
so we see that people are missing out on
<Sync time="209.140"/>
employment opportunities .
<Sync time="210.160"/>

<Sync time="210.340"/>

<Sync time="210.820"/>
and many better jobs such as manufacturing
<Sync time="212.750"/>

<Sync time="213.080"/>
et cetera ,
<Sync time="214.020"/>
require a basic level of physical
<Sync time="215.620"/>
conditioning .
<Sync time="216.400"/>
the only way to guarantee that everyone has that level of
<Sync time="219.410"/>
physical
<Sync time="219.920"/>
conditioning is through physical education 
<Sync time="221.740"/>
in schools. 
<Sync time="222.250"/>
so at the end of the day , we see that young
<Sync time="224.090"/>
people
<Sync time="224.430"/>
will be more valuable to employers ,
<Sync time="226.390"/>
which ultimately will lead to economic growth ,
<Sync time="228.470"/>
and also allow them to provide a better lives for themselves
<Sync time="231.135"/>
and their families as a result of
<Sync time="232.740"/>
this .
<Sync time="234.200"/>
so because it's to the benefit of every child and it's part of their education ,
<Sync time="238.105"/>
because the government has a clear interest in having
<Sync time="240.080"/>

<Sync time="240.140"/>
useful soldiers and healthy citizens ,
<Sync time="242.650"/>
and because it makes
<Sync time="243.270"/>
these people better employees ,
<Sync time="244.870"/>
we think that physical education should be mandatory .
<Sync time="247.560"/>
thank you .
