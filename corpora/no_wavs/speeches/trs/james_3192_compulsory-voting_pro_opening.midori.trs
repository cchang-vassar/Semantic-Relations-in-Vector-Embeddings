we should introduce compulsory voting .
<Sync time="3.920"/>
so
<Sync time="5.050"/>
what we're going to argue for you this evening
<Sync time="7.395"/>
is that countries like the united states or canada
<Sync time="11.360"/>
which do not have
<Sync time="12.625"/>
compulsory voting right now ,
<Sync time="14.520"/>
should adopt a system similar to what they have in australia ,
<Sync time="17.700"/>
whereby people have to
<Sync time="19.130"/>
go to the polls on election day
<Sync time="20.930"/>
and turn in a ballot .
<Sync time="22.265"/>
people are free to turn in a blank ballot , or write
<Sync time="25.040"/>
gandolf or darth vader on their ballot if they want to ,
<Sync time="28.420"/>
but everyone has to go to the polls
<Sync time="30.280"/>
and vote on election day .
<Sync time="32.770"/>

<Sync time="33.360"/>
so three reasons why we think this policy should be implemented in countries that don't have it yet .
<Sync time="38.880"/>
first
<Sync time="39.565"/>
we think this changes the incentives of political parties in a very positive way .
<Sync time="44.285"/>

<Sync time="44.970"/>
right now ,
<Sync time="45.700"/>
there's a huge incentive for political parties to appeal to the populations that actually go out and vote .
<Sync time="52.120"/>
after all it doesn't matter if you command a huge lead with people
<Sync time="55.305"/>
who don't go to the polls on election day .
<Sync time="58.090"/>
what does this look like ?
<Sync time="59.785"/>
it means that
<Sync time="60.930"/>
older people and wealthier people who are more likely to be able to go to the polls
<Sync time="65.640"/>
or to choose to go vote ,
<Sync time="67.510"/>
are much more likely to have political parties cater to them .
<Sync time="70.880"/>
so the interests of wealthy elderly people ,
<Sync time="73.800"/>
particularly white people 
<Sync time="75.390"/>
in countries like the u_s and canada ,
<Sync time="77.585"/>
are disproportionately influential
<Sync time="80.545"/>
in our democracy .
<Sync time="81.885"/>
we think that if you introduced compulsory voting ,
<Sync time="85.090"/>
parties would now have more of an incentive to appeal to other groups in society as well .
<Sync time="90.330"/>
in other words ,
<Sync time="90.960"/>
suddenly it matters what young black people in chicago think 
<Sync time="94.695"/>
because they're out at the polls
<Sync time="96.390"/>
in as great a numbers
<Sync time="98.085"/>
as old white people .
<Sync time="100.170"/>

<Sync time="101.115"/>
at the end of the day , we think that this is important because it means that parties want to
<Sync time="105.625"/>
appeal to more people so they will implement policies that actually help a broader
<Sync time="110.135"/>
portion of society than what we see right now 
<Sync time="112.890"/>
when they try to appeal only to a narrow section of society 
<Sync time="116.170"/>
who actually go out to vote .
<Sync time="118.640"/>
our second argument is that this would lead to better
<Sync time="121.650"/>
participatory democracy .
<Sync time="124.470"/>
so what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="127.290"/>
right now there is a tremendous amount of apathy
<Sync time="130.430"/>
in many western countries .
<Sync time="132.165"/>
in the united states'
<Sync time="133.680"/>
midterm elections ,
<Sync time="135.170"/>
ones between presidential elections that is to say ,
<Sync time="138.350"/>
often have voter turnout well below fifty percent .
<Sync time="141.375"/>
in britain ,
<Sync time="142.280"/>
voter turnout is rarely over sixty .
<Sync time="145.035"/>
on the other hand in brazil or australia ,
<Sync time="147.680"/>
obviously voter turnout is close to one hundred percent .
<Sync time="150.860"/>
what this means is that there is a greater culture in those countries of participating in elections .
<Sync time="155.880"/>

<Sync time="156.440"/>
many people in america
<Sync time="158.030"/>
or similar countries ,
<Sync time="159.380"/>
never vote in their lives . they don't feel any connection to their country's democracy . 
<Sync time="163.760"/>
this means that they're less likely to try to stay informed about the issues ,
<Sync time="167.540"/>
less likely to know who their politicians and leaders are ,
<Sync time="170.805"/>
and generally less likely to participate
<Sync time="173.180"/>
in civic society .
<Sync time="174.855"/>
we think that for democracy to be successful , people must have an incentive to participate
<Sync time="179.610"/>
and that compulsory voting
<Sync time="181.180"/>
is the best possible incentive .
<Sync time="183.795"/>

<Sync time="184.730"/>
and our third argument is that we would have a more representative government .
<Sync time="188.550"/>

<Sync time="189.270"/>
right now we see that governments as i mentioned earlier
<Sync time="192.680"/>
reflect the interests of a relatively narrow scope of people .
<Sync time="196.065"/>
but now i want to talk about what it actually looks like when you have a government that represents everyone .
<Sync time="201.240"/>

<Sync time="201.845"/>
i think it is much more likely that governments would focus on social policy , 
<Sync time="206.610"/>
on helping low income people ,
<Sync time="209.340"/>
on helping immigrant families and the like ,
<Sync time="212.180"/>
if we had compulsory voting .
<Sync time="214.165"/>
this is true because right now the government actually doesn't represent the american , canadian ,
<Sync time="219.170"/>
british , whatever country you choose , doesn't represent their people .
<Sync time="222.560"/>
it represents the voting population .
<Sync time="225.420"/>
but when you make it so that everyone is the voting population ,
<Sync time="228.150"/>
suddenly the state
<Sync time="229.345"/>
must actually care about what is good for everyone .
<Sync time="232.780"/>
at that point we think it's much more likely that you get
<Sync time="234.710"/>
policies which are tailored to the general interest
<Sync time="237.930"/>
than those which are tailored to certain special interest groups
<Sync time="240.870"/>
which vote disproportionately .
<Sync time="242.995"/>
so for these reasons , we should implement compulsory voting in countries that do not
<Sync time="247.500"/>
already do so . thank you .
<Sync time="249.639"/>
