just because something has been used for bad things ,
<Sync time="3.700"/>
doesn't mean it inherently is bad .
<Sync time="6.275"/>
the mistake that tim makes throughout his speech
<Sync time="8.975"/>
is that he
<Sync time="9.835"/>
aligns all of these problematic things
<Sync time="12.335"/>
with religion .
<Sync time="13.450"/>
sure ,
<Sync time="14.080"/>
people have used religion to warrant
<Sync time="16.270"/>
bad things ,
<Sync time="17.220"/>
but science has also been used in similar manners .
<Sync time="20.070"/>
when scientists claim that things
<Sync time="21.680"/>
inherent to the woman's body make it
<Sync time="23.470"/>
harder for her to work , and thus
<Sync time="25.205"/>
c- and thus	
<Sync time="26.770"/>
warrant why the pay gap ought exist .
<Sync time="28.670"/>
when they say
<Sync time="29.460"/>
that because of someone's race ,
<Sync time="31.050"/>
they are physically incapable of the same kind of workload as others 
<Sync time="34.980"/>
or tend to have certain traits .
<Sync time="37.105"/>
we think that
<Sync time="37.845"/>
in the same way that we don't disc- denounce all of science because it has been used to warrant racist or sexist views ,
<Sync time="44.195"/>
we also don't denounce religion
<Sync time="46.120"/>
just because people started war over it .
<Sync time="48.090"/>
we think that what tim is saying is basically that people are shitty .
<Sync time="51.140"/>
but just because people are bad ,
<Sync time="52.860"/>
doesn't mean the things that they do
<Sync time="54.490"/>
are always th- the things that they use
<Sync time="56.935"/>
are also bad .
<Sync time="58.330"/>
we think that what matters in this round is the good that religion has done .
<Sync time="61.710"/>
insofar as it is probably the case that people will pick wars on either side of the house ,
<Sync time="66.330"/>
the question is what core beliefs those people carry
<Sync time="69.340"/>
and how they personally feel about themselves .
<Sync time="71.900"/>
two main areas of clash . the first on self-actualization
<Sync time="75.130"/>
and closure .
<Sync time="76.050"/>
we think that there are things that can never be explained %hes
<Sync time="78.600"/>
by science .
<Sync time="79.620"/>
questions such as , why do i exist ?
<Sync time="81.940"/>
why am i here on earth ?
<Sync time="83.500"/>
what is the purpose of my life ?
<Sync time="85.360"/>
what happens after i die ?
<Sync time="87.160"/>
all of these ei- are either questions that science will never answer ,
<Sync time="90.750"/>
or that we have to wait hundreds of years to answer .
<Sync time="93.905"/>
but we think that people are harmed by the active n- lack of knowledge about these .
<Sync time="98.330"/>
we think that it can cause massive amounts of anxiety
<Sync time="101.290"/>
to question what happens to your dying uncle after he leaves ,
<Sync time="104.870"/>
to question whether or not there is an afterlife for yourself when you die ,
<Sync time="108.795"/>
and whether or not you'll be able to still see the children that you leave behind .
<Sync time="112.230"/>
all of these are things that people need to have closure for that religion provides .
<Sync time="116.325"/>
because having someone say ,
<Sync time="118.190"/>
it's alright , no matter what happens you'll be okay because god is there , is also would allows us to go to the rest of our lives productively
<Sync time="125.390"/>
without being afraid of these things .
<Sync time="128.020"/>
but tim is like oh ,
<Sync time="129.380"/>
but all this does is breed people who are non-skeptical and don't question .
<Sync time="133.485"/>
but this just isn't the case , right ?
<Sync time="135.270"/>
we think there's a difference between believing in a god and skepticism in other situations .
<Sync time="139.595"/>
in fact , we think that certain religions teach people to question more .
<Sync time="143.445"/>
a certain l- like a central tenet of judaism is to question the learnings and argue about them ,
<Sync time="148.150"/>
similarly to buddhism .
<Sync time="149.810"/>
at the point that we don't think this meaningfully tells people to be sheeple ,
<Sync time="153.340"/>
but rather just says
<Sync time="155.155"/>
you should believe in this religion {doc--trine/doctrine} ,
<Sync time="158.040"/>
all this teaches people is to
<Sync time="159.635"/>
choose to believe in th-
<Sync time="161.310"/>
choose to believe things that
<Sync time="163.190"/>
while still understanding when logic also exists .
<Sync time="166.700"/>
the majority of religious people will acknowledge that their belief is not entirely rational ,
<Sync time="170.875"/>
but say that they need it
<Sync time="172.230"/>
because it {pro--tects/protects} them from
<Sync time="173.440"/>
protects them f- their functioning in other situations .
<Sync time="176.130"/>
we think that a lot of
<Sync time="177.020"/>
massive scientific figures , such as einstein , the cuban doctor who discovered %unclear pluripotent stem cells ,
<Sync time="182.590"/>
are people who are
<Sync time="183.560"/>
highly religious but still understood
<Sync time="186.230"/>
that you can also be a scientist ,
<Sync time="187.940"/>
also understand logic .
<Sync time="189.340"/>
second area of clash has to do with communities and the good that religious religions have done .
<Sync time="193.850"/>
because we think that religions preach generally good moral things .
<Sync time="197.605"/>
and sure , maybe these moral things are pushed upon their population ,
<Sync time="201.290"/>
as tim says ,
<Sync time="202.265"/>
but we just don't think that we care ,
<Sync time="204.090"/>
as long as this means that less people think it's okay to murder others
<Sync time="207.650"/>
or steal things .
<Sync time="209.345"/>
we think that these beliefs
<Sync time="211.120"/>
motivate incredibly positive things for society .
<Sync time="214.120"/>
millions of food banks , homeless shelters ,
<Sync time="216.690"/>
like other kinds of situations are run by churches
<Sync time="220.040"/>
and and synagogues and other religious institutes .
<Sync time="222.885"/>
we think that they encourage their youth to do things like volunteer , empathize with the poor ,
<Sync time="227.090"/>
recognize people's situations .
<Sync time="228.960"/>
all of these doctrines are things that we actually think science lacks ,
<Sync time="232.155"/>
insofar as straight up logic will tell you that
<Sync time="234.970"/>
%hes
<Sync time="235.230"/>
will tell you things like 
<Sync time="236.545"/>
you're just not working hard enough to be successful ,
<Sync time="239.810"/>
or other claims .
<Sync time="240.880"/>
but we also think that the friendly communities that people form within these religions are incredibly important .
<Sync time="245.530"/>
to have someone who believes the same things as you and is willing to support you 
<Sync time="249.360"/>
is
<Sync time="249.655"/>
very helpful for when you fall upon hard times , or need a community behind you . for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="256.598"/>
