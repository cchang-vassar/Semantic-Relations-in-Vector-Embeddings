we should legalize polygamy .
<Sync time="2.525"/>
so , at the very beginning , we want to recognize that
<Sync time="5.165"/>
polygamy has a connotation associated with it ,
<Sync time="7.620"/>
that
<Sync time="8.200"/>
is often has to do with the coercion of individuals ,
<Sync time="10.710"/>
specifically women to marry
<Sync time="12.420"/>
one man , and
<Sync time="13.625"/>
like a cult situation , or things of this nature .
<Sync time="16.370"/>
we just want to say that we believe that ,
<Sync time="18.020"/>
in legalizing polygamy ,
<Sync time="19.410"/>
there are still checks that can be put in place , to ensure that , for example ,
<Sync time="22.960"/>
people that are under a certain age are not able to do this ,
<Sync time="25.830"/>
to ensure that people that are being coerced are not forced into doing this , that you can
<Sync time="29.940"/>
ensure , as the state , that proper steps are taken
<Sync time="33.110"/>
to ensure that people are not coerced into doing this .
<Sync time="35.750"/>
so ,
<Sync time="36.525"/>
in that respect ,
<Sync time="37.750"/>
we think that it is the fundamental right of people
<Sync time="40.685"/>
to freely choose to consent
<Sync time="43.170"/>
into a loving relationship , and that
<Sync time="45.280"/>
in denying the access to polygamous relationships , and the legitimacy of polygamous relationships ,
<Sync time="50.400"/>
you deny the right to people ,
<Sync time="52.780"/>
consenting adults , to love one another in the way the see fit .
<Sync time="56.700"/>
okay , so first we're gonna talk about laws broadly ,
<Sync time="59.665"/>
and then we're going to talk about why polygamy itself
<Sync time="61.890"/>
is not problematic . okay ,
<Sync time="63.580"/>
so , we think that criminalization
<Sync time="66.080"/>
should not be based on the enforcement of
<Sync time="68.500"/>
moral norms ,
<Sync time="69.880"/>
and of particular attitudes . we think that the reason that polygamy became legal , in the first place ,
<Sync time="75.235"/>
is because there is an association of polygamy
<Sync time="77.370"/>
with certain bad moral actors ,
<Sync time="79.430"/>
and that as such , individuals felt that they need to enforce their own moral systems
<Sync time="84.060"/>
onto individuals . we don't think this is a proper justification
<Sync time="87.435"/>
for inhibiting someone's freedom .
<Sync time="89.690"/>
we think that laws should only be constructed
<Sync time="92.135"/>
in order to maximize freedom , and what this means is that ,
<Sync time="95.050"/>
laws should be constructed ,
<Sync time="96.400"/>
insofar as
<Sync time="97.420"/>
if someone is taking action that violates another individual's freedom ,
<Sync time="101.385"/>
that restricts their ability to freely do as they see fit 
<Sync time="104.960"/>
in a meaningful way ,
<Sync time="106.090"/>
we think that it is justified
<Sync time="107.935"/>
in making such an action
<Sync time="109.490"/>
illegal , in certain circumstances .
<Sync time="111.890"/>
but in the case of polygamy ,
<Sync time="113.390"/>
we see no such way
<Sync time="115.035"/>
in which a polygamous relationship , or polygamous marriage ,
<Sync time="118.220"/>
in
<Sync time="118.590"/>
any way undermines the freedom
<Sync time="120.495"/>
of other individuals .
<Sync time="121.920"/>
if
<Sync time="122.175"/>
i and two other people love each other , and agree
<Sync time="124.925"/>
that we love each other , and consent
<Sync time="127.285"/>
to being in that type of relationship ,
<Sync time="129.630"/>
we see no way in which our love has any sort of impact
<Sync time="133.285"/>
on other individuals .
<Sync time="134.670"/>
if there's some sort of
<Sync time="135.680"/>
emotional repercussions , that other individuals experience ,
<Sync time="139.190"/>
it is not the job of government to ensure , that people are always comfortable with the actions of all other individuals ,
<Sync time="145.330"/>
or otherwise , you would have to criminalize almost every action , that an individual could feasibly take , because someone is going to be-
<Sync time="152.660"/>
is going to find those actions
<Sync time="154.680"/>
repugnant .
<Sync time="155.570"/>
we think that polygamy ,
<Sync time="157.170"/>
that love cannot be quantified into a simple idea
<Sync time="160.700"/>
that one person loves another person ,
<Sync time="163.235"/>
and that love
<Sync time="164.130"/>
is reciprocal in nature . we don't think that love can be restrained to traditional marriage ideals ,
<Sync time="169.130"/>
and to the idea that it could only be between two consenting individuals . we think that love
<Sync time="173.845"/>
is much more broad than that ,
<Sync time="175.615"/>
and that in criminalizing polygamy in the status quo ,
<Sync time="178.810"/>
we deny that love as legitimate . we tell people that their relationship
<Sync time="183.170"/>
is improper , we demonize people ,
<Sync time="185.610"/>
because they have emotional attachments to more than one individual .
<Sync time="189.470"/>
we don't think there's any justification for this ,
<Sync time="191.970"/>
insofar as people , who are in these polygamous relationships , do not harm other individuals .
<Sync time="197.160"/>
as such ,
<Sync time="198.190"/>
we believe that it is essential that the state
<Sync time="200.430"/>
does not construct laws
<Sync time="202.100"/>
on the basis
<Sync time="203.175"/>
of
<Sync time="203.620"/>
emotional or moral repugnance , but simply
<Sync time="206.425"/>
on the basis of ensuring the maximal
<Sync time="209.080"/>
freedom
<Sync time="209.825"/>
of its citizenry .
<Sync time="211.090"/>
and for these reasons , we believe we should legalize
<Sync time="214.430"/>
polygamy .
<Sync time="216.130"/>
