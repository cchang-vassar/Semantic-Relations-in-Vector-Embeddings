we should further {exploits/exploit}
<Sync time="2.290"/>
hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="4.160"/>
it is a fact that using traditional non-renewable sources of energy production like fossil fuels
<Sync time="9.830"/>
is hugely contributing to climate change 
<Sync time="12.520"/>
and it is a fact that climate change poses a great risk to our entire species .
<Sync time="18.060"/>
i doubt that my opponent will try
<Sync time="20.365"/>
and deny these things because if they choose to do so
<Sync time="23.690"/>
they are going directly against the strongly held scientific
<Sync time="26.795"/>
consensus .
<Sync time="28.050"/>
the only logical conclusion of both these facts
<Sync time="30.860"/>
is of course that we as a species
<Sync time="33.270"/>
must quickly endeavor to make a substantial transition
<Sync time="36.950"/>
from the way we are used to produce energy
<Sync time="39.345"/>
and aim to rely much more on renewable energy sources .
<Sync time="43.735"/>

<Sync time="44.270"/>
there's also the additional little problem with non-renewable energy sources
<Sync time="48.780"/>
being non-renewable . meaning
<Sync time="50.845"/>
they will eventually end .
<Sync time="52.625"/>
this makes prices incredibly unstable in the short term
<Sync time="56.500"/>
and of course
<Sync time="57.470"/>
forces us to find alternative renewable solutions anyway in the long term .
<Sync time="62.130"/>
so we
<Sync time="63.405"/>
might as well find them as soon as possible and not be caught with our pants down in the future .
<Sync time="68.935"/>

<Sync time="69.450"/>
another reason we must develop alternative energy
<Sync time="72.205"/>
solutions to fossil fuels
<Sync time="74.220"/>
has to do
<Sync time="75.005"/>
with political and economic reasons .
<Sync time="77.650"/>
our great dependence on oil and gas
<Sync time="80.670"/>
and fuel 
<Sync time="81.350"/>
has made us hugely dependent on countries and regions who were blessed with large reserves of these resources 
<Sync time="87.515"/>
and those just happened to be countries
<Sync time="89.740"/>
in the persian gulf .
<Sync time="91.370"/>
this creates a problem in the west
<Sync time="93.260"/>
as some of these countries are outright
<Sync time="95.760"/>
ideological enemies , like iran ,
<Sync time="98.350"/>
and others are
<Sync time="100.065"/>
problematic
<Sync time="101.570"/>
non-natural allies , like saudi arabia or
<Sync time="105.050"/>
qatar , that have
<Sync time="107.030"/>
fanatic religious regimes and horrid human rights abuses . yet we are compelled to overlook those
<Sync time="113.000"/>
in favor of economic incentives .
<Sync time="115.660"/>
having said all of that ,
<Sync time="117.900"/>
what are our options ?
<Sync time="119.840"/>
well basically
<Sync time="120.990"/>
there's solar power solutions , there's wind power solutions ,
<Sync time="124.670"/>
and there's water power solutions .
<Sync time="127.300"/>
we on side government believe that all of th- all of the above are important directions to pursue
<Sync time="132.730"/>
and are in no way mutually exclusive .
<Sync time="135.680"/>
the most dominant and effective among the water power solutions is of course hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="141.950"/>
now
<Sync time="142.310"/>
opposition may talk about how these dams create some environmental harms .
<Sync time="147.300"/>
and perhaps that's true 
<Sync time="149.005"/>
but providing enough energy to sustain the modern way of life
<Sync time="153.405"/>
is a messy business no matter how we look at it . and when it comes to protecting the environment
<Sync time="158.720"/>
we need to think in terms of how to minimize the harm 
<Sync time="162.250"/>
since it's just not plausible to completely ,
<Sync time="165.310"/>
entirely avoid it .
<Sync time="167.285"/>
so
<Sync time="168.215"/>
in comparison with using non-renewable energy sources ,
<Sync time="172.650"/>
of course that whatever environmental harms these dams create are almost negligible .
<Sync time="178.310"/>
but it's also possible that
<Sync time="180.250"/>
hydroelectric dams create more harm than using wind turbines ,
<Sync time="184.650"/>
even though i'm not sure that that's the case , or solar panels , again even though i'm not
<Sync time="188.910"/>
an expert 
<Sync time="189.805"/>
and i don't really know ,
<Sync time="191.385"/>
but it's possible .
<Sync time="192.780"/>
and so opposition may want to talk
<Sync time="194.600"/>
tell you that's the true comparative here are
<Sync time="197.260"/>
these other renewable sources of energy 
<Sync time="200.540"/>
and that we should further exploit them
<Sync time="203.090"/>
instead of hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="206.080"/>
but the truth of the matter is that
<Sync time="208.400"/>
there just isn't enough potential
<Sync time="211.040"/>
in wind or solar power harnessing
<Sync time="214.025"/>
to satisfy the massive energy consumption of the modern society .
<Sync time="218.310"/>
hydroelectric dams
<Sync time="220.230"/>
account for roughly eighty five percent of renewable energy production nowadays . 
<Sync time="225.260"/>
which means
<Sync time="226.090"/>
that it's production capabilities and
<Sync time="228.380"/>
potential far outweigh the other renewable solutions and so
<Sync time="232.995"/>
we basically are left with no choice but to further exploit
<Sync time="237.580"/>
hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="239.837"/>
