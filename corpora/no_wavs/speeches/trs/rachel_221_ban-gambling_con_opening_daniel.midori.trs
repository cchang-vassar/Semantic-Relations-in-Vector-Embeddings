op agrees that gambling is generally a bad thing that ought be discouraged in society .
<Sync time="6.765"/>
but there is a difference between discouraging it
<Sync time="9.410"/>
and banning it .
<Sync time="10.290"/>
and we think that even though it is justified to discourage things that are bad for society ,
<Sync time="14.670"/>
it is not justified to ban it
<Sync time="16.400"/>
unless they can show
<Sync time="17.510"/>
a distinct third party harm
<Sync time="19.915"/>
that is worthy of compromising one's rights on .
<Sync time="23.040"/>
we don't think government did it , but here are some examples of regulations .
<Sync time="27.020"/>
we think that maybe the government should first stop
<Sync time="29.770"/>
propping gambling
<Sync time="30.700"/>
up .
<Sync time="31.175"/>
and also you can even explain the risks
<Sync time="33.740"/>
much in the same way that
<Sync time="35.075"/>
even though smoking is damaging to myself and third parties and
<Sync time="38.875"/>
secondhand smoke can be damaging to others ,
<Sync time="41.880"/>
the government cannot ban me from inhaling tobacco smoke .
<Sync time="45.190"/>
rather they can put a sticker on every package that tells me ,
<Sync time="48.180"/>
don't do this , in the same way we think that
<Sync time="50.940"/>
op would be accepting of regulations imposed against gambling that requires the disclosure of the risks
<Sync time="56.390"/>
or warning labels to be all over the place .
<Sync time="58.870"/>
but banning is what government had to prove .
<Sync time="61.060"/>
with that ,
<Sync time="61.930"/>
two main areas of clash :
<Sync time="63.385"/>
the first on why we think this is a legitimate action within the market
<Sync time="66.810"/>
that cannot be banned .
<Sync time="68.150"/>
we think that
<Sync time="68.695"/>
most businesses are , in part , ripping off the consumer to make money .
<Sync time="73.180"/>
even something as innocuous as insurance
<Sync time="75.660"/>
operates on the person's fear or risk of injury
<Sync time="78.725"/>
to make them
<Sync time="79.490"/>
overpay
<Sync time="80.520"/>
so that afterwards they might pay a little bit less
<Sync time="83.325"/>
for some operation 
<Sync time="85.065"/>
and is widely considered not worth it 
<Sync time="87.800"/>
given that
<Sync time="88.340"/>
any given individual's risk for developing an injury 
<Sync time="91.315"/>
is low . but we do it and we allow insurance corporations to exist regardless of the fact that they are ripping off the consumer
<Sync time="98.800"/>
because it is okay for them to make money off ripping off the consumer
<Sync time="102.680"/>
as long as the consumer's
<Sync time="103.960"/>
freely choosing to pay into that system .
<Sync time="106.700"/>
we think that in a capitalist economy we let business
<Sync time="109.520"/>
mi- businesses make money in this way
<Sync time="111.770"/>
and pop up where the desire comes from and
<Sync time="114.290"/>

<Sync time="114.825"/>
even if they if they're making money off of others poor choices ,
<Sync time="118.360"/>
as long as those people are not being able being coerced into that system
<Sync time="122.150"/>
by like
<Sync time="122.950"/>
any like massive harm or threat ,
<Sync time="125.190"/>
than that system is allowed to exist .
<Sync time="127.520"/>
otherwise it is an unfair imposition of the government into the market
<Sync time="130.820"/>
and cannot occur .
<Sync time="132.680"/>
our secondary of clash has to do as to why this is a legitimate choice of the person and the government cannot interfere with that right .
<Sync time="139.390"/>
because we think that in the end ,
<Sync time="140.755"/>
people have a right to make bad decisions .
<Sync time="143.340"/>
even if i think that there are better ways to spend money than
<Sync time="146.560"/>
buying
<Sync time="147.390"/>
than gambling or
<Sync time="149.005"/>
a comparable example might be
<Sync time="150.745"/>
buying things in online games ,
<Sync time="152.950"/>
this is what my opinion is and i don't get to impose this opinion on other people ,
<Sync time="157.520"/>
because in the end i do not know their life ,
<Sync time="159.940"/>
i do not know what they can afford ,
<Sync time="161.810"/>
or what they think is more important to them .
<Sync time="163.850"/>
some people do prioritize being able to
<Sync time="166.720"/>
gamble or pay into games
<Sync time="168.540"/>
more than they prioritize their own health .
<Sync time="170.710"/>
is this a problem ?
<Sync time="171.850"/>
yes , but it's also their problem and not one that the government gets to interfere in ,
<Sync time="175.830"/>
much in the way that it is their decision if they want to smoke cigarettes ,
<Sync time="179.210"/>
and not the right of the government to say , i'm sorry but you can't .
<Sync time="182.815"/>

<Sync time="183.600"/>
we think that in the end
<Sync time="185.060"/>
the
<Sync time="185.440"/>
interfering into these kinds of rights can be incredibly harmful , because at the point that the government can just decide , because there are
<Sync time="191.500"/>
better alternatives , we are going to ban this one ,
<Sync time="193.950"/>
there's nothing standing between a democratic government
<Sync time="196.655"/>
and just dictating everything that your citizens must do .
<Sync time="199.655"/>
ah yes , there is a certain exercise regime that is much better than what you're currently doing ,
<Sync time="204.270"/>
we're going to ban not exercising .
<Sync time="206.690"/>
these are the examples of what comes along when you start imposing on people's rights .
<Sync time="210.610"/>
we think in the end ,
<Sync time="211.690"/>
people will always make bad decisions and the government cannot regulate them all away .
<Sync time="216.760"/>
what this means
<Sync time="217.605"/>
is that sometimes you're just going to have to stand there
<Sync time="220.375"/>
and watch .
<Sync time="221.250"/>
in the end ,
<Sync time="222.030"/>
that person knows themselves better than a large bureaucratic body that has never met them 
<Sync time="226.570"/>
ever will .
<Sync time="227.420"/>
and even though gambling is damaging to some ,
<Sync time="229.565"/>
it is certainly not damaging to all ,
<Sync time="231.535"/>
and certainly not damaging
<Sync time="232.860"/>
enough that it ought be banned .
<Sync time="234.620"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="237.810"/>
