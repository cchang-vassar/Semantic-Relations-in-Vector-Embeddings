we should not disband a_s_e_a_n .
<Sync time="3.120"/>
so ,
<Sync time="3.930"/>
a_s_e_a_n is the association of southeast asian states . as the last speaker pointed out to you ,
<Sync time="8.770"/>
it's made up of a group of states
<Sync time="10.560"/>
in southeast asia who are working together towards common goals
<Sync time="13.765"/>
of development .
<Sync time="15.110"/>
three reasons why we should not disband it .
<Sync time="17.470"/>
first is about
<Sync time="18.340"/>
anti-colonialism .
<Sync time="20.100"/>
recognize that for developing countries like the ones in a_s_e_a_n like malaysia , like indonesia ,
<Sync time="25.200"/>
they have a few alternatives for who they can turn to as trade partners .
<Sync time="29.280"/>
you have major international trading countries like the states ,
<Sync time="32.750"/>
like china ,
<Sync time="33.700"/>
like e_u countries ,
<Sync time="35.020"/>
which historically have treated these countries in a very colonialist way .
<Sync time="38.980"/>
most of the countries in a_s_e_a_n except for thailand were once colonized by european countries
<Sync time="43.680"/>
or the united states , and if you look back before that ,
<Sync time="46.580"/>
they had a semi colonial relationship
<Sync time="48.810"/>
with china in many instances , such the relationship between vietnam
<Sync time="52.580"/>
and china .
<Sync time="53.360"/>
so we see that there's a history
<Sync time="54.870"/>
of abuse and mistreatment between these uh
<Sync time="57.600"/>
larger countries around the world the more powerful countries ,
<Sync time="60.480"/>
and the a_s_e_a_n countries .
<Sync time="62.515"/>
we think that by working together ,
<Sync time="64.750"/>
the a_s_e_a_n countries can ensure that they are a large enough
<Sync time="67.610"/>
economic bloc to prevent
<Sync time="69.245"/>
these major international powers who have historically come in
<Sync time="72.335"/>
and pushed them around , from dominating the region ,
<Sync time="74.945"/>
in other words ,
<Sync time="75.710"/>
a_s_e_a_n makes all of these countries that together
<Sync time="78.590"/>
uh are strong and able to resist
<Sync time="80.630"/>
imperialist aggression or trade policy ,
<Sync time="83.495"/>
and would all individually
<Sync time="85.090"/>
not be that powerful . it allows them to work together
<Sync time="87.875"/>
towards a common goal of independence and it reassures the independence of every member state
<Sync time="92.440"/>
from
<Sync time="92.925"/>
international oppression and dependence on one country for trade .
<Sync time="97.350"/>
our second argument ,
<Sync time="98.475"/>
is about why we think that fundamentally a_s_e_a_n increases development and that's the highest good in this round .
<Sync time="104.120"/>
so first , why is development the most important good ?
<Sync time="106.705"/>
if you think about the quality of life in a_s_e_a_n countries ,
<Sync time="109.770"/>
obviously it varies . people in uh malaysia for instance have
<Sync time="112.840"/>
like a middle income quality of life , people in vietnam
<Sync time="115.660"/>
are much poorer , but we think that
<Sync time="117.570"/>
overall everyone in all of these countries could still benefit from more development .
<Sync time="121.790"/>
we think that there is a moral imperative
<Sync time="124.205"/>
for states to seek out development for their citizens .
<Sync time="127.460"/>
why is this so ?
<Sync time="128.710"/>
so when we say a moral imperative we mean that states always have an obligation to seek this out .
<Sync time="133.150"/>
we think that because ,
<Sync time="134.195"/>
any person would always choose to live in the most developed country possible so that they have the highest quality of life ,
<Sync time="140.070"/>
those with the ability to do so , those who reap the benefits of developed life ,
<Sync time="143.890"/>
because they're elites ,
<Sync time="144.590"/>
should try to provide it to everyone else . to sort of do unto others
<Sync time="148.295"/>
as you would have them do unto you 
<Sync time="150.170"/>
type of thinking .
<Sync time="151.535"/>
we see that ,
<Sync time="152.845"/>
development is more likely with a_s_e_a_n . one ,
<Sync time="155.430"/>
because countries have more access to trade partners and trade goods ,
<Sync time="158.840"/>
so it's more like that they're able to specialize
<Sync time="160.965"/>
and develop industries that can then
<Sync time="162.805"/>
take advantage of other markets within a_s_e_a_n ,
<Sync time="165.265"/>
and two , because of the access to economic development
<Sync time="167.830"/>
expertise .
<Sync time="169.020"/>
recognize that many countries in a_s_e_a_n ,
<Sync time="171.260"/>
are at different levels of development .
<Sync time="173.110"/>
malaysia is pretty far along ,
<Sync time="175.010"/>
some other countries are not as far along .
<Sync time="176.995"/>
so we tell you that people
<Sync time="178.290"/>
in a_s_e_a_n countries can study in other countries and learn about
<Sync time="181.755"/>
development and industry ,
<Sync time="183.315"/>
and how other countries have been successful in the past ,
<Sync time="185.830"/>
and use this in order to help their own home country .
<Sync time="188.380"/>
so at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="189.505"/>
we help the people who are worse off in the world , some of them ,
<Sync time="192.385"/>
some of these very poor people who live in a_s_e_a_n countries because we better access development
<Sync time="196.720"/>
so we shouldn't
<Sync time="197.570"/>
disband a_s_e_a_n .
<Sync time="199.030"/>
our last argument is about peace in the region .
<Sync time="202.310"/>
recognize that there are many
<Sync time="203.950"/>
potential sources of conflict within the southeast asia region .
<Sync time="207.740"/>
some countries are more closely aligned with china so they see an advantage in
<Sync time="210.900"/>
china becoming more hegemonic ,
<Sync time="212.490"/>
some countries are more aligned with the united states .
<Sync time="215.030"/>
some countries are communists ,
<Sync time="216.410"/>
some countries are capitalist .
<Sync time="217.875"/>
there's been conflict in the past over east timor ,
<Sync time="220.395"/>
and there are other ethnic tensions boiling beneath the surface
<Sync time="223.450"/>
in many southeast asian countries .
<Sync time="225.500"/>
but one of the surest ways to prevent international conflict ,
<Sync time="228.255"/>
is to tie everyone's interests together through trade .
<Sync time="231.000"/>
if everyone stands to get richer through peace and poorer through conflict ,
<Sync time="234.760"/>
then it's much less likely that a war will break out
<Sync time="237.000"/>
in the region .
<Sync time="238.060"/>
so for that reason we think a_s_e_a_n is a tremendous tool for peace in southeast asia
<Sync time="242.095"/>
in the future .
<Sync time="243.230"/>
so because it's an anti colonial institution ,
<Sync time="245.720"/>
because it promotes development , and because it will lead to peace in the region ,
<Sync time="248.890"/>
we should not disband a_s_e_a_n thank you .
<Sync time="251.389"/>
