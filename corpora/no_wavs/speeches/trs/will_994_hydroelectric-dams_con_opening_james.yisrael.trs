i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion that we should
<Sync time="3.380"/>
further exploit hydroelectric dams .
<Sync time="6.200"/>
my first independent point is that
<Sync time="8.220"/>
hydroelectric dams disrupt the local ecosystem .
<Sync time="11.890"/>
ask of points out
<Sync time="13.360"/>
um there is significant impact on the local environment particularly the river itself
<Sync time="18.270"/>
generated by the presence of a hydroelectric dam .
<Sync time="21.280"/>
the guv
<Sync time="21.990"/>
example of this is um migratory fish but we think it's actually much more profound than that .
<Sync time="27.300"/>
we think that specifically the flow rate of an individual river
<Sync time="31.090"/>
can affect things like whether or not
<Sync time="33.080"/>
animals can bathe and drink from that whether w- river
<Sync time="36.460"/>
we think it
<Sync time="37.120"/>
shapes the actual landscape down river because river speed determines whether or not it
<Sync time="42.555"/>
washes up sand in a particular way or it carves out land in a particular way to
<Sync time="47.725"/>
form a deeper river basin
<Sync time="49.740"/>
and as such
<Sync time="50.660"/>
entire ecosystems not just within the river that rely on the river itself to move
<Sync time="55.660"/>
but also s-
<Sync time="56.650"/>
rivers
<Sync time="57.230"/>
sur-
<Sync time="57.610"/>
surrounding ecosystem supported by the river
<Sync time="60.640"/>
such as say like bears or something
<Sync time="62.790"/>
that live nearby
<Sync time="64.110"/>
are heavily dependent on a precise flow rate at the river .
<Sync time="68.030"/>
we think then
<Sync time="68.855"/>
that when one introduces a hydroelectric dam
<Sync time="71.480"/>
this has a profound impact on the ecosystem .
<Sync time="74.510"/>
this is important for two reasons .
<Sync time="76.135"/>
first we believe that in uh
<Sync time="78.225"/>
any damages sustained by wildlife
<Sync time="80.390"/>
in and of themselves are problematic because we believe that it's important to mitigate animal suffering .
<Sync time="85.720"/>
we think that rights are derived largely from whether or not
<Sync time="89.435"/>
a being has preferences that is to say whether or not
<Sync time="92.470"/>
it can say
<Sync time="93.675"/>
that is painful i don't want it to happen to me .
<Sync time="96.330"/>
at that point then we think it's important to preserve uh you know animal life um
<Sync time="101.100"/>
and access to you know good water food that sort of thing to ensure it has a healthy and happy life .
<Sync time="107.300"/>
but secondly we think that preserving ecosystems is important
<Sync time="110.590"/>
even from a human centric position
<Sync time="112.665"/>
because large amounts of things like that humans derive from the ecosystem
<Sync time="117.160"/>
are reliant on its stability .
<Sync time="119.010"/>
things like food .
<Sync time="120.220"/>
things like research .
<Sync time="121.740"/>
these sorts of things are heavily disrupted when the ecosystem
<Sync time="124.910"/>
itself is disrupted
<Sync time="126.420"/>
because
<Sync time="127.035"/>
even minor changes can cause large chain reactions in food chains
<Sync time="131.850"/>
and in life support systems like rivers .
<Sync time="134.420"/>

<Sync time="135.240"/>
our second independent point is that
<Sync time="137.150"/>
hydroelectric dams have comparatively lower employment rates than other forms of energy
<Sync time="142.220"/>
including renewable energy
<Sync time="144.035"/>
and at that point we think that contrary to government's model we should do you prioritize construction of them .
<Sync time="150.110"/>

<Sync time="150.720"/>
energy infrastructures is an important employer
<Sync time="153.050"/>
largely because of how much staffing it often requires .
<Sync time="156.355"/>
things like say nuclear power plants
<Sync time="158.770"/>
require a large amount of people constantly staffing it
<Sync time="161.995"/>
to ensure that you know things don't go wrong .
<Sync time="164.525"/>
and we think that's important because it provides people with jobs . this is of course you know
<Sync time="168.235"/>
the life blood of any economy is insuring that people have the capital to buy things so that the wheels can keep turning .
<Sync time="175.030"/>
hydroelectric dams have low employment rates though precisely because of the benefits touted by side government
<Sync time="180.540"/>
that they run more or less automatically and really only need occasional maintenance from high skilled workers .
<Sync time="187.040"/>
that's a problem
<Sync time="187.995"/>
because as compared to something like say nuclear power or like say solar power
<Sync time="192.810"/>
there isn't a lot of day to day maintenance there isn't a need for a large employment staff
<Sync time="197.230"/>
and as a result we think that even if energy costs are slightly higher without hydroelectric power
<Sync time="203.010"/>
there is a significantly higher impact on the broader economy
<Sync time="206.120"/>
by the lower employment rates generated by this form of technology .
<Sync time="210.170"/>
our third and final independent point is that this is simply an eyesore .
<Sync time="214.410"/>
so we think that a lot of
<Sync time="215.950"/>
rivers particularly run through scenic areas that
<Sync time="218.780"/>
have both cultural and uh
<Sync time="220.585"/>
more tourism related reasons for maintaining their beauty .
<Sync time="224.330"/>
hydroelectric dams are often large unwieldy and not very pleasant to look at
<Sync time="229.180"/>
and because they're situated on rivers
<Sync time="231.430"/>
they're often b- creating an eyesore in the most beautiful part of the landscape
<Sync time="235.850"/>
we think then that because
<Sync time="237.220"/>
a there are preferences in the locals to keep these areas looking the way that they look and b
<Sync time="242.740"/>
there more fiscal reasons tied to things like the tourism industry
<Sync time="246.300"/>
it's problematic to create large eye sores like this . proud to oppose
<Sync time="250.950"/>
