the problem with will
<Sync time="2.990"/>
is that he seems to assume
<Sync time="4.815"/>
that the only way in which you can tell kids
<Sync time="7.145"/>
not to get pregnant ,
<Sync time="8.430"/>
is by telling them to only be abstinent .
<Sync time="10.930"/>
the problem with this is that you can still have a sex-ed class 
<Sync time="14.320"/>
that says : "if you don't wanna get pregnant 
<Sync time="16.610"/>
abstinence is the only certainty , "
<Sync time="18.555"/>
and then continues to say
<Sync time="20.080"/>
" but maybe you weren't abstinent . 
<Sync time="22.120"/>
here's how you still prevent pregnancy .
<Sync time="24.240"/>
here's how you still prevent s_t_d's . "
<Sync time="26.855"/>
then he says that you shouldn't be having sex . like , maybe . the problem with this is that high schooler is exactly around the age
<Sync time="33.325"/>
in which people are both
<Sync time="34.350"/>
physically
<Sync time="35.080"/>
and emotionally developed enough to enter into relationships
<Sync time="38.245"/>
and begin to consent .
<Sync time="39.930"/>
these are also the times in which people learn about consent and learn about healthy relationships ,
<Sync time="45.120"/>
so it's unclear what he gets to be paternalistic about it
<Sync time="48.080"/>
especially when it isn't effective .
<Sync time="50.390"/>
three main areas of clash :
<Sync time="51.940"/>
first on why abstinence only sexual education
<Sync time="55.190"/>
contributes to pregnancy and s_t_d's .
<Sync time="57.500"/>
over and over ,
<Sync time="58.710"/>
abstinence only sex ed
<Sync time="60.110"/>
has been proven not to work .
<Sync time="62.450"/>
all that happens is that kids still have sex
<Sync time="64.985"/>
but now they don't know how to do it safely .
<Sync time="67.520"/>
when you make a subject taboo
<Sync time="69.210"/>
you're going to want to do it a lot more .
<Sync time="71.570"/>
we see this
<Sync time="72.635"/>
numerous times when
<Sync time="74.890"/>
with um
<Sync time="76.105"/>
with political parties .
<Sync time="77.830"/>
if a %hes if a child comes from a family
<Sync time="80.480"/>
that is particularly conservative or particularly liberal and punishes the other ,
<Sync time="84.735"/>
than they are much more likely to be the opposite of their parent .
<Sync time="87.800"/>
same applies with sex .
<Sync time="89.590"/>
but also , it's just that time of children's development
<Sync time="92.740"/>
and you're not going to be able to stop them
<Sync time="94.800"/>
by pretending that it doesn't exist .
<Sync time="97.290"/>
so it leads to more pregnancy and s_t_d's
<Sync time="100.700"/>
because you don't know how to use condoms
<Sync time="102.565"/>
and you're more likely to listen to trash on the internet .
<Sync time="105.240"/>
for example ,
<Sync time="106.205"/>
a lot of , like , still a major percentage of women ,
<Sync time="109.310"/>
or high school students ,
<Sync time="111.000"/>
believe that if you douche with soda water after you have sex
<Sync time="114.150"/>
this means you're not going to get pregnant .
<Sync time="116.080"/>
in reality ,
<Sync time="116.910"/>
all this means is that you're going to have a yeast infection
<Sync time="119.515"/>
and you didn't use a condom ,
<Sync time="121.050"/>
so you're also more likely to get pregnant .
<Sync time="123.410"/>
this is also why you end up with large amounts of outbreaks of s_t_d's , because when you don't teach people about the importance of condoms ,
<Sync time="129.600"/>
they're much more likely to get %unclear into not using them by their partner .
<Sync time="133.670"/>
our second area of clash has to do with why this propagates problematic and often sexist norms .
<Sync time="138.730"/>
when you're teaching abstinence only ,
<Sync time="140.485"/>
you're automatically saying that it i-
<Sync time="142.225"/>
that abstinence is good and correct ,
<Sync time="144.765"/>
and then having sex is wrong .
<Sync time="147.050"/>
this propagates the stigma
<Sync time="148.530"/>
that if you are someone who does have sex , regardless of the message that your school is sending ,
<Sync time="152.430"/>
you are automatically someone who is bad ,
<Sync time="154.510"/>
or someone who is behaving in an improper manner .
<Sync time="157.220"/>

<Sync time="158.430"/>
this usually targets women because if you're pregnant ,
<Sync time="161.390"/>
then that is like a direct showing of the fact that you had sex ,
<Sync time="164.580"/>
but also because women are often seen as those who are instigators or distracting men .
<Sync time="169.285"/>
this is incredibly problematic , given that your
<Sync time="172.240"/>
value as a human being
<Sync time="173.820"/>
probably shouldn't be defined by what you do with your body ,
<Sync time="176.850"/>
but rather perhaps who you are as a person , what you've accomplished in your life ,
<Sync time="180.890"/>
etcetera etcetera .
<Sync time="182.230"/>
any other metric besides what you've done before .
<Sync time="185.640"/>
our third area of clash has to do with why it disregards
<Sync time="188.570"/>
the pleasurable aspect of sex ,
<Sync time="190.440"/>
and leaves people with long term
<Sync time="193.450"/>
um misunderstanding
<Sync time="194.945"/>
of sexu- of sexuality in general .
<Sync time="197.205"/>
if you never get to talking about the actual act of sex because you're busy preaching abstinence ,
<Sync time="202.430"/>
you never explain
<Sync time="203.440"/>
consent ,
<Sync time="204.220"/>
the clitoris ,
<Sync time="205.040"/>
etcetera .
<Sync time="205.795"/>
this means kids rely on stereotypes of sex ,
<Sync time="208.590"/>
oftentimes these are male centric . the concept of
<Sync time="211.290"/>
a one orgasm being at the end of sex ,
<Sync time="214.010"/>
even though for women these often last a lot longer ,
<Sync time="216.530"/>
or often take a lot longer than what it takes for a man .
<Sync time="219.335"/>
you don't learn about
<Sync time="221.185"/>
the basic parts of your bodies , which makes
<Sync time="223.330"/>
both genders a lot less likely to enjoy themselves ,
<Sync time="226.330"/>
but you also don't value yourself as much
<Sync time="228.880"/>
when you are taught your whole life that the other person
<Sync time="231.480"/>
is more important than you .
<Sync time="232.930"/>
so you're much less likely to have healthy relationships built on mutual consent ,
<Sync time="237.215"/>
and much more likely for both genders to end up in situations where they feel pressured to do something
<Sync time="241.720"/>
and feel bad about saying no . for these reasons proud to oppose .
<Sync time="247.870"/>
