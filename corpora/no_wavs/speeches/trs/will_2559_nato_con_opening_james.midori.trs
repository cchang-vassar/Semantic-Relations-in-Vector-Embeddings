i'm proud to oppose the motion that we should disband nato .
<Sync time="4.020"/>
our first independent point is that it provides a check against russia .
<Sync time="8.750"/>
so specifically we think that this is important because
<Sync time="11.615"/>
the like the
<Sync time="12.710"/>
way that russia
<Sync time="13.940"/>
acts in the uh you know
<Sync time="15.580"/>
modern geo-political system
<Sync time="17.700"/>
is intensely aggressive .
<Sync time="19.955"/>
even if the u_s_s_r has collapsed and as you know
<Sync time="22.840"/>
ceased to exist ,
<Sync time="24.070"/>
there is still a lot of belligerence coming from that part of the world that is necessary to beat back .
<Sync time="29.340"/>
i think uh you know the recent annexation of crimea is certainly a key example of this
<Sync time="34.390"/>
um but even just sort of like broader aggression towards like other neighbors , like
<Sync time="39.125"/>
meddling in georgia's elections for example ,
<Sync time="42.120"/>
has demonstrated that russia is um you know a particularly problematic actor .
<Sync time="46.710"/>
this then in turn means that there is an active need to provide a check against that russian aggression .
<Sync time="51.905"/>
that
<Sync time="52.420"/>
if you assume that this is like a actually dangerous actor on an international scale and that they are complicit in significant human rights abuses ,
<Sync time="61.080"/>
sovereignty infringements within the region ,
<Sync time="63.440"/>
there's an active need to create a unified front against it .
<Sync time="66.510"/>
gov takes issue with the fact that nato is probably overkill ,
<Sync time="69.930"/>
we specifically think that nato being overkill is its greatest attribute .
<Sync time="74.075"/>
that is that the best way to ensure that russia doesn't %hes act
<Sync time="77.385"/>
even more aggressively
<Sync time="79.140"/>
is to actively deter it from acting aggressively .
<Sync time="82.225"/>
so if you essentially just tell them , look we've got the fire power and the unified front to just beat you into the ground if you try anything really egregious ,
<Sync time="90.740"/>
we think that that then means that russia is
<Sync time="93.250"/>
unlikely to try any extremely significant human rights abuses or
<Sync time="98.030"/>
sovereignty infringements 
<Sync time="99.495"/>
or anything like that .
<Sync time="101.590"/>
our second independent point is that nato forces unity in military action
<Sync time="106.040"/>
amongst western nations .
<Sync time="107.860"/>
so
<Sync time="108.330"/>
we think that this is really important because
<Sync time="110.975"/>
the
<Sync time="112.060"/>
alternative to nato
<Sync time="113.695"/>
is a world in which you kind of have like
<Sync time="115.850"/>
a bunch of loose cannons on the international system ,
<Sync time="119.310"/>
particularly the u_s which is known for its um
<Sync time="122.240"/>
aggression and its interventionist foreign policy ,
<Sync time="125.235"/>
is like
<Sync time="126.160"/>
really important to keep in check .
<Sync time="128.650"/>
nato ensures that there's a
<Sync time="130.215"/>
voting bloc of countries that have to come together and make decisions .
<Sync time="134.760"/>
sort of like the two heads are better than one scenari- uh
<Sync time="137.850"/>
type philosophy .
<Sync time="139.340"/>
so we think then that when there are lots of um
<Sync time="142.130"/>
individual countries making these decisions together ,
<Sync time="145.580"/>
it's more likely that these are going to be cool ,
<Sync time="147.890"/>
level headed , well thought out discussions
<Sync time="150.635"/>
rather than just tainted by some countries like personal nationalist bias or whatever .
<Sync time="155.650"/>
but beyond this ,
<Sync time="157.025"/>
we think that there's importance to the unity in action because it ensures that there's consistency across country lines .
<Sync time="163.230"/>
we think one of the worst ways to deal with an international crisis
<Sync time="166.920"/>
is an inconsistent response ,
<Sync time="169.065"/>
that is different countries respond differently .
<Sync time="171.790"/>
because then we think that aggressors can essentially play these countries
<Sync time="175.160"/>
off of one another .
<Sync time="176.500"/>
think of , for example , the inconsistent responses to
<Sync time="179.795"/>
i don't know hitler's early aggression in world war two .
<Sync time="182.660"/>
this is a prime example of when the geopolitical response was poor
<Sync time="186.835"/>
and this enabled the aggressor to get away away with um
<Sync time="189.935"/>
a lot of like territory grabbing and other aggressive moves
<Sync time="193.345"/>
that normally should not have occurred .
<Sync time="195.520"/>
as such then , we think that a unified front
<Sync time="197.800"/>
ensures that there will be a consistent ,
<Sync time="199.800"/>
clear response
<Sync time="201.190"/>
that will mitigate the likelihood of something like this happening .
<Sync time="203.990"/>
our third point is that ,
<Sync time="206.050"/>
contrary to the assertions of side government ,
<Sync time="208.500"/>
nato is a fairly equitable organization .
<Sync time="211.110"/>
i think it's interesting that like gov tells you , oh this system's
<Sync time="213.194"/>
really unfair to the united states because no one else is paying enough ,
<Sync time="218.580"/>
then also it's really unfair to everyone else because the united states is like the only
<Sync time="221.915"/>
p- place that actually benefits from this system .
<Sync time="224.740"/>
like obviously one of these just justifies the other .
<Sync time="228.305"/>
then if only the united states benefits from this
<Sync time="231.660"/>
then it's just like totally reasonable for the united states to pay a lot more money into the system than the other states .
<Sync time="237.880"/>
at that point then i think this system is pretty good at
<Sync time="240.340"/>
tracking the comparative value that these countries get out of the
<Sync time="243.940"/>
um
<Sync time="244.430"/>
actual organization . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="247.430"/>
