we should not ban
<Sync time="2.260"/>
anonymous posting online .
<Sync time="4.610"/>
three arguments for our side :
<Sync time="6.710"/>
the first is about freedom of speech .
<Sync time="8.920"/>
we think that ultimately ,
<Sync time="10.240"/>
people in almost every country in the world
<Sync time="12.690"/>
are guaranteed the ability to speak their mind .
<Sync time="15.295"/>
when you require someone to attach their name and face ,
<Sync time="19.350"/>
such as by linking s- every comment that people make to a facebook profile or something similar
<Sync time="23.870"/>
to online comments ,
<Sync time="25.345"/>
you abridge that freedom of speech .
<Sync time="27.805"/>
we see that this is already acknowledged by courts around the world
<Sync time="31.390"/>
to the point that doxing - the practice of releasing someone's personal information without their permission -
<Sync time="36.840"/>
is a crime
<Sync time="37.850"/>
or has been banned in many jurisdictions .
<Sync time="40.535"/>
the reason why this limits people's freedom of speech so much
<Sync time="44.225"/>
is because by attaching your identity to something you open yourself up to attack .
<Sync time="48.675"/>
this means that people will be afraid to speak their mind ,
<Sync time="51.350"/>
more on this in just a minute ,
<Sync time="52.690"/>
and that people won't be able to access the kinds of open fora
<Sync time="56.420"/>
that characterized the internet right now .
<Sync time="58.670"/>
we think that one of the best things about the internet now is anonymous posting , because it lets people have conversations that otherwise wouldn't exist .
<Sync time="66.020"/>
so you silence a tremendous amount of speech
<Sync time="68.405"/>
by banning
<Sync time="69.315"/>
this anonymous posting .
<Sync time="70.910"/>
and the other side might tell you that it isn't speech that we want . that it's online bullying or people behaving anti-socially ,
<Sync time="77.335"/>
but i don't think they can make that claim categorically that this never has value , for reasons i'll explain now .
<Sync time="82.815"/>
our second argument is about the benefits of anonymous posting to closeted or otherwise marginalized communities .
<Sync time="90.080"/>
imagine that you are gay
<Sync time="92.080"/>
in iran .
<Sync time="93.450"/>
how are you supposed to talk about your experiences with like minded individuals without anonymous posting ?
<Sync time="99.265"/>
we tell you that ultimately people whose ideas are not accepted by wider society 
<Sync time="104.180"/>
or whose identities are not accepted but wider society ,
<Sync time="107.510"/>
benefit enormously from online posting .
<Sync time="110.485"/>
i think one reason why there are so many more people with diverse identities
<Sync time="115.110"/>
out in the open today than there were thirty years ago ,
<Sync time="118.350"/>
is that people can find community online in a way that they can't
<Sync time="121.880"/>
in person .
<Sync time="123.130"/>
people don't feel comfortable talking about things like sexuality or gender identity
<Sync time="127.280"/>
if they live in a conservative country
<Sync time="129.230"/>
or a conservative area of a country ,
<Sync time="131.520"/>
so they don't have a community to access .
<Sync time="134.490"/>
anonymous posting lets people safely talk about identities that are marginalized
<Sync time="139.120"/>
or discriminated against .
<Sync time="140.800"/>
it lets people who otherwise lack community , create community .
<Sync time="144.575"/>
and this eventually spills over into the real world .
<Sync time="147.600"/>
when people realize that they are not alone ,
<Sync time="149.700"/>
that other people have the same experiences as them ,
<Sync time="152.260"/>
that what they are feeling is okay and not something that should be , they should be ashamed of ,
<Sync time="156.650"/>
than they are much more likely to be able to come forward and talk about those ideas
<Sync time="160.215"/>
in public .
<Sync time="161.320"/>
we think that
<Sync time="161.860"/>
anonymous posting and anonymous communities
<Sync time="164.470"/>
ultimately beget
<Sync time="165.690"/>
real world communities which then can advocate for social change
<Sync time="169.180"/>
and acceptance .
<Sync time="170.670"/>
now the other team is going to say 
<Sync time="172.785"/>
it's not just gay kids using the internet . it's also people like the far right 
<Sync time="177.340"/>
or political activists who want harmful things or isis
<Sync time="181.460"/>
or groups like that .
<Sync time="183.030"/>
but those people
<Sync time="183.880"/>
already existed anyway just like gay people already existed .
<Sync time="187.210"/>
so you don't get rid of isis , you don't get rid of neo-nazis by banning anonymous posting .
<Sync time="192.405"/>
and for reasons i'll j- explain in just a minute , you don't even limit their activity by banning this kind of ac-
<Sync time="197.330"/>
uh posting .
<Sync time="198.315"/>
so we think that ultimately the benefits that accrue to marginalized groups
<Sync time="202.090"/>
greatly outweigh the harms caused by isis posting on twitter occasionally .
<Sync time="206.815"/>

<Sync time="207.550"/>
our final argument is that these laws would be unenforceable if they were introduced .
<Sync time="212.550"/>
there is no way that any one country can implement
<Sync time="215.490"/>
an end to anonymous posting .
<Sync time="217.480"/>
even china , with their attempts to cut off their internet from the rest of the world ,
<Sync time="221.540"/>
had been unable to stop people from using
<Sync time="223.995"/>
i_p_n's or other
<Sync time="225.870"/>
ways of circumventing the great firewall of china as they call it .
<Sync time="229.750"/>
the nature of the internet is that no one country can regulate it .
<Sync time="233.460"/>
so ultimately as long as people can set up an anonymous server in
<Sync time="236.855"/>
tuvalu or some other tiny country ,
<Sync time="239.225"/>
you won't be able to enforce this laws .
<Sync time="241.260"/>
which makes your government look weak and foolish and ultimately reduces the respect that people have for it .
<Sync time="247.180"/>
we tell you that the kinds of extremist you might want to stop from talking online are still able to do so therefore ,
<Sync time="252.870"/>
so there's no
<Sync time="254.000"/>
successful effect of this policy .
<Sync time="256.220"/>
for all these reasons we should not ban anonymous posting .
<Sync time="259.390"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="260.409"/>
