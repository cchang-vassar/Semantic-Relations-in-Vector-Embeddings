we should introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="3.400"/>
in the status quo the majority of income taxes
<Sync time="6.280"/>
in western liberal democracies
<Sync time="7.875"/>
are progressive taxes
<Sync time="9.290"/>
that disproportionately tax wealthy earners
<Sync time="11.820"/>
and take their money
<Sync time="13.310"/>
even though they are the people that are least likely to take government services .
<Sync time="16.855"/>
for this reason we would propose
<Sync time="18.990"/>
that the states or that states
<Sync time="20.980"/>
introduce an income tax that is a flat tax
<Sync time="23.585"/>
that ensures that all people that are capable of paying taxes were not going to eliminate
<Sync time="27.905"/>
a minimum
<Sync time="28.560"/>
earnings limit that allows you to have a taxable income because we think
<Sync time="31.895"/>
that certain people simply cannot pay taxes because of the situation they're in .
<Sync time="35.630"/>
but in instances in which people
<Sync time="37.185"/>
can afford to pay taxes ,
<Sync time="38.830"/>
all people have to pay
<Sync time="40.195"/>
the same proportion of their income
<Sync time="42.490"/>
into the government .
<Sync time="43.300"/>
so we think
<Sync time="44.645"/>
that it's essential that this occurs because
<Sync time="47.460"/>
recognize that all individuals
<Sync time="49.510"/>
are exist under a coercive apparatus of the state . no matter how wealthy one is or how poor one is ,
<Sync time="54.390"/>
all people have been forced into the state by circumstances
<Sync time="57.610"/>
of where they were born
<Sync time="58.800"/>
or because of where they had to uh
<Sync time="60.780"/>
go to live for jobs
<Sync time="62.520"/>
or other types of social reasons . no one
<Sync time="64.390"/>
entirely freely chooses to be within the state ,
<Sync time="66.755"/>
and even if they did
<Sync time="67.820"/>
the state cannot simply , because of consent , choose to abuse its people .
<Sync time="71.410"/>
the state can only be justified , can only exist in a just way , if
<Sync time="74.920"/>
it serves to benefit all of its people .
<Sync time="77.580"/>
this means
<Sync time="78.330"/>
that the state has an equal burden to all citizens ,
<Sync time="81.240"/>
even if certain citizens ,
<Sync time="82.665"/>
through their own free power and capabilities , are able to earn more within the state apparatus
<Sync time="87.740"/>
then other individuals .
<Sync time="89.350"/>
what we think this means is that
<Sync time="90.760"/>
when you have other systems of taxation such as a progressive tax ,
<Sync time="94.400"/>
you choose to ignore the claims of representation
<Sync time="97.050"/>
that certain members
<Sync time="98.165"/>
of your constituency have . and it means that you're saying
<Sync time="101.130"/>
that the freedom
<Sync time="102.230"/>
of property the freedom to accumulate property and accumulate wealth
<Sync time="105.650"/>
is different
<Sync time="106.500"/>
once you get richer . it says that the humanity
<Sync time="108.830"/>
and the claims you have to
<Sync time="110.100"/>
ownership
<Sync time="110.775"/>
are diluted when you are a more wealthy human being .
<Sync time="113.710"/>
and it's more important to recognize that
<Sync time="115.560"/>
the vast majority of wealthy individuals
<Sync time="117.845"/>
in western liberal democracies are not individuals
<Sync time="120.385"/>
that are taking the types of social benefits
<Sync time="122.595"/>
that taxes go to pay . they pay into certain things
<Sync time="125.545"/>
that they're simply never going to use . things like welfare benefits , things like social security ,
<Sync time="130.350"/>
these are things that wealthy individuals are forced to pay into
<Sync time="133.330"/>
but gain little benefit from .
<Sync time="135.060"/>
yes , it's true that these individuals gain benefit from
<Sync time="137.380"/>
infrastructure , protection from the army , all these things just as everyone else does ,
<Sync time="141.540"/>
but it is the case that these individuals
<Sync time="143.570"/>
simply are not getting as much out of the government directly
<Sync time="146.725"/>
as poor individuals 
<Sync time="148.260"/>
are . what this means is that it is unfair ,
<Sync time="151.060"/>
principally , to force these people to pay more
<Sync time="153.745"/>
and that when you have progressive taxes
<Sync time="156.080"/>
it allows for drastic spending to take place
<Sync time="158.570"/>
because it because constituencies and a base of people
<Sync time="161.935"/>
in the public
<Sync time="162.985"/>
know that they will not be the ones that have to bear the burden ,
<Sync time="165.970"/>
the spending burden , that increased government spending
<Sync time="168.890"/>
costs . we think that if you're going to institute no new government programs
<Sync time="173.300"/>
if you're going to pre- place more coercive power
<Sync time="175.925"/>
into state hands , if you're going to ensure that the state
<Sync time="178.560"/>
is more capable of taking from the people within the state and stealing the property that they have earned ,
<Sync time="183.855"/>
it is important that all people
<Sync time="185.900"/>
bear the ramifications of this
<Sync time="188.070"/>
equally . yes it is the case that
<Sync time="190.400"/>
less uh
<Sync time="190.920"/>
less wealthy individuals
<Sync time="192.385"/>
have less disposable income at their uh
<Sync time="194.345"/>
at their disposal
<Sync time="195.590"/>
but this doesn't mean that their claims to ownership change
<Sync time="198.295"/>
because of the quantity of ownership that you have .
<Sync time="200.670"/>
rather claims of ownership matter
<Sync time="202.360"/>
because of the importance of valuing property
<Sync time="204.895"/>
in a broad and principled manner .
<Sync time="206.880"/>
we think that flat taxes
<Sync time="208.755"/>
to the best job of representing that
<Sync time="210.660"/>
and flat taxes do the best job of ensuring
<Sync time="212.875"/>
that not only do all people bear the same burden ,
<Sync time="215.310"/>
but all people are given the same level
<Sync time="217.425"/>
of right to property
<Sync time="218.620"/>
as anyone else . in the status quo 
<Sync time="220.760"/>
there's a system that allows spending to run wild in the government level
<Sync time="224.080"/>
with the burden being pushed
<Sync time="225.590"/>
dramatically
<Sync time="226.370"/>
on a small segment of society .
<Sync time="228.185"/>
that burden isn't fair 
<Sync time="229.640"/>
given the responsibility the state has to all citizens
<Sync time="232.450"/>
and the conception that the state
<Sync time="234.140"/>
serves to serve uh
<Sync time="235.250"/>
exists to serve all .
<Sync time="236.725"/>
given this we should introduce a flat tax .
<Sync time="239.900"/>
