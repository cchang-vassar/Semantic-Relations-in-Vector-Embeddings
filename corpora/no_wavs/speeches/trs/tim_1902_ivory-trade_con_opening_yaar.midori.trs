we should not legalize ivory trade .
<Sync time="2.845"/>
in the status quo there is an issue ,
<Sync time="4.850"/>
a major issue that faces
<Sync time="6.280"/>
rhinos and elephants of different species
<Sync time="8.720"/>
in that many
<Sync time="9.770"/>
elephant and rhino species are going extinct . 
<Sync time="12.435"/>
the reason for this is that
<Sync time="13.670"/>
ivory is an incredibly valuable asset and an incredibly valuable resource
<Sync time="18.005"/>
in many countries seen
<Sync time="19.590"/>
for both uh
<Sync time="20.790"/>
communal uses , for medical uses uh of different types in different sort of homeopathic remedies ,
<Sync time="26.000"/>
but also just for the value of the material itself
<Sync time="28.800"/>
uh
<Sync time="29.410"/>
for jewelry and things like this . so ivory's incredibly valuable on the world market
<Sync time="33.355"/>
and it has led to a dramatic decline in
<Sync time="35.620"/>
elephant and rhino populations . which is actually very important for those species in particular
<Sync time="39.925"/>
because the breeding periods i know of
<Sync time="41.450"/>
elephants
<Sync time="42.125"/>
is a very long time , and for rhinos
<Sync time="44.122"/>
it's similarly long , the gestation
<Sync time="45.790"/>
uh it takes a long time for populations of these types of species to grow back . so when these species are endangered ,
<Sync time="51.890"/>
it makes it even more likely that they could go extinct in the future .
<Sync time="54.920"/>
so firstly we're going to talk about animal rights
<Sync time="57.015"/>
and why uh
<Sync time="58.070"/>
yet
<Sync time="58.350"/>
animals deserve rights and why uh
<Sync time="60.905"/>
and why this is so crucial
<Sync time="63.360"/>
uh about legalizing ivory trade . why it would be bad for those respects . so why do animals deserve rights ?
<Sync time="68.685"/>
we think in order for rights to be effective ,
<Sync time="71.230"/>
they need to be objective . that is
<Sync time="73.080"/>
in order for a system of rights to be coherent and to
<Sync time="76.110"/>
protect in a way that is
<Sync time="77.410"/>
unbiased and isn't
<Sync time="78.630"/>
perspectival , which means it protects broadly
<Sync time="81.585"/>
no matter what the perspective is that you're taking ,
<Sync time="84.345"/>
uh it allows that we can make objective judgments about right and wrong .
<Sync time="87.720"/>
in order for this to be
<Sync time="88.990"/>
to be the case , there needs to be some sort of
<Sync time="90.945"/>
foundation on which these rights exist .
<Sync time="93.700"/>
and it can't simply be humanity unless we give good reasons
<Sync time="97.125"/>
why humanity is the line that needs to be drawn
<Sync time="100.030"/>
for giving rights . but we think that this is rather uh
<Sync time="102.485"/>
rather subjective
<Sync time="103.890"/>
in that we're only giving it to humans because we are humans . there isn't on
<Sync time="107.570"/>
any other basis besides that .
<Sync time="109.520"/>
uh we think that a much better reason to give rights is on the basis of pain and pleasure .
<Sync time="114.190"/>
the reason for this is that rights
<Sync time="115.900"/>
ultimately come down to trying to minimize pain
<Sync time="118.520"/>
and enact more pleasure . when we talk about rights to life , rights to speech ,
<Sync time="122.470"/>
rights to bodily autonomy ,
<Sync time="123.900"/>
all these are for reasons of trying to minimize pain when you get to the very bottom of it , when you ask why is it important to protect these rights ?
<Sync time="130.710"/>
you enter into an infinite regress of answers until it comes to that simple point . 
<Sync time="135.030"/>
in given that that's what we're trying to do with rights , we should give it on the basis
<Sync time="138.630"/>
of whether or not these things can feel pain and pleasure . and in the instance of animals that produce ivory ,
<Sync time="144.270"/>
the answer is resoundingly yes . these animals can not only
<Sync time="147.635"/>
experience pain or pleasure ,
<Sync time="149.310"/>
but also have human like emotions . they can experience sadness ,
<Sync time="152.705"/>
they can know that
<Sync time="154.000"/>
a threat is coming and respond to it , they can experience
<Sync time="156.670"/>
fear ,
<Sync time="157.180"/>
all of these types of things that we would say are human
<Sync time="160.240"/>
are ex- uh experiences and emotions that these animals can have . 
<Sync time="163.580"/>
so even if you think
<Sync time="164.870"/>
that pain and pleasure isn't the basis , if you think it's consciousness ,
<Sync time="168.225"/>
or things like this , the ability to have human like interactions ,
<Sync time="171.590"/>
these animals often form human like communities with hierarchies
<Sync time="174.950"/>
and different types
<Sync time="175.970"/>
of social understandings between groups , even if they're not advanced .
<Sync time="179.285"/>
so we clearly think that animals ,
<Sync time="181.275"/>
especially elephants and rhinos , advanced
<Sync time="183.480"/>
intelligent animals , deserve rights .
<Sync time="185.575"/>
the problem with this is that if you legalize the ivory trade ,
<Sync time="188.470"/>
you are almost certainly going to ensure
<Sync time="190.480"/>
that there's an expansion in hunting .
<Sync time="192.545"/>
uh when it's legalized to hunt these animals , when it's legalize to trade these types of things ,
<Sync time="197.060"/>
even if you don't legalize the hunting itself ,
<Sync time="199.205"/>
it means that sport is going to become far more common and it's already very difficult
<Sync time="203.395"/>
to look at these uh to
<Sync time="204.980"/>
observe
<Sync time="205.640"/>
and protect these animals from these things because of the wide areas in which these animals
<Sync time="209.730"/>
uh may roam and the ability
<Sync time="211.620"/>
for hunters to go undetected . it's difficult to regulate these things and u- when the black market can operate
<Sync time="216.780"/>
in the open , it means that it's easier to get these types of s-
<Sync time="219.630"/>
uh these types of goods , but it also means that there's
<Sync time="222.075"/>
a greater demand for these goods . so even if it can be
<Sync time="225.165"/>
uh
<Sync time="225.775"/>
uh better observed and better monitored if you bring it into a legal market ,
<Sync time="229.715"/>
it means that
<Sync time="230.590"/>
the demands for these goods is going to go up so dramatically that you're almost certainly going to see uh uh
<Sync time="235.060"/>
hunters and poachers
<Sync time="236.600"/>
attack these uh the these animals in new numbers .
<Sync time="239.210"/>
given that these animals deserve the right to life
<Sync time="241.590"/>
based on the principles of pain and pleasure ,
<Sync time="244.180"/>
we don't think that you should legalize the ivory trade ,
<Sync time="246.595"/>
because it would ultimately lead
<Sync time="248.300"/>
almost certainly to their extinction .
<Sync time="250.590"/>
and given all this we should not legalize
<Sync time="253.395"/>
the ivory trade .
<Sync time="254.610"/>
