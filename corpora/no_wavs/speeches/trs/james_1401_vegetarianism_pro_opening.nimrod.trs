we should adopt to vegetarianism .
<Sync time="3.010"/>
so , this is a debate
<Sync time="4.420"/>
saying that individual people
<Sync time="6.605"/>
have an obligation to become vegetarians , to swear off
<Sync time="10.450"/>
eating meat , and other animal products .
<Sync time="13.430"/>
so with that in mind , we have
<Sync time="15.315"/>
two main arguments for you :
<Sync time="16.930"/>
the first is about the rights of animals .
<Sync time="19.610"/>
we're going to tell you that , animals are worthy of moral consideration , and that it is unethical to eat them for this reason .
<Sync time="26.235"/>

<Sync time="26.850"/>
recognize that , any moral distinction between animals and humans will always be arbitrary .
<Sync time="32.330"/>
many people might say that humans deserve more consideration than animals , because they're more intelligent ,
<Sync time="36.975"/>
but this clearly isn't always true . we see that ,
<Sync time="39.525"/>
an adult dolphin , for instance , is much more able than a baby human
<Sync time="43.650"/>
to make certain decisions .
<Sync time="45.300"/>
the other side might retort that , no one eats dolphins , but the point is that
<Sync time="48.525"/>
we do eat animals that are very intelligent , like octopus ,
<Sync time="51.815"/>
and that on top of that ,
<Sync time="53.600"/>
all animals clearly would prefer not to be in pain , rather than to be in pain .
<Sync time="58.250"/>
we think that , this is indicative of some level of intelligence , and that we ought to respect these wishes .
<Sync time="63.075"/>
in the same way that we don't force people to do things , that make them uncomfortable whenever possible ,
<Sync time="68.100"/>
we view those as moral harms , we ought not force
<Sync time="70.410"/>
animals to do these things .
<Sync time="72.290"/>
and recognize that , it's not just the act of
<Sync time="74.190"/>
eating the animal 
<Sync time="75.480"/>
that causes so much suffering . we think that ,
<Sync time="77.905"/>
you know oftentimes it's possible to kill an animal painlessly , so they don't understand what's going on .
<Sync time="82.550"/>
but the industry that supports the creation of meat , for our consumption , is deeply unethical .
<Sync time="89.050"/>
we see that ,
<Sync time="89.725"/>
you have chickens who were born into tiny cages , that are barely larger than they are ,
<Sync time="94.475"/>
and then kept in dark buildings for their entire lives .
<Sync time="97.530"/>
they grow so fat , that they can't
<Sync time="99.350"/>
walk around , and that are pumped full of chemicals , which
<Sync time="102.475"/>
prevent them from developing in- in a normal way .
<Sync time="105.255"/>
we think that , it's
<Sync time="106.450"/>
extremely troubling that society is completely willing to overlook
<Sync time="110.210"/>
the horrifying , frankly , treatment of animals in the meat industry ,
<Sync time="114.495"/>
in order to continue to satisfy a basic human instinct to eat meat .
<Sync time="118.740"/>
we think that , people have an obligation to
<Sync time="120.790"/>
overcome these baser instincts , in order to respect the moral considerations of others ,
<Sync time="125.430"/>
even if those others have hooves or feathers .
<Sync time="128.590"/>
so because animals are deserving of moral consideration , because they're living things with preferences ,
<Sync time="133.990"/>
we should become vegetarians , rather than continue to exploit them .
<Sync time="138.120"/>
our second argument ,
<Sync time="139.270"/>
even if you don't care about animals ,
<Sync time="141.030"/>
is about
<Sync time="141.605"/>
the environment , and i think it's clear that if you care about human beings as moral actors , that you'll care about this .
<Sync time="147.385"/>

<Sync time="148.880"/>
realize that ,
<Sync time="150.400"/>
the production of meat is tremendously resource intensive .
<Sync time="154.600"/>

<Sync time="155.220"/>
if you imagine a big pyramid , and let's say that there's
<Sync time="158.195"/>
a million calories worth of corn at the bottom of the pyramid ,
<Sync time="162.390"/>
so ,
<Sync time="162.855"/>
corn plants produce a million calories worth of
<Sync time="165.755"/>
food .
<Sync time="166.960"/>
every time you go up a level of the food chain ,
<Sync time="170.340"/>
ninety percent of those calories are lost . so , we go from
<Sync time="173.825"/>
a million levels at the bottom , to a hundred
<Sync time="176.900"/>
thousand calories , at the next level , at the cow level ,
<Sync time="180.690"/>
to ten thousand calories
<Sync time="183.085"/>
at the human level . that's all humans are receiving is ten thousand , because ninety percent of the calories are lost at every level ,
<Sync time="189.380"/>
because digestion is inefficient , and because
<Sync time="191.940"/>
animals and plants consume a certain amount of calories as you move up
<Sync time="195.520"/>
the food chain .
<Sync time="196.870"/>
so what we see is that , whereas you could feed
<Sync time="198.765"/>
ten times as many people ,
<Sync time="200.780"/>
with an acre of land producing corn for human consumption ,
<Sync time="204.610"/>
you feed
<Sync time="205.345"/>
only one tenth as many ,
<Sync time="206.895"/>
if an acre of land is devoted to corn
<Sync time="208.965"/>
for cattle's consumption .
<Sync time="210.690"/>
so ultimately , we think that in a world where people are starving ,
<Sync time="214.060"/>
in a world where too much land is devoted to agriculture ,
<Sync time="217.260"/>
and it's destroying our environment , that it is deeply unethical
<Sync time="220.585"/>
for posterity , and for people starving right now ,
<Sync time="223.930"/>
to eat meat .
<Sync time="225.020"/>
but , we also see that the environmental degradation , caused by the monoculture of corn
<Sync time="230.225"/>
and crops used to feed the livestock ,
<Sync time="232.860"/>
is deeply devastating for the environment , and is causing irreversible damage ,
<Sync time="237.190"/>
which means that future people , who we think deserve equal consideration
<Sync time="240.850"/>
with current people , are going to live in a worse environment , so that we can eat chicken nuggets .
<Sync time="245.690"/>
for these reasons ,
<Sync time="246.945"/>
we should adopt vegetarianism .
<Sync time="248.980"/>
thank you .
