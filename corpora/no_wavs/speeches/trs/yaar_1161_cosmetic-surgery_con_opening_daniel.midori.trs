we believe that
<Sync time="1.430"/>
banning cosmetic surgeries
<Sync time="3.330"/>
harm both the principle of autonomy over one's body and people's identities .
<Sync time="8.050"/>
but
<Sync time="8.350"/>
first of all we think that we should distinguish cases
<Sync time="11.205"/>
of
<Sync time="11.860"/>
true deformities or , for instance ,
<Sync time="14.750"/>
uh procedures that are meant to restore one's previous looks after he suffered an injury that resulted in some deformities .
<Sync time="21.320"/>
side government doesn't say anything to that effect .
<Sync time="24.000"/>
all they talk about is
<Sync time="25.240"/>
botox and
<Sync time="26.445"/>
like breast enhancement surgeries .
<Sync time="28.800"/>
obviously we think that that is a huge impact in the debate and a huge harm that they do not address at all .
<Sync time="34.260"/>
moving on .
<Sync time="35.240"/>
they talk about how cosmetic surgery
<Sync time="37.560"/>
enhances
<Sync time="38.485"/>
the model of beauty in all of its harms to society .
<Sync time="41.710"/>
we wonder therefore
<Sync time="42.820"/>
are they also in favor
<Sync time="44.110"/>
of banning make up , high heels ?
<Sync time="46.540"/>
what about liposuction surgeries ? what about
<Sync time="48.780"/>
going to the dentist to make your teeth whiter ?
<Sync time="51.170"/>
what about tattoos ?
<Sync time="52.260"/>
we say that all of these examples are also
<Sync time="55.050"/>
like following from the logic
<Sync time="57.320"/>
of the analysis of side government .
<Sync time="59.495"/>
moreover they talk about the financial costs and how not everyone can afford it and those who do
<Sync time="64.790"/>
who are able to afford it
<Sync time="66.255"/>
n- need to spend a fortune on it .
<Sync time="67.880"/>
obviously this is true to so many things that it would be impossible to even count .
<Sync time="72.030"/>
people spend a fortune on designer clothes , on fancy cars ,
<Sync time="75.110"/>
in ways that don't make any sense ,
<Sync time="77.450"/>
other like but for the fact
<Sync time="79.020"/>
that this is some s- sort some sort
<Sync time="80.770"/>
of like a
<Sync time="82.400"/>
status that gives them
<Sync time="84.890"/>
um like social capital . 
<Sync time="87.590"/>
now that too is
<Sync time="89.355"/>
is based on social norms that aren't necessarily rational but we do not think that the government can even imagine
<Sync time="96.640"/>
saying
<Sync time="97.320"/>
that because this is expensive and some people can't afford this
<Sync time="100.875"/>
this is a good enough reason in order to ban
<Sync time="103.260"/>
access to all of these things all together . 
<Sync time="105.500"/>
onto the constructive :
<Sync time="107.205"/>
we say that even if there is
<Sync time="109.210"/>
truth to the ideal
<Sync time="111.160"/>
of the government ,
<Sync time="112.310"/>
they have to explain , they have the burden to explain why they think that it's legitimate
<Sync time="116.820"/>
to force a lot of people to suffer through a miserable life in which they feel
<Sync time="121.550"/>
very much
<Sync time="122.090"/>
uncomfortable in their own skins
<Sync time="123.640"/>
in order to serve this ideal .
<Sync time="125.640"/>
say that i was born with the disfigurement of
<Sync time="127.980"/>
some sort ,
<Sync time="128.920"/>
that makes me ashamed or insecure ,
<Sync time="131.395"/>
now even if in a perfect world this shouldn't have bothered me .
<Sync time="135.260"/>
the fact is that we don't live in a perfect world and the government doesn't
<Sync time="139.130"/>
really give us any
<Sync time="140.405"/>
type of convincing mechanism to believe
<Sync time="143.120"/>
that
<Sync time="143.650"/>
in a world without cosmetic surgeries this thing is going to change drastically and that people would stop judging each other
<Sync time="149.600"/>
according
<Sync time="150.630"/>
like based on how they look .
<Sync time="152.430"/>
so why should i pay the price for that ? it's not my fault .
<Sync time="156.490"/>
we say that a person's look
<Sync time="158.065"/>
is a and like
<Sync time="160.065"/>
a very
<Sync time="161.020"/>
basic element in his identity .
<Sync time="164.050"/>
it's out in the open , it's the first thing that people notice about you .
<Sync time="167.130"/>
whether we like it or not , 
<Sync time="168.380"/>
our appearance
<Sync time="169.390"/>
deeply affects our life .
<Sync time="171.080"/>
the options that we're going to have , the type of connections that we're going to make
<Sync time="174.660"/>
with other people ,
<Sync time="175.690"/>
now
<Sync time="176.450"/>
it can be argued that
<Sync time="177.970"/>
this has become too extreme because of the model of beauty
<Sync time="181.810"/>
but that's a reality that is unlikely going to change because people are just programmed by nature
<Sync time="187.520"/>
to be attracted to
<Sync time="189.250"/>
or to be
<Sync time="190.630"/>
like not attracted to
<Sync time="192.280"/>
people based on their appearance .
<Sync time="194.340"/>
for all of these reasons we say that most people
<Sync time="196.655"/>
are concerned
<Sync time="197.980"/>
about ha- how they look and they want to look as good
<Sync time="200.900"/>
as they can . so
<Sync time="202.490"/>
we say that when a
<Sync time="203.495"/>
person is unhappy with a certain feature of his appearance
<Sync time="206.860"/>
this can massively harm his his
<Sync time="209.420"/>
like feeling of self worth 
<Sync time="211.550"/>
and self confidence .
<Sync time="213.050"/>
you feel trapped in your own body and there's no escape .
<Sync time="215.990"/>
this is a feeling of shame
<Sync time="217.535"/>
that escorts you everywhere you go even when you are alone .
<Sync time="220.770"/>
every mir- mirror
<Sync time="222.090"/>
becomes your enemy .
<Sync time="223.310"/>
in fact
<Sync time="223.945"/>
we say that it's kind of like people that
<Sync time="225.890"/>
that feel that they were born to the wrong sex and the government wants to force them to continue on living this way 
<Sync time="231.950"/>
even though a solution is available .
<Sync time="234.180"/>
is the solution p-
<Sync time="235.330"/>
perfect ? are there no problems with it ?
<Sync time="237.780"/>
obviously no .
<Sync time="238.880"/>
it's a debate .
<Sync time="240.000"/>
but deciding for these people
<Sync time="242.205"/>
that are interested in it that the cost is too high for them is just incredibly
<Sync time="247.035"/>
patronizing 
<Sync time="248.055"/>
and not something
<Sync time="248.930"/>
that side government can simply decide .
<Sync time="251.065"/>
for all these reasons we beg you to oppose .
<Sync time="253.844"/>
