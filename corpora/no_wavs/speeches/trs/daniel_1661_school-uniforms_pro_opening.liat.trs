<Sync time="0.810"/>
we should ban school uniforms , because
<Sync time="3.810"/>
they ultimately have
<Sync time="5.540"/>
uh
<Sync time="6.060"/>
a good amount of uh good for the students ,
<Sync time="8.580"/>
they create good in the fact that it gives students an outlet to express their creativity , their individuality
<Sync time="14.865"/>
and their preferences ,
<Sync time="16.150"/>
and it creates good in that it allows students to just wear clothing that is
<Sync time="20.605"/>
more comfortable for them , more fitting for them , like better for them ,
<Sync time="24.250"/>
which i also
<Sync time="25.140"/>
which i think makes them like
<Sync time="26.550"/>
better students even in a lot of ways actually .
<Sync time="28.830"/>
so
<Sync time="29.725"/>
let's start by talking about um
<Sync time="32.400"/>
the first thing , the creativity .
<Sync time="34.000"/>
because i think that
<Sync time="34.975"/>
it's important that when we look at students , especially given that schools aren't p-
<Sync time="39.115"/>
purely academic atmosphere , that they have social elements to them as well .
<Sync time="42.990"/>
students want to be able to express themselves , they want to express their individuality , they want to express what they like , what they don't like , things like that .
<Sync time="49.880"/>
these are , for what it's worth and worth noting , constitutional protections that a lot of students have in places like america to express their speech in that way .
<Sync time="57.250"/>
and i think that
<Sync time="58.715"/>
there's
<Sync time="59.400"/>
like a true value to that , when everyone just wearing the same , when everyone just looks the same and i- uh is wearing the same things ,
<Sync time="64.760"/>
you don't really feel like you're able to express yourselves , you feel like one of just like a mob , and
<Sync time="69.670"/>
that's just not something that people like , and
<Sync time="72.815"/>
that's a harm already .
<Sync time="74.670"/>
the next thing i'm going to talk about , though , is about comfort .
<Sync time="77.320"/>
so , i think that just
<Sync time="78.700"/>
oftentimes school uniforms aren't particularly comfortable , they're not the kind of clothes that maybe people are comfortable in different kinds of clothing ,
<Sync time="85.560"/>
and i think that that's actually important to note , because a lot of people just work better or more able to focus when they're wearing
<Sync time="91.810"/>
things that are comfortable , like
<Sync time="93.130"/>
uh i'm much better able to work when i'm wearing pajamas than i'm wearing a suit ,
<Sync time="97.025"/>
which i think is uncomfortable , i'm better able to focus . there's
<Sync time="99.780"/>
plenty of people who feel like that , a lot of students , especially when you're younger , are very likely to
<Sync time="104.415"/>
uh have focus in this way .
<Sync time="106.730"/>
uh being comfortable is also better , you don't want to be wearing like
<Sync time="109.970"/>
like a thick thing if it's um like bothering , shorter shorts if it's sweating
<Sync time="114.360"/>
uh if it's like hot out or
<Sync time="115.500"/>
you're sweating and things like that , like
<Sync time="116.935"/>
these are basic things and uh but they are nevertheless important things .
<Sync time="120.720"/>
so , the next thing is i want to just like weigh all of that against
<Sync time="123.770"/>
the fact , compare it all to the fact that there is
<Sync time="125.845"/>
no real positive impact for uniforms .
<Sync time="128.430"/>
like first and foremost ,
<Sync time="129.760"/>
recognize that this is about
<Sync time="131.100"/>
uniforms , not dress code , so obviously a lot of the more extreme
<Sync time="135.190"/>
harms that people could talk about on the other side are not actually all that important , it's just like hyperbole .
<Sync time="141.380"/>
um but the final thing that i want to talk about , is about like a lot of the lies that are associated with other things , like
<Sync time="146.270"/>
wearing certain types of clothes is not a distraction , there's no real evidence of that ,
<Sync time="150.570"/>
wearing uh certain kind of clothing doesn't make you like
<Sync time="153.230"/>
focus any better , or um
<Sync time="155.095"/>
you get things like that .
<Sync time="156.450"/>
these are ultimately just unfounded assertions , and it shouldn't be valued very heavily .
<Sync time="159.890"/>
so , for all of those reasons , very f- proud to propose .
<Sync time="163.769"/>
