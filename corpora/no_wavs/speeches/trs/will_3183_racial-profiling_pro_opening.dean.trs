i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should increase
<Sync time="3.815"/>
racial profiling in airport security in the united states .
<Sync time="8.910"/>
three independent or two independent points .
<Sync time="10.990"/>
the first of which is simply accuracy .
<Sync time="13.705"/>
i think it is
<Sync time="14.985"/>
fairly clear from looking at you know crime records and statistical records
<Sync time="19.310"/>
that there is a strong correlation between um specific ethnic groups and uh
<Sync time="24.195"/>
like criminal activity .
<Sync time="25.680"/>
i think this is also true to an even greater extent of uh criminal activity that airports are concerned with .
<Sync time="32.090"/>
um a large number of like plane hijackings and bombings and things like that have been committed by individuals of middle eastern descent
<Sync time="40.480"/>
um and it is notable that this is not because of anything intrinsic to the race
<Sync time="44.480"/>
but rather because of just like particular parts of the world .
<Sync time="48.300"/>
the correlation with these crimes is obviously
<Sync time="50.880"/>
much stronger with the point of origin
<Sync time="53.430"/>
than it is with the actual race itself .
<Sync time="56.280"/>
nonetheless it is not actually possible to
<Sync time="59.090"/>
you know verify point of origin
<Sync time="61.260"/>
especially when you know people that are going to commit the significant crimes
<Sync time="65.540"/>
probably have falsified documents .
<Sync time="68.650"/>
given that then the next best proxy is race
<Sync time="71.800"/>
um and this is important .
<Sync time="73.410"/>
op is going to tell you that
<Sync time="75.625"/>
the the thing we should be doing is basically tracking criminal activity
<Sync time="80.100"/>
rather than tracking the race . i think the problem though is
<Sync time="83.780"/>
what we're talking about specifically when we're talking about airport terrorism
<Sync time="88.300"/>
is
<Sync time="89.060"/>
um
<Sync time="89.865"/>
is really a set of
<Sync time="91.340"/>
criminals and uh
<Sync time="92.810"/>
terrorist organizations that are so refined in tactics
<Sync time="96.350"/>
that it's not really possible just to track
<Sync time="99.785"/>
um you know indicators like
<Sync time="102.560"/>
um you know whether or not they're
<Sync time="104.410"/>
like holding water bottles or whatever
<Sync time="106.530"/>
whatever criminal patterns might you know correlate with uh
<Sync time="110.725"/>
with %hes with airport security issues .
<Sync time="113.450"/>
i think one reason for this is just the small data set , that it's difficult to build a statistical model that accurately tracks the behaviors of the airport terrorism .
<Sync time="122.410"/>
but secondly
<Sync time="124.105"/>
it's 
<Sync time="124.900"/>
%hes
<Sync time="125.130"/>
it's it's just not something that's easy to detect because of how
<Sync time="128.995"/>
you does explicitly it's designed to avoid detection .
<Sync time="132.850"/>
um this is a high-impact crime and as a result
<Sync time="136.450"/>
there is uh a lot of you know
<Sync time="138.795"/>
a lot of care that goes into constructing um
<Sync time="142.340"/>
a a criminal profile
<Sync time="143.865"/>
that is designed to evade um security .
<Sync time="147.225"/>
and as such you need proxies that are easier to identify , to figure out
<Sync time="151.665"/>
how you narrow your scope down to uh you know potential perpetrators
<Sync time="156.120"/>
and one way to do that that is um
<Sync time="158.800"/>
extremely accurate and correlating with the criminal profile
<Sync time="162.465"/>
is race .
<Sync time="163.770"/>
um
<Sync time="164.560"/>
and this brings me into my second point and really beating back i think what is going to be the main line out of opposition and that's
<Sync time="171.030"/>
specifically the rights violations .
<Sync time="173.680"/>
i don't think it's a reasonable to contest that there are inherently rights violations that are associated with racial profiling .
<Sync time="180.800"/>
the problem is that
<Sync time="182.460"/>
as is the case with any rights debate
<Sync time="184.620"/>
you have to weigh this against the high magnitude of the crimes that are going to be perpetrated ,
<Sync time="189.480"/>
something like an airplane bombing or a hijacking
<Sync time="192.385"/>
puts a lot of people's lives in danger .
<Sync time="196.430"/>
so i think it's important then to ensure
<Sync time="199.135"/>
that you're going to take really really clear steps to ensure that this
<Sync time="203.310"/>
does not happen no matter what the cost
<Sync time="206.230"/>
um you know stop and frisk is also something that has rights violations
<Sync time="210.365"/>
um this is yes it's obviously profiling it's obviously going to infringe on um you know
<Sync time="217.000"/>
concepts like innocent before proven guilty
<Sync time="219.440"/>
but if the tradeoff there is you know
<Sync time="221.930"/>
dozens if not hundreds of lives then i think that's a reasonable tradeoff that's the more significant goal that we need to work towards is ensuring that access to your right to life essentially .
<Sync time="233.010"/>
proud to propose .
<Sync time="234.594"/>
