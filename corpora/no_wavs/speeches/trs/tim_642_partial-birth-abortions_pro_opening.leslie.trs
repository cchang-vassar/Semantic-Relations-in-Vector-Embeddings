partial birth abortions .
<Sync time="2.300"/>
so before we start the debate , we also want to say that as part of banning this type
<Sync time="6.440"/>
of abortion , we want to say that
<Sync time="8.300"/>
if you were to do this , you would also allow
<Sync time="10.655"/>
uh more open access to abortion
<Sync time="13.095"/>
and the first trimester to ensure that
<Sync time="15.525"/>
women have the option
<Sync time="17.010"/>
of getting an abortion . we don't want to
<Sync time="19.065"/>
ban this type of abortion
<Sync time="20.830"/>
and additionally ban other types of abortion . we want to
<Sync time="23.330"/>
expand the access to others ,
<Sync time="24.720"/>
but we think that this type of abortion
<Sync time="26.430"/>
isn't justified , and we think it's actively harmful
<Sync time="28.845"/>
to women and women's rights .
<Sync time="30.700"/>
okay , so first we're going to talk about what justifies abortion and why this doesn't meet that justification ,
<Sync time="36.015"/>
and secondly we're gonna talk about the negative political will
<Sync time="38.970"/>
associated with partial-birth aber- abortion .
<Sync time="41.450"/>
so firstly , on justification .
<Sync time="43.720"/>
we think that there are
<Sync time="45.135"/>
a couple of main justifications
<Sync time="47.360"/>
for abortion
<Sync time="48.165"/>
in the status quo . we think the primary justification
<Sync time="51.030"/>
is that based on a balancing of rights ,
<Sync time="53.520"/>
abortion should be allowed ,
<Sync time="55.300"/>
that women's bodily autonomy
<Sync time="57.370"/>
outweighs the fetus's
<Sync time="59.240"/>
right to life , for the fact that
<Sync time="61.015"/>
at the time when a woman would have an abortion ,
<Sync time="63.400"/>
a fetus is not viable .
<Sync time="65.180"/>
it isn't capable of using its cognizance , it isn't able to make judgments ,
<Sync time="69.190"/>
it isn't able to live outside of the womb of the mother and therefore ,
<Sync time="72.510"/>
is entirely dependent
<Sync time="73.925"/>
on that mother .
<Sync time="75.060"/>
we think that this is an unfair
<Sync time="77.020"/>
uh expectation to place on a woman ,
<Sync time="78.935"/>
and we think that there are numerous reasons why a woman might want to have an abortion
<Sync time="82.420"/>
that are entirely justified
<Sync time="84.180"/>
and don't mean that she opted into having that child , for example , in cases of rape ,
<Sync time="88.370"/>
in cases where birth control
<Sync time="90.680"/>
proved ineffective but the woman took all proper steps to ensure that she wouldn't get pregnant .
<Sync time="95.510"/>
and we think that
<Sync time="96.465"/>
a woman's ability to use her bodily autonomy , to choose how her body
<Sync time="100.505"/>
is going to interact with the world around her
<Sync time="102.820"/>
and what is going to happen to her body ,
<Sync time="104.830"/>
especially with something as drastic
<Sync time="106.570"/>
as carrying a child to term and giving birth ,
<Sync time="109.440"/>
we think that this is something that a woman should have full autonomy
<Sync time="112.220"/>
in making the decision of ,
<Sync time="113.750"/>
especially given the case that early in the tri-
<Sync time="116.560"/>
early in the pregnancy ,
<Sync time="117.920"/>
a fetus is not capable , is not a viable living creature .
<Sync time="121.645"/>
and we think that arguments for potentiality open a paradox
<Sync time="124.820"/>
in which
<Sync time="125.605"/>
uh we give preference to potential creatures , to potential life
<Sync time="129.075"/>
in all instances , and we make things such as masturbation
<Sync time="132.305"/>
and
<Sync time="132.975"/>
uh things like that and having sex for
<Sync time="135.250"/>
reasons other than intercourse ,
<Sync time="137.210"/>
uh we think you would also have to ban those things under a potentiality argument , because all sperm could become
<Sync time="142.535"/>
a child , all egg could become a child .
<Sync time="145.090"/>
and we think that a potentiality argument
<Sync time="147.025"/>
just leads to a slippery slope . but we think in the case of a partial birth
<Sync time="150.605"/>
uh in the case of late
<Sync time="152.060"/>
uh late-term abortions , we don't think that these same arguments
<Sync time="154.900"/>
hold up . you're at a point in which the child , the fetus , has become viable
<Sync time="158.465"/>
and therefore the question is no longer one
<Sync time="160.585"/>
of potentiality ,
<Sync time="161.905"/>
but one of weighing the right to life that this living creature , this viable creature , has
<Sync time="166.860"/>
against the rights to bodily autonomy of the woman ,
<Sync time="169.280"/>
especially because if you increase access to abortion other times ,
<Sync time="172.920"/>
we think that the woman has had full capability of expressing her bodily autonomy , has had full
<Sync time="177.845"/>
uh has had the full range of time and opportunity to do so
<Sync time="181.820"/>
and in not choosing to do so earlier , we think
<Sync time="184.020"/>
the right of the fetus
<Sync time="185.450"/>
then outweighs the mother
<Sync time="186.890"/>
in the long run .
<Sync time="188.480"/>
okay ,
<Sync time="188.960"/>
secondly , on political will .
<Sync time="190.565"/>
we think that because partial-birth abortions are such a dramatic and
<Sync time="194.590"/>
kind of visceral thing that can be portrayed in the media by anti-abortion activists
<Sync time="199.045"/>
and other uh groups of the like ,
<Sync time="201.130"/>
we think that by banning partial-birth abortion ,
<Sync time="204.140"/>
you're more likely to get political will
<Sync time="206.065"/>
for other types of abortion . we think that when people can paint
<Sync time="209.280"/>
abortions , all abortions ,
<Sync time="211.030"/>
as this kind of viscerally negative thing ,
<Sync time="213.250"/>
it
<Sync time="213.595"/>
c- increases political will from those on the fence , from moderates ,
<Sync time="216.760"/>
against abortion
<Sync time="218.060"/>
for all . we think that by banning partial-birth abortion , you make it
<Sync time="221.265"/>
less likely that these types of visceral images are going to come out , less likely
<Sync time="225.285"/>
that anti-abortion activists are going to be able to paint this as all abortions ,
<Sync time="228.910"/>
and therefore more likely that in the long run ,
<Sync time="231.380"/>
more women are able to express their bodily autonomy
<Sync time="234.250"/>
than if you keep partial-birth ab-
<Sync time="235.970"/>
partial-birth abortions
<Sync time="237.470"/>
as an actual option .
<Sync time="238.950"/>
for these reasons , we should ban partial-birth abortions .
<Sync time="242.510"/>
