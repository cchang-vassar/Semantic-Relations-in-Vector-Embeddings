we should ban fraternities .
<Sync time="2.740"/>
by this we mean to say that
<Sync time="5.000"/>
american colleges and universities should ban
<Sync time="8.200"/>
fraternities and sororities .
<Sync time="10.620"/>
these are single-sex social clubs which usually
<Sync time="14.130"/>
own houses on a university campus , where their members live ,
<Sync time="18.570"/>
which host
<Sync time="19.390"/>
uh kind of raucous parties and other social events for their members and their friends ,
<Sync time="24.570"/>
and which generally serve as the main social focus on campus .
<Sync time="29.740"/>
we have a few reasons why we think these fraternities should be banned ,
<Sync time="33.510"/>
by which we mean they should be shut down by their universities and have their houses taken away .
<Sync time="37.885"/>

<Sync time="38.640"/>
first ,
<Sync time="39.240"/>
fraternities are by their very nature exclusive .
<Sync time="42.590"/>
they're almost all open to only people of one sex , and many of them exclude transgender people and intersex people .
<Sync time="49.490"/>

<Sync time="50.335"/>
defenders of fraternities will point out that some have recently become
<Sync time="54.365"/>
uh multigender or more accepting ,
<Sync time="56.710"/>
but this doesn't really change the problem .
<Sync time="58.980"/>
these fraternities have a limited number of spots and they recruit people based on how much they appeal socially to the existing members ,
<Sync time="66.690"/>
which means that because these fraternities were founded as drinking clubs for rich white boys ,
<Sync time="71.610"/>
they're going to remain
<Sync time="72.690"/>
drinking clubs for rich white boys .
<Sync time="75.000"/>
maybe now they let in one or two asians or jews but that doesn't really change their very nature .
<Sync time="80.205"/>
these go back to very exclusive ,
<Sync time="82.410"/>
racist clubs designed to perpetuate
<Sync time="84.775"/>
the old american elite in the early twentieth century .
<Sync time="88.490"/>
and even if not
<Sync time="89.580"/>
all fraternities act that way ,
<Sync time="91.680"/>
all fraternities are modeled on groups that exist to this end ,
<Sync time="95.205"/>
and we don't think that they should be allowed to continue to do so .
<Sync time="98.870"/>
in particular ,
<Sync time="99.820"/>
as we begin to encourage more inclusivity
<Sync time="102.340"/>
and less racism and less
<Sync time="104.230"/>
uh
<Sync time="104.815"/>
biased behavior , basically , on college campuses ,
<Sync time="108.580"/>
it's contradictory to let organizations that exist to promote bias
<Sync time="112.530"/>
remain , organizations that entrench bullying
<Sync time="115.425"/>
through hazing in their selection processes .
<Sync time="118.550"/>

<Sync time="119.505"/>
our second argument is that fraternities promote a bad culture on college campuses .
<Sync time="125.190"/>
i already mentioned hazing and bullying .
<Sync time="127.465"/>
the fraternity selection process , by its very nature ,
<Sync time="130.580"/>
strips people of many of their essential characteristics ,
<Sync time="133.755"/>
and then judges them based on how much they appeal to the
<Sync time="136.730"/>
people who are already members .
<Sync time="138.520"/>
essentially ,
<Sync time="139.280"/>
the popular kids choose who gets to be a member of their club .
<Sync time="143.090"/>
so bullying is baked into the system
<Sync time="145.890"/>
but what's more , because they choose who can and can't come to their parties ,
<Sync time="149.690"/>
they effectively control access to alcohol
<Sync time="152.450"/>
for underage drinkers on campus .
<Sync time="154.775"/>
fraternities use this control over alcohol to lure young women to their houses ,
<Sync time="159.470"/>
get them drunk , and then take advantage of them sexually .
<Sync time="163.050"/>
this is why there are so many rape and sexual assault charges
<Sync time="166.120"/>
associated with fraternities .
<Sync time="168.260"/>
some studies indicate that being a member of a fraternity indicates that someone
<Sync time="172.280"/>
is twice as likely to commit sexual assault
<Sync time="174.770"/>
as not being a member of a fraternity .
<Sync time="177.060"/>
so we think that it's clear that because
<Sync time="178.760"/>
they're encouraging bullying and much worse , because they're encouraging sexual assault , that they should be banned .
<Sync time="184.230"/>
the increased rates of rape and sexual assault that happen because of fraternities
<Sync time="188.490"/>
are enough reason
<Sync time="189.570"/>
in themselves to ban these organizations ,
<Sync time="191.955"/>
and nothing the other side says about how they create brotherhood or encourage volunteer work
<Sync time="197.165"/>
is going to outweigh this .
<Sync time="198.970"/>

<Sync time="199.560"/>
and our final point is that fraternities and sororities hinder learning on campus .
<Sync time="204.970"/>
universities exists to educate young citizens ,
<Sync time="207.795"/>
but because fraternities often encourage their members to drink all the time instead of do work ,
<Sync time="212.700"/>
because they help their members to cheat in order to get through school without actually learning ,
<Sync time="217.440"/>
we think that they actually undermine the educational goals of the university .
<Sync time="222.010"/>
many fraternities do things like save
<Sync time="224.205"/>
old versions of exams so that their members can study them
<Sync time="227.585"/>
or get ants- answers to questions from members who are older than them in the fraternity ,
<Sync time="232.520"/>
which lets people skirt around having to do actual work and actually learn ,
<Sync time="236.600"/>
so that they have more time to drink cheap beer
<Sync time="238.915"/>
and try to knock up
<Sync time="240.120"/>
freshman girls .
<Sync time="241.600"/>
so because they prevent learning , because of the extremely harmful culture that they create ,
<Sync time="246.760"/>
and because they're so exclusive ,
<Sync time="248.550"/>
we should ban fraternities .
<Sync time="250.290"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="251.359"/>
