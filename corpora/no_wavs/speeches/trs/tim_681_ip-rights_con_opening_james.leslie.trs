we should not abolish intellectual property rights .
<Sync time="4.150"/>
so in this debate we want to talk about two main arguments . the first is about fairness
<Sync time="8.225"/>
and the second is about
<Sync time="9.590"/>
innovation and social utility . so first ,
<Sync time="12.045"/>
on fairness .
<Sync time="13.260"/>
broadly , we would say that property rights are important
<Sync time="16.055"/>
and ought be protected .
<Sync time="17.710"/>
we would say that people exert effort , time
<Sync time="20.620"/>
and put their own labor into the products of their creation ,
<Sync time="23.995"/>
and because they are the sole creators or the primary creators
<Sync time="27.665"/>
of their products ,
<Sync time="29.010"/>
we think that
<Sync time="29.440"/>
they deserve to have
<Sync time="30.830"/>
control over that product , the control to have a pro- they deserve to have a property right
<Sync time="35.385"/>
over that product .
<Sync time="36.860"/>
if you buy that this is the case ,
<Sync time="38.715"/>
and
<Sync time="39.300"/>
for the vast majority of countries there's
<Sync time="41.480"/>
an obvious uh
<Sync time="42.705"/>
there are obvious laws protecting property rights ,
<Sync time="45.370"/>
we would say that
<Sync time="46.040"/>
intellectual property
<Sync time="47.290"/>
is no philosophically different
<Sync time="49.595"/>
from physical property that has been protected
<Sync time="52.465"/>
by modern states since their conception .
<Sync time="55.130"/>
we would say that
<Sync time="55.980"/>
intellectual property
<Sync time="57.290"/>
requires the exertion of
<Sync time="58.735"/>
immense amounts of mental effort ,
<Sync time="60.670"/>
immense amounts
<Sync time="61.625"/>
of innovation ,
<Sync time="62.795"/>
and immense amounts of investment from individuals . and we think that intellectual property
<Sync time="67.550"/>
clearly has in-
<Sync time="69.285"/>
uh in- in-
<Sync time="70.530"/>
intense market value . it clearly has
<Sync time="72.860"/>
this market value that is
<Sync time="74.655"/>
a part of its own creation . and because of this ,
<Sync time="77.400"/>
if you do not guarantee the protection
<Sync time="79.470"/>
of that pr-
<Sync time="80.270"/>
of that property right for the people that have created it ,
<Sync time="83.180"/>
people are still going to profit off of these intellectual property creations . peop- this isn't just going to
<Sync time="88.510"/>
sit in the ether and everyone is going to be able to freely use it .
<Sync time="91.695"/>
it just means that
<Sync time="92.925"/>
people that watch this intellectual property be created will be able to package it
<Sync time="97.460"/>
and that corporations will be able to sell it as their own
<Sync time="100.070"/>
without any sort of royalty going to the creator
<Sync time="102.685"/>
of this property .
<Sync time="103.700"/>
given that there is a profit that is going to be generated
<Sync time="106.740"/>
from valuable intellectual property ,
<Sync time="109.100"/>
we think that it is most fair that that profit
<Sync time="111.830"/>
is in the hands of those that created it , those that exerted the effort ,
<Sync time="116.140"/>
that
<Sync time="116.555"/>
created the knowledge that composes this intellectual property .
<Sync time="119.980"/>
they should be the ones that are able to control this .
<Sync time="122.550"/>
for example ,
<Sync time="123.465"/>
if you created a song , if you're a songwriter and you made the song ,
<Sync time="127.390"/>
we think that you should have the ability to determine where that song is played and who gets to use it .
<Sync time="132.260"/>
for example , many people don't allow politicians to use their music , because they are associated with that music in their brand associated with that music
<Sync time="139.795"/>
and they don't want it to be politicized ,
<Sync time="141.530"/>
or they disagree with the
<Sync time="142.330"/>
politician , and we think that that is
<Sync time="143.820"/>
entirely fair .
<Sync time="145.180"/>
and without intellectual property rights , instances like that
<Sync time="147.970"/>
would not allow the creator to be protected .
<Sync time="150.400"/>
the second thing we want to talk about though is innovation .
<Sync time="153.110"/>
we think that intellectual property rights
<Sync time="155.165"/>
ensure that creators
<Sync time="156.645"/>
get to profit off of their efforts , they get to
<Sync time="159.100"/>
profit off of their intellectual property .
<Sync time="161.300"/>
what this means is that
<Sync time="162.605"/>
there's a market incentive in the status quo
<Sync time="165.050"/>
to be innovative .
<Sync time="166.430"/>
but if you remove that
<Sync time="167.600"/>
profit incentive ,
<Sync time="168.775"/>
we think you get a free rider problem in which all people know that they can profit off of other individuals' creations
<Sync time="174.565"/>
and there's no incentive to invest the time and effort
<Sync time="177.585"/>
yourself in order to create valuable i_p ,
<Sync time="180.570"/>
because you can just take the i_p from others
<Sync time="182.800"/>
and repackage it and rebrand it . what this means
<Sync time="185.490"/>
en masse is that you're going to have less market innovation ,
<Sync time="188.810"/>
and this has real world implications . in the tech world , in the health industry ,
<Sync time="193.040"/>
intellectual property is incredibly important
<Sync time="195.780"/>
to these sectors ,
<Sync time="196.725"/>
and these are the sectors that are driving global growth
<Sync time="199.490"/>
and global innovation . these are the things that allow
<Sync time="202.035"/>
for longer life spans . these are the things that allow
<Sync time="204.675"/>
for more leisure l-
<Sync time="205.795"/>
leisure time in individual's lives
<Sync time="207.900"/>
and for a higher quality of life
<Sync time="210.370"/>
for the average person . we think that these sectors in particular
<Sync time="214.330"/>
are vulnerable
<Sync time="215.400"/>
if you remove intellectual property rights
<Sync time="217.995"/>
and that these sectors are driving global growth in the status quo .
<Sync time="221.600"/>
by removing intellectual property rights ,
<Sync time="223.730"/>
we think you remove
<Sync time="224.935"/>
an immense amount of the innovation that currently exists ,
<Sync time="227.640"/>
and you
<Sync time="228.040"/>
harm global growth as a result .
<Sync time="230.490"/>
for these reasons , we should not abolish intellectual property rights .
<Sync time="234.960"/>
