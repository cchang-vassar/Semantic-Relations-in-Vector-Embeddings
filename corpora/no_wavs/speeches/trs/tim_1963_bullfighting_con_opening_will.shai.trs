bullfighting should not be banned .
<Sync time="2.845"/>
in this round we're going to make to main
<Sync time="5.180"/>
arguments :
<Sync time="5.935"/>
the first is that we would say that animals
<Sync time="8.040"/>
do not have rights , and they certainly don't have rights to the extent
<Sync time="11.135"/>
that protects them from being killed ,
<Sync time="13.180"/>
and the second is that people should be allowed to take risks ,
<Sync time="16.180"/>
in that
<Sync time="17.010"/>
uh risk aversion and trying to maximize the length of one's life
<Sync time="20.820"/>
is not the only metric of a good life
<Sync time="23.220"/>
lived .
<Sync time="23.930"/>
okay so on animals and animal rights :
<Sync time="26.730"/>
we would say that rights
<Sync time="28.010"/>
rather than being some ethereal thing that is defined by the universe around us
<Sync time="32.020"/>
are rather just a social construct
<Sync time="34.290"/>
made by humanity .
<Sync time="35.670"/>
that when we came together in societies
<Sync time="37.660"/>
there were certain ideas and certain protections
<Sync time="40.515"/>
that people viewed as necessary
<Sync time="42.485"/>
in order for them to have
<Sync time="43.875"/>
a reasonably good livelihood .
<Sync time="45.865"/>
and those are what we choose to deem as rights .
<Sync time="49.160"/>
animals are simply not a part of this construct . they're not something
<Sync time="52.655"/>
that we take into account when we choose
<Sync time="54.620"/>
what are the preferences that people would hold . for example , we don't think of what the preferences of a pig are and try to give that pig
<Sync time="61.140"/>
a certain degree
<Sync time="62.415"/>
of control over how we form the system of rights . we form it with the idea
<Sync time="66.695"/>
of what humans need in mind ,
<Sync time="68.500"/>
and we also have certain tenants that make those rights capable of being upheld
<Sync time="72.265"/>
that animals cannot respect , and therefore extending rights to those animals
<Sync time="76.160"/>
doesn't make sense .
<Sync time="77.260"/>
the first is that animals cannot internalize the value of rights .
<Sync time="80.890"/>
part of rights being part of the value of rights themselves
<Sync time="84.665"/>
is not the idea that it allows you to have this protection , to have these freedoms ,
<Sync time="88.950"/>
but to know that you have those freedoms
<Sync time="90.830"/>
and to make choices for yourself and to make decisions for your life and your future
<Sync time="94.770"/>
with those protections in mind . for example
<Sync time="97.275"/>
i know that i have the right to uh
<Sync time="99.210"/>
reasonable trial or a trial by a jury of my peers
<Sync time="102.430"/>
and a right to be protected in court ,
<Sync time="104.820"/>
all these types of things .
<Sync time="106.170"/>
these rights allow me to make decisions
<Sync time="108.110"/>
with the idea that i won't be unjustly prosecuted
<Sync time="111.025"/>
for taking some sort of act that the government
<Sync time="113.210"/>
may not entirely approve of ,
<Sync time="115.210"/>
but something that isn't illegal . and this allows me to make choices in the future
<Sync time="118.900"/>
based on that understanding .
<Sync time="120.410"/>
animals don't have this ability and therefore 
<Sync time="122.305"/>
much of the value of rights go away .
<Sync time="124.370"/>
secondly and most importantly
<Sync time="125.780"/>
animals cannot reciprocate those rights .
<Sync time="127.900"/>
the only way that rights have power within a society
<Sync time="130.985"/>
is when all of us choose to reciprocate
<Sync time="133.550"/>
those obligations and those rights
<Sync time="135.500"/>
unto those around us .
<Sync time="137.100"/>
the reason that the right to life has become so valuable
<Sync time="139.870"/>
is because most of %hes
<Sync time="141.290"/>
the vast majority of people
<Sync time="143.365"/>
choose to acknowledge that that right is important
<Sync time="145.835"/>
and respect that claim to rights
<Sync time="147.950"/>
from other people .
<Sync time="149.020"/>
i choose not to kill others
<Sync time="150.730"/>
in part because i do not want to set up a norm system where people
<Sync time="154.445"/>
could kill me .
<Sync time="155.375"/>
look , at the end of the day
<Sync time="157.240"/>
bullfighting kills a bull
<Sync time="158.800"/>
in s- just a more entertaining way
<Sync time="161.140"/>
than the slaughter house , but it the end result is the exact same .
<Sync time="165.025"/>
and if you think that the slaughter house is okay , if you think that animals
<Sync time="168.885"/>
can be slaughtered to feed people ,
<Sync time="170.890"/>
and if you think that
<Sync time="172.145"/>
the system of rights that we have requires a reciprocation to be upheld ,
<Sync time="176.090"/>
clearly the extent of animal rights that
<Sync time="178.460"/>
banning bullfighting would require
<Sync time="180.660"/>
do not exist and should not exist .
<Sync time="183.050"/>
okay ,
<Sync time="183.600"/>
so now let's talk about the safety of people .
<Sync time="186.380"/>
firstly , it's simply not that dangerous to be a bull fighter . it's very rare for a bullfighter to die
<Sync time="191.925"/>
or be seriously injured
<Sync time="193.440"/>
while doing this task .
<Sync time="194.910"/>
and if they do harm themselves
<Sync time="196.720"/>
this is a risk they can take on without third party harms .
<Sync time="200.090"/>
so my choice to making risky decision on my behalf to be a bullfighter
<Sync time="204.230"/>
doesn't directly harm anyone else in my general vicinity . it's not setting up a risk
<Sync time="208.720"/>
onto other people that couldn't consent and that risk .
<Sync time="211.640"/>
given that , i am able to fully consent
<Sync time="214.260"/>
and fully , with
<Sync time="215.470"/>
knowledge that i could be harmed , choose to be a bull fighter .
<Sync time="218.620"/>
we think that it is fair
<Sync time="220.225"/>
to seek out thrill , to seek out excitement ,
<Sync time="222.625"/>
to seek out a cultural practice
<Sync time="225.070"/>
rather than simpl- to be simply choosing to be
<Sync time="227.650"/>
maximally risk averse ,
<Sync time="229.380"/>
which is what
<Sync time="230.195"/>
the protectionism of this idea , the protectionism of this ban would demand .
<Sync time="235.195"/>
it is not the case that animals
<Sync time="236.810"/>
hold the rights that require this to be banned ,
<Sync time="239.340"/>
is not the case that humans need to have this decision made for them
<Sync time="242.850"/>
and that life must be maximized in all terms .
<Sync time="245.540"/>
for these reasons ,
<Sync time="246.750"/>
bullfighting
<Sync time="247.580"/>
should not be banned .
<Sync time="250.529"/>
