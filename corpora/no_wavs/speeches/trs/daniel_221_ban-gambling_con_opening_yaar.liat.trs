we absolutely should not ban gambling because
<Sync time="4.275"/>
it won't work first of all ,
<Sync time="5.950"/>
and secondarily ,
<Sync time="7.490"/>
%hes there's nothing really wrong with gambling .
<Sync time="9.350"/>
it should be fine , it should be legal
<Sync time="11.270"/>
um if people want to do it .
<Sync time="13.010"/>
so ,
<Sync time="13.615"/>
let's start by talking about why banning gambling
<Sync time="16.320"/>
will not work at all .
<Sync time="18.090"/>
so ,
<Sync time="18.740"/>
the point of banning something , presumably , is you want to deter people from doing it because you think it has some kind of harm or
<Sync time="26.150"/>
problem .
<Sync time="27.340"/>
um so ,
<Sync time="28.660"/>
this
<Sync time="29.370"/>
has an assumption and the assumption is that the ban itself is actually going to deter people from the activity in the first place ,
<Sync time="36.090"/>
that is gambling .
<Sync time="37.270"/>
so ,
<Sync time="37.850"/>
that's not going to happen , and it's not going to happen because people have been gambling for thousands of years ,
<Sync time="42.980"/>
people
<Sync time="43.570"/>
rather enjoy gambling , um
<Sync time="45.620"/>
it's a pretty ingrained part of our culture , we have entire cities dedicated to it ,
<Sync time="50.050"/>
um
<Sync time="50.580"/>
you know , like there's gambling in las vegas obviously , i'm pretty sure there's a lot of gambling in places like eilat in
<Sync time="56.450"/>
israel as well ,
<Sync time="57.680"/>
there's all kinds of um like
<Sync time="59.715"/>
a lot of cities have these as their industries and things like that .
<Sync time="62.940"/>
so there's problems with this . so ,
<Sync time="64.080"/>
first and foremost a problem is that
<Sync time="65.935"/>
you're going to see a whole whole lot of resistance from the people who are involved in the gambling industry ,
<Sync time="71.600"/>
a whole lot of resistance about the cities and livelihoods that are being destroyed ,
<Sync time="75.400"/>
and a whole lot of resistance to all of these kinds of policies and bans in the first place .
<Sync time="79.470"/>
but second and more importantly ,
<Sync time="81.090"/>
it's completely unenforceable because you can just gamble on the internet ,
<Sync time="85.050"/>
um in
<Sync time="86.560"/>
there's nothing really the government can do to regulate it ,
<Sync time="88.910"/>
because oftentimes the websites can be set up in like different countries or
<Sync time="93.140"/>
you can
<Sync time="93.830"/>
even if like the websites are under like any kind of certain set of laws ,
<Sync time="98.110"/>
you're there's always ways that you can use the internet to avoid government detection ,
<Sync time="101.860"/>

<Sync time="102.535"/>
and i highly doubt that the government is going to dedicate
<Sync time="106.050"/>
like
<Sync time="106.675"/>
legit military and hacking and all kinds of technical and physical and monetary resources
<Sync time="112.505"/>
to really cracking down gambling ,
<Sync time="114.570"/>
and if it wanted to do that , it would cost like billions if not
<Sync time="118.230"/>
probably like like
<Sync time="119.330"/>
so much so many billions of dollars , that it would be a complete waste of time since people are largely going to do it on the internet anyway .
<Sync time="125.935"/>
and that's obviously a problem because
<Sync time="128.740"/>
first and foremost ,
<Sync time="130.020"/>
you're not making the money off of gambling anymore , you can't tax
<Sync time="133.410"/>
gambling , you can't um
<Sync time="134.925"/>
profit off of it ,
<Sync time="136.790"/>
so a lot of money in revenue is going away .
<Sync time="139.550"/>
uh additionally when you ban something then it becomes a part of a black market ,
<Sync time="143.710"/>
it's more likely to be unsafe ,
<Sync time="145.640"/>
you're more likely going to have like crime lords and people like that
<Sync time="149.110"/>
presiding over the factors .
<Sync time="150.750"/>
uh and additionally you also can't have things like consumer
<Sync time="154.295"/>
uh protection laws in place ,
<Sync time="156.200"/>
uh so you can't really enforce things to make sure that like y- , obviously gambling is random and to a large extent and
<Sync time="161.820"/>
things like that ,
<Sync time="162.860"/>
but enforcement to make sure that like you aren't being as a gambler
<Sync time="166.740"/>
like completely screwed over
<Sync time="168.425"/>
by the people like the house
<Sync time="170.370"/>
per se ,
<Sync time="171.380"/>
so that's important as well .
<Sync time="173.440"/>
um so gambling is probably going to happen anyway , might as well happen
<Sync time="176.750"/>
safer , more profitably , and more effectively if you just regulate it 
<Sync time="180.265"/>
rather than ban it .
<Sync time="181.400"/>
but i also think that there's nothing wrong with th-
<Sync time="183.890"/>
gambling and it's rather immoral to ban it in the first place ,
<Sync time="187.910"/>
because keep in mind that when people are gambling
<Sync time="190.210"/>
they're usually gambling with their own money , if they're gambling with someone else's money we call them wall street bankers ,
<Sync time="196.000"/>
so they're usually gambling with their own money
<Sync time="198.250"/>
not other people's ,
<Sync time="199.325"/>
so that's money that you've earned , that's money that
<Sync time="202.150"/>
you can uh
<Sync time="203.040"/>
do what you want with ,
<Sync time="204.845"/>
you should have the right to spend your money in the way you want , because you work for it .
<Sync time="208.980"/>
but additionally , gambling doesn't harm anyone , it's not like
<Sync time="212.510"/>
i-
<Sync time="213.130"/>
gambling doesn't really harm people , like any kind of vague things like crime or whatever th- l-
<Sync time="217.250"/>
like maybe vaguely associated with gambling is problematic ,
<Sync time="220.730"/>
that's usually only because the other things like drugs or prostitution or whatever are illegal in the first place , maybe that should be illegal too ,
<Sync time="227.800"/>
but also ,
<Sync time="229.330"/>
keep in mind that like the black market argument that i made about how that's not going to be solved anyway , so
<Sync time="234.480"/>
other than maybe like
<Sync time="235.870"/>
the vague facilitation of crime , there's no real reason why gambling itself is all that bad ,
<Sync time="240.585"/>
why you shouldn't be able to spend your money
<Sync time="242.840"/>
um that you earned that way if you want .
<Sync time="245.160"/>
so for those reasons , we should not ban gambling .
<Sync time="249.159"/>
