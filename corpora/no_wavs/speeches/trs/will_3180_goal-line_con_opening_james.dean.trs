i am proud to stand in opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.665"/>
that we should introduce goal line technology in football games .
<Sync time="8.490"/>
two independent points .
<Sync time="10.610"/>
first is the human element that is associated with the status quo .
<Sync time="16.410"/>
we think that sports in general have a disturbing trend that they're moving towards
<Sync time="22.160"/>
in adopting technology to replace the rules of humans .
<Sync time="26.510"/>
this is problematic
<Sync time="28.160"/>
a ,
<Sync time="28.785"/>
because we think that a significant portion of why we enjoy sports in general
<Sync time="33.290"/>
has to do with that human element of it
<Sync time="35.620"/>
that is the uh
<Sync time="36.850"/>
impressiveness of seeing human beings
<Sync time="39.320"/>
achieve individual feats
<Sync time="41.230"/>
and we think that %hes
<Sync time="42.175"/>
extends as well to the refereeing that
<Sync time="44.750"/>
this is something that we care about having that human connection with
<Sync time="48.210"/>
but b , because we think that
<Sync time="50.400"/>
a lot of decisions that are made in football and other sports
<Sync time="54.205"/>
have assess
<Sync time="55.575"/>
a certain context associated with
<Sync time="58.150"/>
that is that
<Sync time="59.235"/>
there is a need to make subjective decisions on individual things
<Sync time="63.390"/>
and that when you introduce machines
<Sync time="65.760"/>
into these sports ,
<Sync time="67.180"/>
um you lose that capacity to make contextual decisions from the human perspective .
<Sync time="73.000"/>
um with specific regard to goals in football ,
<Sync time="76.750"/>
um you know we think that there are
<Sync time="78.345"/>
different situations in which um
<Sync time="81.075"/>
you know the computer technology can fail to
<Sync time="84.130"/>
um
<Sync time="84.750"/>
appropriately record whether or not a goal is made
<Sync time="87.565"/>
based on essentially the parameters that are initially fed to the machine .
<Sync time="91.985"/>
this is a problem
<Sync time="93.360"/>
then
<Sync time="93.845"/>
for two reasons .
<Sync time="95.210"/>
one , we think that it sets a trend
<Sync time="97.965"/>
in football
<Sync time="99.060"/>
towards uh machine recording in general .
<Sync time="101.705"/>
so i think even if you don't believe that
<Sync time="104.050"/>
goal line technology is specifically abu-
<Sync time="106.450"/>
an abuse
<Sync time="107.300"/>
we think that this sets in motion a slippery slope
<Sync time="109.980"/>
of moving towards more machine based recording and decision making
<Sync time="114.700"/>
in sports
<Sync time="115.595"/>
that is less capable of um
<Sync time="118.235"/>

<Sync time="118.800"/>
accounting for the context of a specific action .
<Sync time="122.570"/>
but secondly ,
<Sync time="123.920"/>
we think that it's a problem
<Sync time="125.675"/>
because um
<Sync time="127.190"/>
because there is %hes
<Sync time="128.660"/>
abuses that are going to happen in real time essentially that
<Sync time="132.175"/>
you won't know the machine has an intrinsic issue with it
<Sync time="135.730"/>
until that issue arises and makes that mistake
<Sync time="139.020"/>
and because of the nature of the way that football works ,
<Sync time="141.900"/>
you can't go back on that decision after it's been made if the call's been
<Sync time="146.64"/>
made then the call was made
<Sync time="148.060"/>
and you've made that decision for goal line technology to supplant the role of the referee in that scenario
<Sync time="153.755"/>
given that we think that it least at the
<Sync time="156.515"/>
beginning there arw
<Sync time="157.750"/>
inevitably going to be faulty calls because
<Sync time="160.785"/>
the machine will essentially be tested out in real time in actual games where those faulty decisions will essentially become law .
<Sync time="168.700"/>
our second independent point is hacking .
<Sync time="171.845"/>
so
<Sync time="173.065"/>
we think that uh
<Sync time="175.490"/>
obviously there are some arguments that gov brings forward about
<Sync time="178.730"/>
um subjectiveness and potentially even corruption amongst referees .
<Sync time="183.140"/>
largely um we think that this is a
<Sync time="185.880"/>
fairly silly .
<Sync time="186.920"/>
referees are generally hired by the league and are fairly objective .
<Sync time="190.260"/>
um the problem with goal line technology then is two fold .
<Sync time="194.100"/>
the first is that it is a
<Sync time="195.580"/>
computer run and as such it is subject to hacking
<Sync time="198.510"/>
um
<Sync time="199.100"/>
sports fans care very deeply
<Sync time="201.185"/>
about the outcome of games
<Sync time="202.830"/>
and we don't think it's
<Sync time="203.905"/>
um
<Sync time="204.475"/>
you know hard to imagine somebody you know making that decision to
<Sync time="208.280"/>
actively tamper with this technology in an effort to
<Sync time="211.850"/>
benefit their own team
<Sync time="213.695"/>

<Sync time="214.430"/>
um but beyond this we think that actually the goal line technology is often managed in house through technology housed in
<Sync time="221.140"/>
individual stadiums
<Sync time="222.750"/>
and as such
<Sync time="223.980"/>
um teams themselves can actually manipulate this technology with relative ease
<Sync time="228.730"/>
that then opens um
<Sync time="230.230"/>
a significantly easier door for corruption
<Sync time="232.980"/>
and uh problems within this technology
<Sync time="236.065"/>
that we think mitigates the uh usefulness of this
<Sync time="239.240"/>
certainly indeff- uh
<Sync time="241.070"/>
defining accuracy
<Sync time="242.615"/>
but also in terms of the fairness that gov touts .
<Sync time="245.390"/>
proud to oppose .
<Sync time="247.247"/>
