we should not abolish three-strikes laws .
<Sync time="3.350"/>
so we're going to say that in places like california that currently use three strikes laws ,
<Sync time="8.730"/>
this policy should continue to be implemented
<Sync time="11.465"/>
in the future .
<Sync time="12.920"/>
our first point ,
<Sync time="14.480"/>
no surprises here , is about deterrence .
<Sync time="17.700"/>
so , we would tell you
<Sync time="18.890"/>
that when people choose to commit a crime ,
<Sync time="21.090"/>
maybe they're not acting perfectly rationally ,
<Sync time="23.595"/>
but they still have
<Sync time="24.740"/>
some decision-making process about whether or not
<Sync time="27.525"/>
it seems like a good idea to go out and commit this crime .
<Sync time="31.280"/>
presumably , if every crime
<Sync time="33.270"/>
carried no penalty other than a five hundred dollar fine and a little bit of community service ,
<Sync time="38.600"/>
people would be much more likely to commit crimes .
<Sync time="41.310"/>
on the other hand , if every crime had the death penalty , i imagine many fewer people will be willing to
<Sync time="45.540"/>
commit a crime .
<Sync time="46.365"/>
we have to find a balancing act , though , between a cruel and unusual punishment
<Sync time="50.920"/>
and one that deters people from committing crimes .
<Sync time="54.060"/>
the reason why i think that three-strikes policies are a happy middle ground
<Sync time="57.880"/>
is that people really know what they're getting into .
<Sync time="60.510"/>
people can understand that
<Sync time="62.030"/>
if you commit two crimes ,
<Sync time="63.910"/>
then those are your first two strikes ,
<Sync time="66.155"/>
and you're being punished according to the crime you committed .
<Sync time="68.870"/>
and if you commit a third crime , then you're being punished for having become
<Sync time="72.170"/>
a sort of career criminal and a perpetual menace to your community .
<Sync time="76.200"/>
more on that in just a moment .
<Sync time="77.830"/>
but i think it's clear that people can think about this and internalize that risk of relying on crime as a way of life
<Sync time="83.820"/>
and that this discourages them from relying on crime in the long term
<Sync time="87.320"/>
as a way to support themselves .
<Sync time="89.940"/>
therefore , because it likely does deter people ,
<Sync time="92.625"/>
we think that the policy should continue .
<Sync time="94.855"/>
and will tells you about some study at one of the u_cs that claims that actually decreased alcohol consumption
<Sync time="101.400"/>
may have played a larger role in declining crime rates .
<Sync time="104.410"/>
crime rates are down all across the united states
<Sync time="107.110"/>
in almost every appreciable way and there are many reasons for that ,
<Sync time="110.475"/>
but it seems like you wouldn't be able to see the crimes that aren't being committed
<Sync time="114.640"/>
because people don't want to go to jail because of the three-strikes laws .
<Sync time="118.520"/>
so it seems difficult to %hes say that this hasn't had any effect when , in fact , crime has gone down
<Sync time="123.190"/>
since it was introduced .
<Sync time="124.935"/>

<Sync time="125.960"/>
our second argument is about the good of the community .
<Sync time="129.060"/>
the criminal justice system
<Sync time="130.740"/>
isn't really about
<Sync time="132.020"/>
individuals , at least in the united states .
<Sync time="134.400"/>
maybe it is more so in other countries .
<Sync time="136.540"/>
but here if you commit a crime ,
<Sync time="138.440"/>
then the state is the one who prosecutes you .
<Sync time="141.230"/>
so it's the people versus
<Sync time="143.800"/>
uh will smith or whoever you want to pick ,
<Sync time="146.450"/>
not the
<Sync time="148.135"/>
uh person who was harmed , drew latimer versus will smith .
<Sync time="151.840"/>
so , at that point , we tell you that we see that the state should be concerned about what's good for everyone ,
<Sync time="156.620"/>
not what's concerned
<Sync time="157.685"/>
for one particular victim or one particular person .
<Sync time="161.660"/>
communities are deeply harmed by having a strong
<Sync time="164.385"/>
criminal element .
<Sync time="165.740"/>
if young men , in particular , in your community think that they can do better for themselves
<Sync time="170.120"/>
by turning to crime than by participating in society
<Sync time="173.295"/>
in a more social way ,
<Sync time="175.240"/>
then ultimately that's going to harm the ability of people in your community to live normal , happy lives .
<Sync time="180.270"/>
so we think this is a huge harm and that the three-strikes law
<Sync time="183.010"/>
goes a long way to helping these communities
<Sync time="185.600"/>
by ensuring that people don't turn to a life of crime .
<Sync time="188.935"/>

<Sync time="189.940"/>
and my last argument is about organized crime and why we think this is especially effective
<Sync time="194.720"/>
in that case .
<Sync time="196.195"/>
a lot of organized crime relies on the idea that you have a group of people who will commit crimes for your organization ,
<Sync time="202.625"/>
and then they go to jail , and then they get back out and go right back to working for you .
<Sync time="206.375"/>
it's a lot harder to run a business like that
<Sync time="209.980"/>
if your people are going away for twenty-five years .
<Sync time="212.820"/>
basically , you would have to invest capital into training lots of new little criminals every year ,
<Sync time="217.760"/>
because your more experienced people getting locked up for twenty-five years .
<Sync time="221.700"/>
we don't think it would be sustainable to run a major crime ring
<Sync time="225.250"/>
by doing this .
<Sync time="226.280"/>
and the other side might say , " oh , well there's still organized crime in california . "
<Sync time="230.350"/>
but we've seen that the
<Sync time="231.310"/>
era of the crips and the bloods destroying los angeles is more or less over
<Sync time="235.685"/>
and that organized crime is on the decline ,
<Sync time="237.920"/>
except for international organized crime , which is another issue .
<Sync time="241.180"/>
so we think that actually this policy ,
<Sync time="242.970"/>
at the very least , has coincided with a decline in street gangs
<Sync time="246.410"/>
and that this may be a major factor therein .
<Sync time="248.735"/>
for all these reasons , we should not abolish three-strikes laws .
<Sync time="252.400"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="253.199"/>
