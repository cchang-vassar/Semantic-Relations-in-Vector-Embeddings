we should not legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="3.610"/>
so , we want to be very clear in this debate ,
<Sync time="6.480"/>
we're fine with allowing for civil partnerships between
<Sync time="9.570"/>
a same sex
<Sync time="10.725"/>
couple . 
<Sync time="11.67"/>
we're fine with giving same sex couples
<Sync time="13.740"/>
equal rights
<Sync time="14.685"/>
in legal- in the legal realm ,
<Sync time="17.080"/>
equal protections ,
<Sync time="18.110"/>
equal visitation rights , the ability to raise children together ,
<Sync time="20.700"/>
we don't think that same sex couples
<Sync time="22.460"/>
should be barred from starting a family together , and giving
<Sync time="25.200"/>
the legal recognition ,
<Sync time="26.495"/>
that such a family in such a structure
<Sync time="28.710"/>
deserves to be granted with . what we would say
<Sync time="31.420"/>
principally ,
<Sync time="32.150"/>
is that the state itself should not be involved in marriage
<Sync time="36.390"/>
at any level .
<Sync time="37.820"/>
we would say that marriage is , historically ,
<Sync time="40.305"/>
a patriarchal and religious tradition , that is
<Sync time="43.230"/>
firstly , an outdated means
<Sync time="44.975"/>
of giving away a woman to a man in- for for a property exchange ,
<Sync time="48.655"/>
but more importantly ,
<Sync time="49.685"/>
it's
<Sync time="50.105"/>
an inherently religious service . recognize , that for the vast majority of history ,
<Sync time="53.820"/>
the state didn't come together to wed two groups of people ,
<Sync time="56.770"/>
it was churches , it was religious institutions , that would do these things ,
<Sync time="59.925"/>
and we think
<Sync time="60.655"/>
that that is where marriage should be . we think it's fine to have civil partnerships
<Sync time="64.770"/>
in uh
<Sync time="65.385"/>
at the state level , we think it's fine for individuals
<Sync time="67.940"/>
to conjoin their assets
<Sync time="69.505"/>
in the way that marriage allows them to do ,
<Sync time="71.100"/>
all those legal aspects of marriage can be done without giving it the label of marriage , without
<Sync time="75.630"/>
giving it that religious connotation , that we think
<Sync time="78.025"/>
is so problematic in the status quo ,
<Sync time="80.165"/>
and is the real reason that people are denied-
<Sync time="82.610"/>
same sex couples are denied access to this thing in the status quo .
<Sync time="85.840"/>
but ,
<Sync time="86.415"/>
even if it seems hateful , we think that religions
<Sync time="89.170"/>
should have the freedom
<Sync time="90.380"/>
to do what they see as necessary , to follow their faith ,
<Sync time="93.780"/>
as long as it doesn't
<Sync time="95.065"/>
allow for people to
<Sync time="96.625"/>
have a lower level , or a lower quality of life , and we think that
<Sync time="100.010"/>
if you allow same sex couples to access the same legal protections ,
<Sync time="103.625"/>
that a married couple otherwise would ,
<Sync time="105.370"/>
we don't think that there's a major detraction
<Sync time="107.590"/>
to uh
<Sync time="108.510"/>
same sex couples ,
<Sync time="109.930"/>
as far as their quality of life
<Sync time="111.785"/>
is concerned .
<Sync time="112.990"/>
so , we think religious freedom is crucial .
<Sync time="115.270"/>
religion allows uh
<Sync time="116.460"/>
if you allow for religious interference in this instance , in this- in this occasion ,
<Sync time="120.670"/>
we think it will inevitably lead
<Sync time="122.615"/>
to future marginalization
<Sync time="124.350"/>
of religious communities . we think
<Sync time="126.355"/>
that you- what you're ultimately going to get
<Sync time="128.465"/>
is that you have a state that is willing to back
<Sync time="130.650"/>
religions that back the vast majority of individuals , and that marginal religion , and marginal communities ,
<Sync time="135.575"/>
are likely to be stamped out . we think that that's problematic , because we think that faith and religion
<Sync time="139.785"/>
are crucial to
<Sync time="140.540"/>
one's identity .
<Sync time="141.600"/>
they not only give you an understanding of your place in the world , and
<Sync time="145.090"/>
the after life , and all these things , but they also give you
<Sync time="147.740"/>
moral power , they give you the moral- uh
<Sync time="149.845"/>
the moral ideas that you hold with you
<Sync time="152.090"/>
in your life , and they allow you to make decisions in difficult situations .
<Sync time="155.460"/>
all of these things are crucial ,
<Sync time="156.910"/>
and yes , while some of these things may be based on outdated notions , that liberals don't agree with ,
<Sync time="161.760"/>
we don't think that it means
<Sync time="163.060"/>
that people don't receive value from these things , and that they're inherently problematic .
<Sync time="167.270"/>
we think
<Sync time="167.860"/>
faith- uh we think
<Sync time="168.920"/>
that uh if a faith doesn't allow this type thing ,
<Sync time="171.810"/>
you shouldn't force them to do these things . we think that the only legitimacy
<Sync time="175.700"/>
that the government has , as far as dictating religions ,
<Sync time="178.455"/>
is that it forces religious indivi-
<Sync time="180.235"/>
individuals in the public sphere
<Sync time="182.200"/>
to treat
<Sync time="182.965"/>
other individuals with
<Sync time="184.520"/>
an equal amount of respect , as they would to an- another religious individual .
<Sync time="188.630"/>
we don't think that that amount of respect
<Sync time="190.600"/>
uh in that- in order to achieve that amount of respect ,
<Sync time="193.350"/>
you necessarily
<Sync time="194.305"/>
need to ensure that people are able to have the
<Sync time="197.430"/>
same sex marriage . we think that giving them
<Sync time="199.650"/>
equal legal and political accountability ,
<Sync time="202.520"/>
equal political rights , and equal recognition ,
<Sync time="205.460"/>
even if you don't put the name of marriage onto it ,
<Sync time="207.645"/>
creates a balance between the religious freedom , that these institutions
<Sync time="211.220"/>
deserve to have
<Sync time="212.230"/>
and the protections that same sex couples
<Sync time="214.380"/>
also need to have .
<Sync time="215.590"/>
and for these reasons , we should not legalize same sex marriage .
<Sync time="219.170"/>
