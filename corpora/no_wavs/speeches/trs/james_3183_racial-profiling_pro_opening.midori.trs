we should increase racial profiling
<Sync time="3.255"/>
in the united states
<Sync time="4.520"/>
at airports .
<Sync time="5.970"/>
so in this debate what we're arguing is that whereas right now
<Sync time="10.090"/>
the t_s_a ,
<Sync time="11.120"/>
the security group at airports ,
<Sync time="13.230"/>
often denies that they use racial profiling , or is forced to search people they don't want to search
<Sync time="18.470"/>
to avoid the appearance of racial profiling .
<Sync time="20.850"/>
we should allow them instead to just openly racially profile people .
<Sync time="25.290"/>
a few reasons why we think this is the case .
<Sync time="28.320"/>
first of all safety .
<Sync time="29.640"/>
recognize that the reason why we have groups like the t_s_a
<Sync time="32.650"/>
in the first place is to promote
<Sync time="34.505"/>
airport security 
<Sync time="35.770"/>
and to prevent another nine eleven attack from happening .
<Sync time="38.630"/>
at the point where we know that the people most likely to carry out massive terrorist attacks
<Sync time="43.555"/>
are people from groups like al-qaeda , and at the point where those groups rep-
<Sync time="47.510"/>
recruit
<Sync time="48.205"/>
primarily among certain populations of a given race ,
<Sync time="51.310"/>
we think that since we're going after al-qaeda
<Sync time="53.700"/>
we should target the people most likely to be
<Sync time="55.725"/>
al-qaeda members .
<Sync time="57.410"/>

<Sync time="57.970"/>
now some people might say that this is contrary to the principle that you can't discriminate against people based on their race ,
<Sync time="64.070"/>
but we think that ultimately the trade off in terms of safety
<Sync time="67.350"/>
outweighs the harms to some people's individual freedom
<Sync time="70.330"/>
which is relatively modest .
<Sync time="71.970"/>
we're not talking about like strip searching people and having cavity searches and things like that .
<Sync time="76.440"/>
we're just talking about enhanced security
<Sync time="78.485"/>
for some individuals .
<Sync time="80.560"/>
our second argument is about fairness .
<Sync time="83.440"/>
now
<Sync time="83.880"/>
some people might say that it's unfair to profile
<Sync time="86.530"/>
one particular group .
<Sync time="87.965"/>
but we think that what is being done right now is actually worse .
<Sync time="91.625"/>
because recognize that this profiling still goes on in the status quo to a great extent .
<Sync time="96.615"/>
what happens in order to disguise it is that
<Sync time="99.565"/>
the t_s_a will stop
<Sync time="101.760"/>
one young 
<Sync time="102.890"/>
apparently arab man
<Sync time="104.515"/>
at the airport and that in order to avoid charges of discrimination
<Sync time="107.910"/>
stop
<Sync time="108.500"/>
three old white women at the same airport .
<Sync time="112.140"/>
we think that it's unfair to externalize these costs
<Sync time="115.360"/>
on to people who are very unlikely to be members of these terrorist groups and who have done nothing wrong
<Sync time="120.410"/>
in order to cover up this practice .
<Sync time="122.580"/>
in either world racial profiling is going on .
<Sync time="125.620"/>
the only question is : is it fair to punish other people
<Sync time="129.325"/>
in order to disguise this racial profiling ?
<Sync time="132.470"/>
we think that it would obviously be more fair to discriminate against fewer people , to make fewer people go through these procedures ,
<Sync time="139.010"/>
and that therefore we should just allow explicit racial profiling
<Sync time="142.470"/>
at american airports .
<Sync time="145.290"/>
our third and final argument is that public will is in support of racial profiling .
<Sync time="150.530"/>
why is this important ?
<Sync time="151.960"/>
the united states derives its legitimacy is a government because it rests on the will of the people .
<Sync time="157.465"/>
the american government is not a group of technocrats who decide what is best for the country ,
<Sync time="161.945"/>
it is a group of representatives who are supposed to represent the interests of their constituents .
<Sync time="167.130"/>
at the point where the united states is something like sixty five percent caucasian
<Sync time="171.265"/>
and
<Sync time="171.985"/>
overwhelmingly christian , probably over eighty percent , we think it's almost certain
<Sync time="176.795"/>
that a large majority of the country supports racial profiling
<Sync time="180.460"/>
against people of middle eastern background .
<Sync time="183.370"/>
we think that at that point the united states must follow the will of the people , even if it has ends that are morally
<Sync time="188.835"/>
intolerable to some individuals .
<Sync time="191.870"/>
recognize that in the past the u_s has carried out lots of unpopular policies that were technically legal because of public support .
<Sync time="198.700"/>
we think that we need to continue to do so
<Sync time="200.450"/>
now . and if these policies are actually country to the constitution ,
<Sync time="204.010"/>
then we should have supreme court rulings in place that prevent it from happening again .
<Sync time="208.200"/>
in the meantime though , it's not up to the executive branch or individual legislators to decide
<Sync time="213.190"/>
what is in the best interest of the american people when they've made their own wishes
<Sync time="217.170"/>
fairly clear .
<Sync time="218.690"/>
we think that in order for the american government to maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens
<Sync time="223.570"/>
it needs to implement
<Sync time="224.680"/>
popular ,
<Sync time="225.420"/>
well-liked policies such as racial profiling at airports .
<Sync time="229.215"/>
so ultimately , because racial profiling is going to go on either way , we think that it would be
<Sync time="234.470"/>
more fair
<Sync time="235.495"/>
to use it explicitly , and we think that the american government's legitimacy
<Sync time="239.780"/>
relies on public support and so therefore the policy should be implemented .
<Sync time="243.910"/>
thank you .
