we should not ban boxing .
<Sync time="3.515"/>
we're going to provide you with three arguments for why we don't think boxing should be banned .
<Sync time="8.480"/>
we think that boxing should continue to be allowed and encouraged in countries like the u_s ,
<Sync time="13.065"/>
britain , and other highly developed
<Sync time="15.030"/>
liberal democratic countries ,
<Sync time="16.735"/>
and also that boxing should remain an olympic sport
<Sync time="19.830"/>
and otherwise participated in
<Sync time="21.685"/>
internationally .
<Sync time="23.170"/>
we're okay with regulating boxing , such as preventing
<Sync time="26.400"/>
young men from participating before a certain age or requiring certain safety regulations ,
<Sync time="31.700"/>
but we think it would be a mistake to ban the sport
<Sync time="34.510"/>
in its entirety ,
<Sync time="35.710"/>
which is what the other side needs to prove to you
<Sync time="37.895"/>
in this debate :
<Sync time="38.720"/>
that it should be banned
<Sync time="39.780"/>
categorically , not merely regulated to be safer .
<Sync time="43.660"/>
our first argument
<Sync time="45.410"/>
is that we should respect the choices that athletes make .
<Sync time="48.550"/>
the other side tries to tell you that people can't
<Sync time="51.380"/>
internalize the risk of boxing ,
<Sync time="53.670"/>
but i don't think that you have to be
<Sync time="55.540"/>
a great scholar to understand that a sport where you try to achieve knockouts is potentially dangerous .
<Sync time="61.620"/>
if anything , i would say that boxers are probably much more pragmatic than athletes from other sports
<Sync time="66.800"/>
about
<Sync time="67.410"/>
how they can be safe with things like concussions and how they can take care of themselves .
<Sync time="72.020"/>
we see that , for instance , in kickboxing , which may be a different sport depending on your interpretation
<Sync time="77.330"/>
or may be interpreted
<Sync time="78.500"/>
or included in this motion but either way ,
<Sync time="81.240"/>
that they wear
<Sync time="81.975"/>
headgear . we see that boxers don't box bare knuckles in the olympics .
<Sync time="86.320"/>
ultimately , there are steps being taken to ensure safety .
<Sync time="89.555"/>
and what's more , we tell you that athletes have coaches .
<Sync time="92.550"/>
if you think about the relationship between boxers and their coaches ,
<Sync time="95.700"/>
you have an older person mentoring a younger person ,
<Sync time="98.625"/>
who is well aware of the risk that's being posed
<Sync time="100.885"/>
and can explain it and interpret it for them .
<Sync time="103.440"/>
so we think that people can make this decision for themselves .
<Sync time="106.645"/>
but also ,
<Sync time="107.940"/>
how is this different than letting people choose to participate in other dangerous sports ?
<Sync time="112.540"/>
in american football , many athletes have career-ending concussions and suffer from long-term brain damage .
<Sync time="118.640"/>
yet no american would propose seriously that we get rid of the sport .
<Sync time="122.350"/>
how is boxing any different ?
<Sync time="124.080"/>
it may be slightly more dangerous but at that point ,
<Sync time="126.765"/>
it just seems like a matter of punishing one sport arbitrarily
<Sync time="130.440"/>
while allowing other sports to go on .
<Sync time="132.770"/>
in her past speech , rachel criticized
<Sync time="135.760"/>
boxing because she felt that people would retire from the sport
<Sync time="138.980"/>
and not have a good career afterwards ,
<Sync time="141.250"/>
but this is a problem for soccer players and basketball players as well .
<Sync time="144.930"/>
many of them retire
<Sync time="146.180"/>
or aren't able to play professionally and have to find another career .
<Sync time="149.710"/>
we just don't think this is a problem that's worth banning boxing .
<Sync time="152.705"/>
it's a problem that's more endemic to sport .
<Sync time="155.605"/>

<Sync time="156.360"/>
our second argument is that boxing provides a structured and stylized way for people to express violence .
<Sync time="163.270"/>
violence is a part of human culture .
<Sync time="165.990"/>
people experience some sort of cathartic reaction to seeing violence in media
<Sync time="171.000"/>
or entertainment .
<Sync time="172.530"/>
there's a reason why people like watching
<Sync time="174.510"/>
" saving private ryan " , even though it has that very violent
<Sync time="177.460"/>
introduction sequence to the movie .
<Sync time="179.620"/>
in the same way , people like watching boxing .
<Sync time="182.450"/>
violence may not be part of their own life , but they have some sort of
<Sync time="185.830"/>
desire to engage with violence , and boxing is a safe
<Sync time="189.615"/>
uh way to do so , and ultimately preferable to other violent sports we tell you , where people are more likely to be seriously injured
<Sync time="196.550"/>
or that are less regulated . so we think that boxing has an important role
<Sync time="200.375"/>
in our society as a way for people to express themselves through violence
<Sync time="203.920"/>
in an ultimately constructive and regulated way
<Sync time="206.850"/>
rather than lashing out otherwise .
<Sync time="209.000"/>
not every boxer is floyd mayweather . we don't think that
<Sync time="211.920"/>
boxing makes people horrible human beings .
<Sync time="214.440"/>
we think that if anything , it provides
<Sync time="216.275"/>
an outlet for some people to express violence who might otherwise express it in a more negative way .
<Sync time="221.700"/>
and lastly , we would argue that banning boxing would do a disservice to cultures where it's uniquely important .
<Sync time="227.430"/>
if you think about
<Sync time="228.540"/>
filipinos , many
<Sync time="229.955"/>
filipinos greatly love boxing and it's a very popular sport there .
<Sync time="233.800"/>
manny pacquiao
<Sync time="234.960"/>
obviously is a filipino national hero .
<Sync time="237.860"/>
so we think that ultimately the harms of this would fall disproportionately on certain cultures
<Sync time="242.240"/>
that value boxing more highly
<Sync time="244.020"/>
and that this is unfair to those groups .
<Sync time="246.365"/>
for all these reasons , we should not ban boxing .
<Sync time="249.240"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="250.169"/>
