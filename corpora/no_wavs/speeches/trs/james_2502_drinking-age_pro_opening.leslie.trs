we should lower the drinking age .
<Sync time="2.590"/>
so we're going to argue that in jurisdictions
<Sync time="5.535"/>
where the drinking age is higher than the age of majority ,
<Sync time="8.340"/>
it should be lowered to the age of majority .
<Sync time="10.750"/>
so , in america , it should be lowered from twenty-one to eighteen ,
<Sync time="14.150"/>
in ontario , it should be lowered from nineteen to
<Sync time="16.670"/>
eighteen ,
<Sync time="17.450"/>
and so on .
<Sync time="19.050"/>
three arguments for our side today .
<Sync time="21.370"/>
first :
<Sync time="22.140"/>
we think that the law needs to be principally consistent in order to be legitimate .
<Sync time="27.540"/>
right now in
<Sync time="28.610"/>
the u_s , in ontario , in other regions around the world ,
<Sync time="31.820"/>
you can vote as soon as you reach the age of majority .
<Sync time="35.640"/>
you can serve in the military ,
<Sync time="37.150"/>
sometimes against your will ,
<Sync time="38.580"/>
you can get a job , you can buy a car or a house ,
<Sync time="41.310"/>
but you can't buy a beer .
<Sync time="43.330"/>
we think that ultimately
<Sync time="44.715"/>
you undermine the effectiveness of the law , when it appears
<Sync time="47.840"/>
arbitrary in people's eyes .
<Sync time="49.680"/>
if people think that the law is arbitrary , they're more likely to disrespect it . if they think that the law
<Sync time="54.280"/>
is fair and just , then they're more likely to respect it .
<Sync time="58.000"/>
so right now , when people can't buy a beer but they can buy
<Sync time="61.105"/>
a shotgun in america ,
<Sync time="63.135"/>
we think that people think the law's absurd , and this tells them that the law is not something that they need to respect
<Sync time="68.145"/>
in a very
<Sync time="68.990"/>
%hes high way .
<Sync time="70.455"/>
so we think that ultimately ,
<Sync time="71.900"/>
because of the high prevalence of underage drinking
<Sync time="74.500"/>
which is impossible to prevent ,
<Sync time="76.125"/>
you undermine respect for the law , in general ,
<Sync time="78.620"/>
and create a culture where people try to avoid the law
<Sync time="81.340"/>
and get out of doing things that are legal that is extremely widespread .
<Sync time="85.280"/>
probably ,
<Sync time="86.005"/>
a large majority of american and ontari-
<Sync time="88.970"/>
canadian teenagers drink
<Sync time="90.520"/>
long before they reach the age when they're permitted to .
<Sync time="93.285"/>
if the law were principally consistent , we think more people would have respect for the law and you wouldn't have that culture .
<Sync time="98.950"/>
so ultimately , we should lower the drinking age
<Sync time="101.110"/>
for that reason . if someone can buy a gun .
<Sync time="103.350"/>
we say let them buy a beer .
<Sync time="105.425"/>

<Sync time="106.155"/>
our second argument is about personal freedom .
<Sync time="109.070"/>
realize that the people we're discussing in this debate are all adults .
<Sync time="112.450"/>
we trust them to make other decisions on their own well-being ,
<Sync time="115.250"/>
for instance ,
<Sync time="116.010"/>
what kind of healthcare they want to have , what education they want to pursue .
<Sync time="119.765"/>
they're past the age at which the state is making decisions for them ,
<Sync time="123.080"/>
like making them go to high school .
<Sync time="125.610"/>
we think that , with this in mind , it's important that we defer to
<Sync time="128.530"/>
individual freedom for a few reasons .
<Sync time="130.905"/>
one :
<Sync time="131.920"/>
drinking doesn't really harm anyone else . it's a personal decision .
<Sync time="135.320"/>
remember that drunk driving is illegal
<Sync time="137.350"/>
either way .
<Sync time="138.700"/>
at that point , we think that governments , in general , should defer to letting people make their own decisions if no one else is at risk .
<Sync time="145.210"/>
the reason this is true
<Sync time="146.545"/>
is that people know their own interests better than anyone else knows their interest .
<Sync time="150.600"/>
there's a poverty of information
<Sync time="152.925"/>
that you and i have about any third person .
<Sync time="155.765"/>
they know facts about their own life that we don't have access to .
<Sync time="159.160"/>
they know about their own experiences in a way that we never will .
<Sync time="162.600"/>
with that in mind , we should defer to letting these individuals
<Sync time="165.415"/>
make their own decisions about whether alcohol consumption is right for them .
<Sync time="169.380"/>
and i think it's quite likely that if you gave people this freedom and respect , that things like binge drinking culture would actually decrease ,
<Sync time="175.935"/>
because people would be empowered to make responsible decisions
<Sync time="179.320"/>
rather than encouraged to make irresponsible ones ,
<Sync time="181.660"/>
like drinking too much or drinking
<Sync time="183.660"/>
illegally .
<Sync time="184.790"/>

<Sync time="185.425"/>
our third argument today
<Sync time="187.395"/>
is that we are opposed to public morality , in general .
<Sync time="191.400"/>
the main case for making it more difficult for young people to buy alcohol
<Sync time="195.495"/>
is that certain parts of the population think it's immoral to drink alcohol or to drink alcohol in excess .
<Sync time="202.040"/>
we think , again , that individuals should be free to make their own decisions .
<Sync time="205.910"/>
if certain christians in america and canada
<Sync time="208.640"/>
don't want to drink alcohol in excess or don't want to drink at all
<Sync time="211.880"/>
or don't want to drink until they're older ,
<Sync time="213.960"/>
those people should have every right and freedom to do so ,
<Sync time="216.985"/>
but they shouldn't be able to impose their will on people of other religions ,
<Sync time="220.560"/>
who don't have these particular beliefs .
<Sync time="223.850"/>
we think that , 
<Sync time="224.502"/>
in effect ,
<Sync time="225.320"/>
higher drinking ages are a form of morality that's imposed on the general public and that this is not the role of the state .
<Sync time="231.870"/>
ultimately , the government should protect people from each other .
<Sync time="234.650"/>
it should uphold the law ,
<Sync time="235.995"/>
but the law that it implements should recognize individuals' own autonomy
<Sync time="239.445"/>
and not apply
<Sync time="240.590"/>
one form of viewing the world
<Sync time="243.240"/>
or one way of life
<Sync time="244.400"/>
onto everyone .
<Sync time="245.620"/>
for these reasons , we should lower the drinking age .
<Sync time="248.440"/>
thank you .
