we should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp .
<Sync time="4.760"/>
we're going to explain to you why the united states
<Sync time="7.195"/>
should continue to operate gitmo
<Sync time="9.610"/>
and should
<Sync time="10.365"/>
continue the programs that are under way there , including the c_i_a torture program .
<Sync time="15.710"/>
three arguments :
<Sync time="16.920"/>
the first is that the alternative to closing guantanamo bay is not better than the status quo .
<Sync time="23.300"/>
tim tries to tell you in his speech that if we close guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="27.080"/>
the c_i_a will stop torturing people , the u_s navy will stop interring people
<Sync time="31.685"/>
without trial ,
<Sync time="32.870"/>
and ultimately these people will either be set free or given fair and free trials .
<Sync time="37.450"/>
i just don't think that this is a realistic alternative world to the one in which we live .
<Sync time="42.850"/>
there is no incentive for the u_s government to end the torture program .
<Sync time="47.070"/>
yes , there has been backlash against it , but it was relatively minor
<Sync time="50.780"/>
and ultimately has blown over , especially since the trump election .
<Sync time="54.250"/>
and on top of that , presumably the u_s government gained something from the torture program ,
<Sync time="59.350"/>
whether that be
<Sync time="60.245"/>
making people afraid to interfere with u_s business
<Sync time="63.550"/>
or perhaps obtaining some information that they otherwise don't have .
<Sync time="67.145"/>
if they didn't gain anything from it , then i think it's unlikely the c_i_a would spend money
<Sync time="71.420"/>
on this program .
<Sync time="72.735"/>
so with that in mind , i think it's quite likely that they'll just continue the program ,
<Sync time="76.680"/>
and what would it look like without guantanamo bay ?
<Sync time="79.285"/>
the u_s operates many torture facilities around the world . perhaps you remember
<Sync time="84.165"/>
the scandal at abu gharib a few years ago
<Sync time="86.850"/>
where u_s
<Sync time="88.060"/>
s- , i believe it was the navy , were mistreating
<Sync time="90.190"/>
prisoners and torturing them to get information .
<Sync time="93.390"/>
if you close guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="95.620"/>
all that happens is they do the torture in saudi arabia or some other country .
<Sync time="99.730"/>
at the end of the day , it doesn't really matter where it happens .
<Sync time="102.660"/>
but at least with guantanamo , this is in the news and the american people are aware of it .
<Sync time="107.110"/>
there's some degree of oversight .
<Sync time="109.130"/>
if this all takes place at some black site in poland ,
<Sync time="112.000"/>
then the potential for abuse is much greater ,
<Sync time="114.340"/>
and ultimately we tell you that the situation could grow even worse than it is right now .
<Sync time="118.910"/>
torture , unfortunately , seems to be a fact of life for people who are held
<Sync time="122.755"/>
in these navy and c_i_a prisons ,
<Sync time="124.835"/>
and it seems that that's unlikely to go away .
<Sync time="127.630"/>
our second argument
<Sync time="129.125"/>
is that it is politically infeasible to close guantanamo bay .
<Sync time="132.860"/>

<Sync time="133.410"/>
recognize that this action doesn't take place in a vacuum .
<Sync time="136.460"/>
if you close gitmo ,
<Sync time="137.720"/>
either you have to move these people to black sites ,
<Sync time="140.330"/>
basically disappear them ,
<Sync time="141.920"/>
which seems quite likely to cause backlash in the liberal media
<Sync time="145.250"/>
and ultimately create more resentment of the government and of the c_i_a among the kind of
<Sync time="150.115"/>
liberal ,
<Sync time="151.235"/>
big city east coast types who care about these things .
<Sync time="154.850"/>
ultimately , we tell you that there's no reason for any administration to take on that backlash
<Sync time="159.680"/>
when people seem perfectly willing to ignore guantanamo
<Sync time="162.575"/>
for the most part .
<Sync time="163.965"/>
we think ultimately this would just burn good political will for the administration .
<Sync time="168.105"/>
or alternatively you could try to move these people to america , like barack obama did .
<Sync time="173.070"/>
but every single governor refused to have these people come to their state because they don't want to bring
<Sync time="178.340"/>
nine eleven hijackers into their community .
<Sync time="180.990"/>
so at the end of the day , we think that it's likely that you would get similar backlash and have the same problems
<Sync time="185.820"/>
if you try to bring them to america .
<Sync time="187.760"/>
so we just don't think that there's any good way to do this without burning a lot of political will
<Sync time="192.160"/>
on an issue that most americans , to be frank ,
<Sync time="194.490"/>
don't care about .
<Sync time="196.100"/>

<Sync time="196.840"/>
our third and final argument is that
<Sync time="199.020"/>
these concessions to cuba would weaken our soft power .
<Sync time="202.400"/>
cuba has wanted america to leave the guantanamo bay base
<Sync time="206.245"/>
since
<Sync time="206.900"/>
nineteen fifty nine , or whenever
<Sync time="208.855"/>
uh the castros came to power .
<Sync time="211.200"/>
we tell you that ultimately
<Sync time="212.705"/>
if you make concessions to cuba , you weaken american soft power .
<Sync time="216.455"/>
the ability of a very strong country to say , " we will do whatever we want in your territory and you can't stop us " ,
<Sync time="222.720"/>
is one way that nations like the u_s dissuade anyone from disagreeing
<Sync time="226.300"/>
with their hegemony .
<Sync time="227.830"/>
we see the same thing in germany or in japan : that the u_s bases there
<Sync time="231.840"/>
provide a way for the u_s to leverage their position as a global hegemon .
<Sync time="235.780"/>
even if the navy remains in guantanamo bay ,
<Sync time="238.210"/>
removing the prison camp is a major concession to the cubans ,
<Sync time="241.360"/>
who have called it a human rights abuse ,
<Sync time="243.275"/>
and ultimately undermines our negotiating position in the region and perhaps globally .
<Sync time="247.830"/>
so for all these reasons , we should not close the guantanamo bay detention camp .
<Sync time="252.140"/>
thank you .
