we should adopt
<Sync time="1.260"/>
atheism .
<Sync time="2.350"/>
by this we mean
<Sync time="3.335"/>
that people living in western countries today
<Sync time="6.160"/>
or highly developed countries today
<Sync time="8.210"/>
should not believe in a god .
<Sync time="10.280"/>
so
<Sync time="11.015"/>
we're agnostic on other forms of supernatural phenomena , but we're arguing that you shouldn't believe in the christian god or allah
<Sync time="17.710"/>
or similar beings .
<Sync time="19.285"/>
three arguments .
<Sync time="20.590"/>
the first is about
<Sync time="22.010"/>
empiricism .
<Sync time="23.195"/>
this is the idea that we should base our beliefs based on what we can observe in the physical universe .
<Sync time="28.850"/>
this is the idea that underlies the scientific revolution that's created the world that we live in today .
<Sync time="34.290"/>

<Sync time="34.975"/>
there is no empirical evidence for the existence of god
<Sync time="38.380"/>
despite the best efforts of many very intelligent people
<Sync time="41.290"/>
to prove that there is . i'm reminded of the famous words of
<Sync time="44.345"/>
yuri gagarin when he first went into space ,
<Sync time="46.910"/>
i looked and looked but i did not see god .
<Sync time="49.750"/>
ultimately the physical universe
<Sync time="52.160"/>
has , to date , been able to be explained through natural phenomena ,
<Sync time="55.470"/>
with no need to resort
<Sync time="56.830"/>
to supernatural phenomena
<Sync time="58.520"/>
for an explanation .
<Sync time="60.430"/>
what that means is that for people who want to define god as the explanation for what we don't know ,
<Sync time="65.000"/>
god becomes an ever shrinking pocket of scientific ignorance .
<Sync time="68.860"/>
but what's more , we tell you that it's also problematic to base our ideas of god based on
<Sync time="73.615"/>
the absence of knowledge .
<Sync time="75.680"/>
short of any positive evidence for the existence of god , we tell you that we ought differ to not believing in him .
<Sync time="82.040"/>
this type of thinking has been successful in uncovering various scientific advancements in the past
<Sync time="86.540"/>
and generally advancing society .
<Sync time="88.375"/>
so we think that it's a good standard to apply in this instance as well .
<Sync time="92.150"/>
lacking any positive evidence for the existence of god ,
<Sync time="95.230"/>
we should adopt atheism .
<Sync time="98.180"/>
our second argument concerns truth .
<Sync time="100.830"/>
so
<Sync time="101.390"/>
essentially we tell you that you ought make a good faith attempt to believe what is true .
<Sync time="106.630"/>
we think that this is important because if people don't attempt to believe the truth , then it's difficult to form a consensus about how people ought live ,
<Sync time="114.120"/>
act , or behave .
<Sync time="115.605"/>
if everyone determines their own ,
<Sync time="118.250"/>
effectively
<Sync time="118.940"/>
arbitrary standards for what is and is not true ,
<Sync time="121.940"/>
then ultimately people have difficulty communicating with one another .
<Sync time="125.000"/>
but by pursuing the actual truth , or the highest truth available to us , we can all come to common ground .
<Sync time="130.730"/>
with that in mind we tell you that there are a few reasons not to believe in god .
<Sync time="134.790"/>
i've already spoken about empiricism and the lack of physical evidence for god ,
<Sync time="138.930"/>
but we'd also like to point out that people probably ought be skeptical about new claims .
<Sync time="144.140"/>
consider the following ,
<Sync time="146.000"/>
it is not impossible that there is a giant
<Sync time="148.360"/>
teapot
<Sync time="149.010"/>
behind the planet jupiter ,
<Sync time="150.490"/>
always blocked from sight on earth
<Sync time="152.490"/>
by the planet ,
<Sync time="153.555"/>
and invisible to probes chance after as to when they went by the planet jupiter .
<Sync time="158.570"/>
but no one believes in this because people apply a certain standard of skepticism .
<Sync time="162.770"/>
if someone makes a tremendous claim with no physical evidence ,
<Sync time="165.630"/>
the burden is on them to back it up .
<Sync time="168.100"/>
similarly we think the burden is on people who believe in god to prove that he does exist . because the idea that
<Sync time="173.470"/>
there's a super powerful being
<Sync time="175.180"/>
that created the universe
<Sync time="176.650"/>
baffles the mind . it is not inherently intuitive , it's something that's culturally constructed
<Sync time="181.275"/>
and we think that it needs to be proven before anyone ought believe it if they're concerned with believing what is true .
<Sync time="187.980"/>
our third and final argument is about the problem of evil . and this effectively
<Sync time="192.200"/>
rules out belief in a christian or muslim style god .
<Sync time="196.310"/>
basically
<Sync time="197.015"/>
christians and muslims believe that god is all knowing ,
<Sync time="199.730"/>
all powerful ,
<Sync time="200.750"/>
and omni-benevolent , which is to say always good .
<Sync time="204.310"/>
yet ,
<Sync time="204.860"/>
the world is an evil place full of horrible things that happened to innocent people . 
<Sync time="209.440"/>
so it is impossible then that there is a god who
<Sync time="212.130"/>
knows and understands all these things ,
<Sync time="214.320"/>
omniscience ,
<Sync time="215.200"/>
has the power to stop them or not to have created them in the first place ,
<Sync time="219.100"/>
omnipotence , and is always good ,
<Sync time="221.370"/>
omni-benevolent , because that being ,
<Sync time="223.325"/>
being always good ,
<Sync time="224.730"/>
would choose not to have things like
<Sync time="226.415"/>
hunger or genocide
<Sync time="228.075"/>
in the world that we live in .
<Sync time="229.770"/>
but at that point where we observe those phenomena in the real world , we think it's clear that that god
<Sync time="233.985"/>
does not exist .
<Sync time="235.590"/>
and since this is the god that most people globally believe in , we think that
<Sync time="239.100"/>
ultimately we should be atheist rather than believe in such a being .
<Sync time="242.640"/>
for these reasons we should adopt atheism .
<Sync time="245.200"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="245.799"/>
