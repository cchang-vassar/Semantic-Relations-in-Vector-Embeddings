<Sync time="0.945"/>
we should introduce universal health care
<Sync time="3.690"/>
because it's both a moral responsibility
<Sync time="6.345"/>
and smart policy .
<Sync time="8.180"/>
so let's start by talking about why the introduction of universal healthcare
<Sync time="12.495"/>
is a a moral responsibility ,
<Sync time="15.025"/>
and i think that a lot of this comes down to the very basic idea that
<Sync time="19.880"/>
people suffer , 
<Sync time="21.090"/>
people die , and if we have the ability to help them ,
<Sync time="24.790"/>
it's worthwhile to do so .
<Sync time="26.650"/>
there's a whole lot of reasons for this . it could be because if we were in that
<Sync time="30.430"/>
desperate situation , we would want that help .
<Sync time="32.695"/>
it's because it's just a basic level of empathy that um
<Sync time="36.200"/>
we don't want to see people in pain .
<Sync time="38.720"/>
uh at the end of the day , i think it's just the idea that
<Sync time="41.975"/>
um this is a kind of suffering that we can prevent at ,
<Sync time="44.835"/>
honestly , not that much of a sacrifice , and it's therefore worth the
<Sync time="48.650"/>
cost .
<Sync time="49.280"/>
and i think that it's only about healthcare that we really look at these things in that way .
<Sync time="54.940"/>
if you look at the idea that police officers shouldn't help people who are poor because they don't have as much of an ability
<Sync time="61.785"/>
to fund police departments via taxes and things like that ,
<Sync time="65.620"/>
most people would probably agree that's a kind of ridiculous concept
<Sync time="68.825"/>
because , of course , uh
<Sync time="70.390"/>
like police officers should be um
<Sync time="72.515"/>
helping prevent crime . like
<Sync time="74.130"/>
if a poor person is getting murdered , that's not any worse than if a rich person is getting murdered ,
<Sync time="78.890"/>
and i think that that's not all that different from healthcare .
<Sync time="82.080"/>
possibly um
<Sync time="83.010"/>
like getting shot by a weapon or things like that
<Sync time="85.920"/>
isn't you're going to be just as dead if you're going to die of cancer , but you can't afford a lot of the treatment
<Sync time="91.210"/>
because you don't have health insurance and these things aren't covered ,
<Sync time="93.905"/>
and
<Sync time="94.745"/>
it's not going to make all that much of a difference to you how it happens to you . and i think that we're talking about human lives and this is
<Sync time="100.675"/>
very important is on a moral level .
<Sync time="103.070"/>
but
<Sync time="104.245"/>
the next thing that i want to talk about is about
<Sync time="106.705"/>
why i think that this is smart on a policy level .
<Sync time="109.350"/>
and in most places uh around the world ,
<Sync time="112.860"/>
um
<Sync time="113.475"/>
espe- if it's an emergency situation , hospitals are going to just turn you down
<Sync time="118.150"/>
uh based on an inability to pay . they may discharge you
<Sync time="121.030"/>
earlier , you may get more limited treatment options ,
<Sync time="124.050"/>
but they're still going to take you in .
<Sync time="125.630"/>
um if you're like having a severe medical crisis , um
<Sync time="128.910"/>
hospitals are gonna do that and
<Sync time="130.510"/>
espe-
<Sync time="131.445"/>
at least in places like america .
<Sync time="133.360"/>
and that's a problem because oftenti- i-
<Sync time="136.575"/>
preventative care is less expensive
<Sync time="139.640"/>
than dealing with the consequences
<Sync time="141.735"/>
uh
<Sync time="142.240"/>
in both like hard terms and softer terms .
<Sync time="145.020"/>
in hard terms in that it just often costs less money to do regular checkups , regular screenings ,
<Sync time="150.780"/>
uh removing things maybe before they become cancerous or the like ,
<Sync time="155.200"/>
uh making sure that you uh
<Sync time="156.820"/>
have access to like um
<Sync time="158.120"/>
a healthier lifestyle .
<Sync time="159.940"/>
all of that is ultimately
<Sync time="161.660"/>
uh better for someone's life
<Sync time="163.260"/>
um and wallet
<Sync time="165.040"/>
and the state's wallet
<Sync time="166.550"/>
than having to deal with
<Sync time="167.710"/>
incredibly hefty medical bills
<Sync time="169.820"/>
from specialized care as a result of
<Sync time="172.450"/>
um lack of
<Sync time="174.070"/>
preventative treatment .
<Sync time="176.420"/>
but in addition to that , it's also better in a a broader soense in that
<Sync time="180.290"/>
obviously uh it's not great for the economy
<Sync time="183.070"/>
if a lot of people are getting sicker more often ,
<Sync time="185.690"/>
if people are dying more often , and things like that .
<Sync time="188.055"/>
like when people put off
<Sync time="189.800"/>
care um in earlier parts of their life ,
<Sync time="192.290"/>
it makes things like uh , in america ,
<Sync time="194.460"/>
medicare for older people
<Sync time="196.320"/>
um or specific support for elderly people ,
<Sync time="198.955"/>
or um
<Sync time="199.860"/>
it burdens employers who uh
<Sync time="201.880"/>
whose employees
<Sync time="202.920"/>
can't work as much .
<Sync time="204.035"/>
all of these things uh add up in cost and since
<Sync time="206.985"/>
uh health is something that affects everyone ,
<Sync time="209.840"/>
um
<Sync time="210.220"/>
it has an incredibly massive effect on e-
<Sync time="213.285"/>
on an economy ,
<Sync time="214.595"/>
and it ultimately results in money just getting wasted and lives getting destroyed .
<Sync time="219.120"/>
and for all those reasons , we should introduce universal healthcare .
<Sync time="223.889"/>
