i'm proud to oppose the motion that we should abolish the anti social behavioral disorders .
<Sync time="5.660"/>
so broadly our you know concern here is that we decrease anti social behavior .
<Sync time="11.350"/>
we think that anti social behavior is particularly problematic because
<Sync time="15.520"/>
unlike most other types of criminal offenses which are you know very clear cut um you know like robbing a store for example is like
<Sync time="22.990"/>
it's pretty clear to define what constitutes robbing a store
<Sync time="26.790"/>
antisocial behavior is much harder to pin down
<Sync time="29.945"/>
and as such it's harder to crack down upon with the type of like legal constraints and protections that government is discussing .
<Sync time="37.110"/>
none the less we still think it has profound impacts .
<Sync time="39.890"/>
something like for example being a nuisance in a public square
<Sync time="43.930"/>
um has a pretty
<Sync time="45.555"/>
tangible impact on a lot of the people that are occupying that public space .
<Sync time="50.760"/>
um you know
<Sync time="51.540"/>
playing your music really loud has an effect on your neighbors both in terms of the irritation it generates but also in terms of their
<Sync time="57.920"/>
ability to sleep
<Sync time="58.950"/>
things like that .
<Sync time="60.200"/>
so we think that
<Sync time="61.275"/>
criminal law should be concerned
<Sync time="63.240"/>
uh principally
<Sync time="64.380"/>
with mitigating damage upon innocent people and preventing them from experiencing harm even if the harm is somewhat minimal .
<Sync time="71.465"/>
at that point then we think that anti social behavioral disorders are uniquely equipped to deal with that .
<Sync time="77.770"/>
three independent points pertaining to the mechanisms by which the anti social behavioral disorders
<Sync time="82.870"/>
mitigate the proliferation
<Sync time="84.530"/>
of anti social behavior .
<Sync time="86.680"/>
first is that it acts as a deterrent
<Sync time="88.920"/>
so
<Sync time="89.460"/>
we think that oftentimes people who are going to engage in particular behaviors
<Sync time="93.935"/>
do so on a cost benefit analysis .
<Sync time="96.330"/>
if i'm going to rob a store for example
<Sync time="98.580"/>
i'm less likely to do it if i you know fear that i'm going to be penalized for it .
<Sync time="102.845"/>
i think that robbery would be much more common if it wasn't a crime .
<Sync time="106.570"/>
likewise with even you know smaller offenses that presumably bring even less benefit to the individual person
<Sync time="113.510"/>
there is a significant deterrent created by a potential looming uh
<Sync time="117.695"/>
penalty
<Sync time="119.035"/>
that is to say that
<Sync time="120.570"/>
you know i might really like sitting out on my porch and playing music off my gramophone loudly
<Sync time="125.830"/>
but i'm way less likely to do it
<Sync time="128.200"/>
if there's actually like a
<Sync time="129.380"/>
criminal penalty for doing so .
<Sync time="131.890"/>
so we think that laws like this
<Sync time="133.730"/>
create a significant capacity for people to say oh i'm not going to do that because there's like this ridiculous fine or this ridiculous penalty that might be levied against me if i do so .
<Sync time="144.850"/>
secondly we think that the anti social behavioral disorders are more adaptable than typical criminal law .
<Sync time="152.020"/>
so specifically government takes issue with the broadness of these laws but we think that that's good because of how difficult
<Sync time="158.620"/>
antisocial behavior is to pin down .
<Sync time="161.160"/>
a lot of the time the specific action that creates a nuisance is different
<Sync time="165.205"/>
and as such it's hard to create a consistent law passed by the legislature in a timely fashion
<Sync time="170.750"/>
that
<Sync time="171.110"/>
appropriately responds to these public nuisances .
<Sync time="174.125"/>
we think having a broadly applicable and sort of like
<Sync time="177.170"/>
adaptable flexible law
<Sync time="179.395"/>
is good to ensure
<Sync time="181.330"/>
that we actually have the capacity in the legal infrastructure
<Sync time="185.265"/>
to crackdown on these behaviors .
<Sync time="187.600"/>
absent that flexibility
<Sync time="189.210"/>
we think that law enforcement is just going to be inherently l-
<Sync time="192.420"/>
poor more poorly equipped
<Sync time="194.220"/>
to deal with anti social behavior .
<Sync time="196.515"/>
and our third point
<Sync time="198.355"/>
is that um these orders are
<Sync time="200.800"/>
you know just good at blocking people from doing these things .
<Sync time="204.075"/>
a lot of the time antisocial behavior is often conducted by a specific group of people
<Sync time="209.620"/>
so the gramophones thing is often done by more elderly people um like this is the typical example for when the anti social behavioral orders
<Sync time="217.885"/>
are like often implemented .
<Sync time="219.690"/>
and because you have the capacity to in a criminal court
<Sync time="223.210"/>
basically put a restraining order on the activity prevent people from doing it
<Sync time="227.550"/>
we think that that
<Sync time="228.430"/>
then increases you know
<Sync time="229.930"/>
the ability to stop people from doing it because you could actually put you know
<Sync time="234.210"/>
um a specific legal document down saying you can't do this anymore
<Sync time="238.550"/>
so that ensures that the harm generated by set action
<Sync time="241.685"/>
occurs less frequently . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="244.883"/>
