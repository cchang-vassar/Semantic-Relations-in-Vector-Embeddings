we should not disband
<Sync time="2.080"/>
nato .
<Sync time="2.935"/>
we think that it's important to keep in mind that the comparative in this round
<Sync time="6.660"/>
is a world with a strong alliance of democratic states
<Sync time="10.080"/>
who use their military and influence to promote democracy around the world ,
<Sync time="14.210"/>
versus a world in which all of these countries
<Sync time="16.200"/>
act independently without common policy .
<Sync time="18.815"/>
we don't think that nations like the united states or britain
<Sync time="21.465"/>
would just stop interacting with the rest of the world using their militaries because there were no nato  .
<Sync time="26.195"/>
we think that they would do it in a worse way .
<Sync time="29.050"/>
so two big arguments . the first is why we think nato promotes cooperation ,
<Sync time="33.185"/>
and ultimately this is a good thing .
<Sync time="35.640"/>
recognize that many of nato's member states like germany and britain used to be enemies but now are allies .
<Sync time="41.710"/>
after world war two the united states , probably the best thing we've ever done as a country ,
<Sync time="46.060"/>
forged this alliance out of the countries that used to plunge the world into war
<Sync time="49.830"/>
time and time again .
<Sync time="51.195"/>
the story of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is constant conflict in europe ,
<Sync time="55.500"/>
which is largely ended because
<Sync time="57.605"/>
under american leadership
<Sync time="59.120"/>
nato has created this alliance that forces all western european countries to work together .
<Sync time="63.670"/>
this has prevented massive amounts of conflict we think
<Sync time="66.040"/>
since world war two .
<Sync time="67.485"/>
but on top of that we think nato is good because it aligns american interest
<Sync time="71.490"/>
with those of other countries .
<Sync time="73.560"/>
so recognize that america's natural position in the world is perhaps
<Sync time="77.160"/>
isolationist . america is far away from most other countries ,
<Sync time="80.785"/>
and in many cases
<Sync time="82.140"/>
our interests are more uh commercial
<Sync time="84.530"/>
rather than
<Sync time="85.250"/>
interventionist around the world .
<Sync time="87.730"/>
but when the united states was uninvolved in the rest of the world
<Sync time="90.330"/>
other countries were much more powerful relative to their neighbors . we think that countries like russia
<Sync time="94.470"/>
and china would be much more powerful on the international sphere
<Sync time="97.680"/>
without american involvement .
<Sync time="99.470"/>
we think that it's preferable to have
<Sync time="101.070"/>
the united states as a very powerful democratic country ,
<Sync time="103.960"/>
take an active role in the world .
<Sync time="105.950"/>
as an american i'm going to be the first to admit that u_s action in countries like vietnam
<Sync time="110.005"/>
and iraq has been regrettable ,
<Sync time="111.550"/>
but we think that checking russia
<Sync time="113.040"/>
and russian and chinese aggression
<Sync time="114.980"/>
around the world is still a good thing ,
<Sync time="116.750"/>
and that there's no other country that would be able to do this the way the u_s can ,
<Sync time="119.980"/>
and that nato is uniquely what draws the u. s.
<Sync time="122.405"/>
into having an interest
<Sync time="123.580"/>
in protecting other countries democracies ,
<Sync time="125.685"/>
and spreading democracy
<Sync time="127.070"/>
around the world .
<Sync time="128.480"/>
we also think that the u_s is less likely to act
<Sync time="131.025"/>
unilaterally because of nato .
<Sync time="133.325"/>
now the other team might say look you invaded
<Sync time="135.745"/>
iraq using your coalition of the willing not nato ,
<Sync time="138.525"/>
but if you look at your members it's effectively the same group of countries .
<Sync time="141.925"/>
the comparative in this debate
<Sync time="143.380"/>
isn't that america will completely stop fighting other countries ,
<Sync time="146.420"/>
it's that we would do it without allies .
<Sync time="148.250"/>
if you think that the u_s abuses its power and now , it seems that it would be much worse
<Sync time="151.965"/>
if the u_s weren't beholden to any group of allies
<Sync time="154.500"/>
like they are through nato .
<Sync time="156.170"/>

<Sync time="156.750"/>
but aside from that we think that even non-members can benefit from nato action .
<Sync time="160.650"/>
the other team tells you that nato's interventions have largely been a failure ,
<Sync time="164.380"/>
but if you look at yugoslavia in the nineteen nineties , we think that the nato intervention
<Sync time="168.330"/>
ended the civil war much more quickly than any local power could have
<Sync time="171.740"/>
because the u_s and britain were more powerful
<Sync time="173.945"/>
than the countries actually fighting ,
<Sync time="175.750"/>
but on top of that we think that
<Sync time="177.425"/>
even though the accounts of genocide in the nineties were overblown ,
<Sync time="181.320"/>
now that we have the information we do now ,
<Sync time="183.230"/>
it's critical that when there were charges of genocide ,
<Sync time="185.980"/>
the u_s and britain and other countries went in
<Sync time="188.300"/>
to try to prevent that . we think that ultimately the world is a better place .
<Sync time="191.475"/>
if you have a group of countries that are willing to go to war
<Sync time="193.990"/>
to prevent a genocide .
<Sync time="195.450"/>
so therefore we think that nato interventions can actually be a good thing
<Sync time="198.640"/>
and protect people .
<Sync time="199.990"/>
now the other team might say you haven't gone into stoplights of other genocides ,
<Sync time="203.280"/>
but look the comparative is that
<Sync time="204.890"/>
they did intervene in yugoslavia
<Sync time="206.705"/>
where as no one else might have without nato .
<Sync time="208.975"/>

<Sync time="209.830"/>
aside from that we think that ultimately the big impact of all of these points is that nato creates peace .
<Sync time="214.960"/>
there's an old saying if you want peace prepare for war .
<Sync time="217.940"/>
by having the world's democracies work together to create strong militaries
<Sync time="221.735"/>
and a strong alliance network that makes any of them even the smaller countries
<Sync time="225.850"/>
like netherlands or
<Sync time="227.180"/>
norway too powerful to attack ,
<Sync time="229.310"/>
we think that ultimately there's less likely to be conflict .
<Sync time="231.910"/>

<Sync time="232.660"/>
so the second big point we think in this debate is that nato checks undemocratic nations .
<Sync time="237.500"/>
yes
<Sync time="238.100"/>
nato threatens putin's russia ,
<Sync time="239.790"/>
but we think this is a good thing .
<Sync time="241.325"/>
if you think that right now
<Sync time="242.620"/>
putin despite the existence of an alliance of powerful democratic nations
<Sync time="246.850"/>
has still attacked georgia , has still attacked ukraine .
<Sync time="249.640"/>
we think that it's likely that he would have also attacked the baltics if it weren't for nato .
<Sync time="253.640"/>
we think that if anything the problem with nato is that it hasn't expanded east quickly enough .
<Sync time="257.735"/>
and you may say the u_s and britain do bad things , but at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="261.265"/>
we still think that it's better to live in countries
<Sync time="263.370"/>
influenced by the u_s and britain than countries influenced by putin's russia
<Sync time="266.865"/>
in terms of quality of life and freedom for the people who live there .
<Sync time="270.340"/>
and aside from that we think that nato is the main way in which democratic countries cooperate .
<Sync time="274.820"/>
so if you want a powerful check on
<Sync time="277.130"/>
undemocratic nations around the world
<Sync time="279.090"/>
like russia ,
<Sync time="280.040"/>
like certain middle eastern dictatorships , like china ,
<Sync time="282.880"/>
nato is the only game in town .
<Sync time="285.210"/>
nato is the only group of democratic countries that have shown that they are willing to intervene
<Sync time="289.210"/>
to protect democracy around the world ,
<Sync time="291.230"/>
and while it may be unfortunate that lots of people have been harmed by their interventions ,
<Sync time="294.960"/>
we still think that a world where democracy is powerfully protected is better than a world where they block this champion .
<Sync time="300.535"/>
so for these reasons
<Sync time="301.550"/>
we should not disband nato .
<Sync time="303.360"/>
