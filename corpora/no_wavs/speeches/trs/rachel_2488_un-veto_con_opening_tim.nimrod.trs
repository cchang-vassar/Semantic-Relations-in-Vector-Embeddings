when tim says pretty things , like listing all of the different despots he thinks the u_n should take action against ,
<Sync time="6.810"/>
he forgets that were operating in the real world ,
<Sync time="9.685"/>
and that
<Sync time="10.335"/>
these kinds of ideas , such as
<Sync time="12.330"/>
mass , like
<Sync time="13.640"/>
regulation of different kinds of dictators
<Sync time="16.500"/>
require consistent backing , and the promise of a positive end results ,
<Sync time="20.800"/>
because in the end , we've seen what happens when intervention occurs ,
<Sync time="24.470"/>
and you don'tt stick it out till the end .
<Sync time="26.765"/>
we tell you that power vacuums , such as that which were created in iraq ,
<Sync time="30.340"/>
are
<Sync time="30.745"/>
more untenable than the dictators who existed previously ,
<Sync time="34.520"/>
and as such ,
<Sync time="35.590"/>
any active intervention should be one
<Sync time="37.665"/>
that is carefully planned ,
<Sync time="39.450"/>
plotted , and known to be successful .
<Sync time="42.050"/>
we just don't think this is something that the security council of the u_n
<Sync time="45.445"/>
can
<Sync time="45.865"/>
actively provide , or promise ,
<Sync time="48.710"/>
and this is why we think that the veto is very important .
<Sync time="51.240"/>
because , just like tim ,
<Sync time="53.090"/>
sometimes
<Sync time="53.950"/>
individual countries get carried away , and think that they can stomach and chew
<Sync time="58.280"/>
more than they actually can .
<Sync time="60.365"/>

<Sync time="60.945"/>
when this happens , we think that the five main members
<Sync time="64.140"/>
are good
<Sync time="64.875"/>
at
<Sync time="65.350"/>
pinpointing when these funds don't exist , when the political motives don't exist ,
<Sync time="69.390"/>
and saying : take a step back ,
<Sync time="71.320"/>
maybe these call outs aren't necessary .
<Sync time="73.950"/>
two many areas of clash , the first on why we think
<Sync time="76.715"/>
the purpose of the security council ,
<Sync time="78.690"/>
and the u_n at large , is about staying a
<Sync time="80.890"/>
treaty and discourse
<Sync time="82.490"/>
based group ,
<Sync time="83.655"/>
and allowing these nations to come together
<Sync time="85.935"/>
and have discourse .
<Sync time="87.570"/>
we think that in order to maintain a
<Sync time="89.905"/>
dogma of discourse , you need to have an unwillingness to enter violent conflict ,
<Sync time="94.240"/>
because otherwise , you're no longer discussing the conflicts that you're entering into ,
<Sync time="98.160"/>
rather you are just saying :
<Sync time="99.455"/>
this is a bad situation , we can send forces in
<Sync time="102.095"/>
to fix it .
<Sync time="103.140"/>
but more than this , we think it is good to think
<Sync time="105.530"/>
thoroughly through these kinds of proposals ,
<Sync time="107.580"/>
because multiple vetos mean that these proposals go back on the floor , and reenter discussion ,
<Sync time="112.900"/>
and we think that the sixth version of a car-
<Sync time="115.590"/>
given proposal is always going to be better
<Sync time="118.050"/>
than the first version .
<Sync time="119.345"/>
and the only thing they're doing , on their side of the house ,
<Sync time="121.840"/>
is making it easier
<Sync time="123.090"/>
for less thought out plans to go through .
<Sync time="126.110"/>

<Sync time="126.735"/>
more than this though , we think that you increase politicking
<Sync time="129.640"/>
on the u_n ,
<Sync time="130.530"/>
when you take away power , from those who see it as necessary , to them .
<Sync time="134.550"/>
we think that all that happens is that ,
<Sync time="136.560"/>
none of these five national security nations are going to be willing to give up their effective veto ,
<Sync time="142.195"/>
and so are going to exercise it to the manipulation of countries .
<Sync time="145.985"/>
we think that ,
<Sync time="146.645"/>
it's just much more likely that now ,
<Sync time="148.820"/>
they're going to go to swing votes ,
<Sync time="150.670"/>
or go to individual leaders of countries , and say that if you want our support in other matters ,
<Sync time="155.470"/>
if you want us to not undermine you ,
<Sync time="157.300"/>
in other global trade agreements , or global affairs ,
<Sync time="160.105"/>
you are not going to vote yes on this .
<Sync time="162.680"/>
we think this creates more tension ,
<Sync time="164.435"/>
and also leads to the pitting of countries
<Sync time="166.550"/>
one against the other .
<Sync time="168.020"/>
at the point that 
<Sync time="169.045"/>
the u_s can blame
<Sync time="170.560"/>
any country that defers to china's opinion
<Sync time="172.975"/>
for not letting their proposal through ,
<Sync time="174.795"/>
those countries are more likely to get targeted ,
<Sync time="177.890"/>
meaning that this kind of tension
<Sync time="179.360"/>
is antithetical ,
<Sync time="180.650"/>
more so than anything else ,
<Sync time="182.120"/>
to the u_n's purpose .
<Sync time="184.280"/>
our second area of clash
<Sync time="185.600"/>
has to do with why these countries have earned their right to veto ,
<Sync time="189.065"/>
and why , if we take it away ,
<Sync time="191.500"/>
the impacts are much worse .
<Sync time="193.310"/>
we think that , even if it makes it harder to regulate these larger countries , it is true that these larger countries ,
<Sync time="199.035"/>
individually , provide more money
<Sync time="201.390"/>
to the u_n
<Sync time="202.440"/>
than any of the smaller countries .
<Sync time="204.480"/>
what this means is that , they are effectively
<Sync time="206.450"/>
buying their ability to choose where that money goes ,
<Sync time="209.895"/>
and if they do not believe that a conflict is worth it ,
<Sync time="212.685"/>
then they ought not be obligated to send their money , and their troops ,
<Sync time="216.710"/>
to that conflict .
<Sync time="218.285"/>

<Sync time="218.880"/>
but more than this , we think that the alternative , on their side of the house ,
<Sync time="221.915"/>
is that these countries just leave .
<Sync time="223.860"/>
because , in the end ,
<Sync time="224.940"/>
large superpowers have very little to gain
<Sync time="227.405"/>
from the united nations .
<Sync time="228.950"/>
they already have strong economies ,
<Sync time="231.050"/>
they don't need collaboration that mu- as much as
<Sync time="233.535"/>
other nations need collaboration with them .
<Sync time="235.670"/>
what this means is that , when they start feeling disrespected ,
<Sync time="238.460"/>
they leave , and the countries that are left
<Sync time="240.550"/>
don't get any kind of stan- don't aren't able to get anything done ,
<Sync time="244.140"/>
because they just don't have the same kind of funds ,
<Sync time="246.345"/>
and don't have the kind of organization .
<Sync time="248.490"/>
for these reasons , proud to oppose .
<Sync time="250.770"/>
