i am proud to oppose the motion that we should ban
<Sync time="3.290"/>
bullfighting .
<Sync time="4.500"/>
our first independent point
<Sync time="5.970"/>
regards
<Sync time="6.570"/>
human enjoyment .
<Sync time="7.715"/>
so , the fact that this is something that's , you know ,
<Sync time="9.930"/>
so heavily prevalent in spanish culture
<Sync time="12.285"/>
and so many people go to it
<Sync time="13.990"/>
um
<Sync time="14.410"/>
probably signals that a lot of people , you know , get a kick out of this , that they
<Sync time="18.125"/>
go to bullfighting events , and this is something they do , you know , with their family . this is just like , whatever ,
<Sync time="22.390"/>
casual sunday enjoyment .
<Sync time="24.560"/>
um that then ,
<Sync time="26.440"/>
you know , means that there is obviously like a tangible benefit to having this practice in place ,
<Sync time="31.610"/>
that , you know , people see this and much in the same way they might see a movie or go to a show , um
<Sync time="36.800"/>
this is something that they enjoy watching .
<Sync time="39.410"/>
given that then , there is certainly a human element of enjoyment to this
<Sync time="43.510"/>
um
<Sync time="43.945"/>
and at the point where you're weighing that against the animal's rights ,
<Sync time="47.215"/>
i think it's important to establish that animals probably don't have rights .
<Sync time="50.940"/>
um specifically gov sets up like this pain-pleasure {matric/metric} , but i think the problem is that rights don't come from pain and pleasure ,
<Sync time="58.380"/>
rather they come from sort of a um
<Sync time="60.710"/>
a position of higher order intelligence and specifically the capacity to become ,
<Sync time="65.255"/>
you know , self-aware
<Sync time="66.635"/>
and understand one's own preferences in a much more detailed fashion .
<Sync time="71.250"/>
at that point then , because humans do operate at higher order thinking levels ,
<Sync time="75.690"/>
um it makes sense to prioritize the wishes of humans ,
<Sync time="79.400"/>
even if the um
<Sync time="80.935"/>
the level of like suffering versus pleasure is , you know , disjunct .
<Sync time="85.480"/>
our second independent point regards culture .
<Sync time="87.780"/>
so i think much like the the raw enjoyment stemmed from this ,
<Sync time="90.810"/>
um this is like another benefit to humans that ,
<Sync time="93.290"/>
particularly within spain , um this is something that is deeply and historically ingrained into spanish culture ,
<Sync time="100.040"/>
and something that people fundamentally regard as a part of their identity .
<Sync time="103.960"/>
i think this is particularly what makes it a s- distinct benefit
<Sync time="107.415"/>
is that this is something that people
<Sync time="109.260"/>
specifically identify with and see as
<Sync time="111.775"/>
fundamentally important to their lives .
<Sync time="115.080"/>
i think at the point where
<Sync time="116.410"/>
someone's identity is tied up in a practice , it takes on a much more significant position ,
<Sync time="121.040"/>
because not only do they just get like enjoyment out of seeing this , but if it were to be banned people would be upset at like an existential level .
<Sync time="128.910"/>
i think
<Sync time="129.460"/>
identity is something that is fundamentally important to human beings insofar as it shapes our perception of who we are as individuals ,
<Sync time="136.815"/>
and insofar as it is that sort of like higher order preference , that it is something that people see as
<Sync time="142.045"/>
extremely important ,
<Sync time="143.930"/>
we should r- {ford/afford} extreme weight to it .
<Sync time="146.310"/>
i think even if like you or i don't particularly sympathize with bullfighting on that level ,
<Sync time="151.300"/>
understandings of significance and importance and relative benefits
<Sync time="155.215"/>
are often subjective
<Sync time="156.690"/>
and as such , if the individual people on the ground say this is something that's really , really massively important to them ,
<Sync time="163.140"/>
we should respect those wishes and respect those preferences .
<Sync time="166.860"/>
our third and final independent point is that
<Sync time="169.730"/>
making bullfighting illegal , because it is so heavily demanded , will simply result in underground bullfighting .
<Sync time="176.020"/>
an analogous example in much of central america ,
<Sync time="179.220"/>
and even in spain itself ,
<Sync time="180.865"/>
is cockfighting ,
<Sync time="182.250"/>
where instead of having the sort of like open u- r-
<Sync time="186.020"/>
available uh and regulated cockfights ,
<Sync time="189.050"/>
bull- uh bullfighting would simply become something like what cockfighting is today ,
<Sync time="192.920"/>
where it is
<Sync time="193.520"/>
wildly unregulated and as such , the abuses internalized by animals are much more significant and much more extreme .
<Sync time="201.220"/>
given that then , we think there is significant harm intrinsic to making this sort of practice illegal
<Sync time="206.790"/>
and making it harder to conduct this in an open
<Sync time="209.660"/>
um
<Sync time="210.340"/>
in an open and public fashion
<Sync time="212.740"/>
where , you know , government officials can step in and say these practices are humane ,
<Sync time="216.870"/>
these practices are not humane .
<Sync time="218.660"/>
proud to oppose .
<Sync time="220.691"/>
