we should introduce goal-line technology .
<Sync time="3.440"/>
so we're going to argue
<Sync time="5.320"/>
that this technology
<Sync time="6.640"/>
which allows referees to use a computer to check
<Sync time="9.575"/>
whether a goal was actually scored
<Sync time="11.630"/>
should be used in high level football competitions , such as the premier league ,
<Sync time="16.110"/>
champions league , la liga ,
<Sync time="18.105"/>
and world cup .
<Sync time="19.870"/>
we think that whenever possible , these technologies should be implemented in a league , but we recognize that some smaller leagues might not have the ability to do so .
<Sync time="28.015"/>
we think that ultimately this would be beneficial for the leagues and for football as a whole .
<Sync time="33.370"/>
three arguments for our side .
<Sync time="35.420"/>
the first is that this should make football a more fair sport .
<Sync time="39.360"/>

<Sync time="39.875"/>
it's important that fans perceive that a sport is fair if you want them to watch .
<Sync time="44.945"/>
and realize that all of the money that football teams bring in
<Sync time="48.320"/>
is contingent on people watching the sport .
<Sync time="50.735"/>
they sell advertisements and spots on t_v and seats in stadia ,
<Sync time="55.010"/>
and these are how they make all of their money . so this is very important
<Sync time="58.240"/>
for the leagues and the teams within them , as businesses .
<Sync time="62.470"/>
goal-line technology makes the sport
<Sync time="64.500"/>
more fair because now
<Sync time="65.985"/>
you're able to objectively measure whether a given goal
<Sync time="69.040"/>
was scored .
<Sync time="70.215"/>
right now we can have highly trained officials try to make a judgment call
<Sync time="74.255"/>
but at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="75.605"/>
it will never be as accurate as having a computer make that determination .
<Sync time="80.020"/>
we think that when fans understand that something completely objective is determining whether or not
<Sync time="85.440"/>
goals have been scored ,
<Sync time="86.705"/>
that
<Sync time="87.265"/>
there will be a better appearance of fairness within the league
<Sync time="90.600"/>
and that many people who don't watch football right now , because they think it's rigged or because they think that it's not fair ,
<Sync time="96.540"/>
would be more likely to support the sport and spend their money on it
<Sync time="100.260"/>
if we introduce this goal-line technology .
<Sync time="102.935"/>
in particular , at a time when more sports are becoming popular in traditional football areas , such as
<Sync time="108.550"/>
basketball gaining popularity in europe ,
<Sync time="111.040"/>
we think it's important for leagues and for teams
<Sync time="113.655"/>
to improve their reputation
<Sync time="115.470"/>
and improve their standing in the community .
<Sync time="119.010"/>
our second argument is about accountability for officials .
<Sync time="122.760"/>

<Sync time="123.480"/>
while match fixing is relatively rare in both football and any professional highly organized sport ,
<Sync time="129.890"/>
we think that it's important that we take every step possible to limit match fixing .
<Sync time="134.495"/>
the reason why is that all of the harms listed above to having
<Sync time="138.180"/>
a worse reputation , such as fewer viewers and less advertising money ,
<Sync time="143.170"/>
are
<Sync time="143.730"/>
greatly multiplied by the perception that the officiating is unfair .
<Sync time="149.030"/>
right now , if there's a perception that
<Sync time="151.005"/>
popular players or popular teams are given more credit by the officials , then that feeds into all the harms we told you about earlier .
<Sync time="158.500"/>
where goal-line technology makes football a better sport
<Sync time="161.420"/>
is that it introduces
<Sync time="162.810"/>
independent accountability
<Sync time="164.670"/>
for officials .
<Sync time="166.145"/>
someone from the league or someone from fifa or another body can go in and see if the referee
<Sync time="172.235"/>
was actually making a legitimate call .
<Sync time="174.415"/>
this makes max- match fixing
<Sync time="176.480"/>
basically impossible , because referees can't lie
<Sync time="179.140"/>
about who scored what goal .
<Sync time="181.350"/>
so all of the benefits above come through
<Sync time="183.540"/>
uniquely from goal-line technology .
<Sync time="186.275"/>

<Sync time="187.490"/>
our third and final point is about having football conform to international sporting norms .
<Sync time="193.100"/>
while it's true that football is the most popular sport in the world ,
<Sync time="196.210"/>
it's not growing as quickly as some other sports .
<Sync time="198.760"/>
basketball , in particular , is rapidly becoming more and more popular
<Sync time="202.580"/>
worldwide .
<Sync time="204.100"/>
we think that it's important that football conform to the expectations people have for sport more broadly
<Sync time="209.230"/>
if it's going to grow in areas where it hasn't been as popular in the past ,
<Sync time="213.050"/>
such as the united states ,
<Sync time="214.610"/>
and maintain its status as the most popular sport
<Sync time="217.610"/>
in countries where it's very popular right now .
<Sync time="220.690"/>
if you're a new sports fan in america or china and you're deciding whether you want to spend more money on football
<Sync time="226.590"/>
or basketball ,
<Sync time="227.760"/>
one thing you might ask yourself is which one is more fair ,
<Sync time="231.130"/>
so or which one seems more legitimate to you .
<Sync time="233.870"/>
and because other sports , like basketball ,
<Sync time="236.040"/>
like baseball ,
<Sync time="236.900"/>
use technology comparable
<Sync time="238.610"/>
to goal-line technology ,
<Sync time="240.090"/>
it's important that football do this as well
<Sync time="242.700"/>
so that they're able to keep fans and to attract new fans .
<Sync time="246.010"/>
so for all of these reasons , we should introduce goal-line technology .
<Sync time="249.400"/>
thank you .
