we actually agree with the previous speaker that eighteen-year-olds are perfectly able to drink responsibly ,
<Sync time="7.440"/>
but he himself does a fantastic job of explaining how
<Sync time="11.480"/>
the legal age limit
<Sync time="13.030"/>
is not really the de facto age in which you start drinking .
<Sync time="16.910"/>
we are well aware that eighteen and nineteen and twenty-year-olds drink alcohol
<Sync time="21.420"/>
left and right , and we're fine with that .
<Sync time="24.050"/>
but the problem in lowering the drinking age , the legal drinking age , to eighteen or to sixteen
<Sync time="29.990"/>
is that it subsequently will lead to the lowering of the de facto age that
<Sync time="34.995"/>
k- kids start drinking
<Sync time="36.660"/>
to like fourteen or fifteen ,
<Sync time="38.560"/>
and that's already something that
<Sync time="40.885"/>
side government would also agree
<Sync time="42.770"/>
that is un
<Sync time="44.465"/>
like
<Sync time="45.200"/>
preferable .
<Sync time="46.340"/>
so here's what we say , basically :
<Sync time="48.950"/>
the legal definition of
<Sync time="51.645"/>
who is a minor and who is an adult
<Sync time="54.100"/>
will forever be random .
<Sync time="56.730"/>
whether we set it at twenty one or eighteen or sixteen ,
<Sync time="60.115"/>
it is clear and obvious that it won't really apply equally to everyone . of course , there are sixteen-year-olds that are very mature and calculated and trustworthy ,
<Sync time="69.465"/>
and there are twenty-two and twenty-three-year-olds that are very immature and reckless .
<Sync time="74.080"/>
therefore , it doesn't matter where we draw the line ,
<Sync time="76.830"/>
it is going to be , at the same time , overinclusive and underinclusive ,
<Sync time="81.245"/>
but we still have to draw the line somewhere .
<Sync time="84.220"/>
so ,
<Sync time="84.985"/>
we're willing to accept
<Sync time="86.815"/>
the position of side government
<Sync time="89.190"/>
that most eighteen-year-olds are responsible and mature enough
<Sync time="93.165"/>
in order for us to be
<Sync time="94.685"/>
fine with having them drink ,
<Sync time="96.605"/>
but we th- but we think that they will also concede
<Sync time="99.545"/>
that most fourteen-year-olds are absolutely not responsible enough .
<Sync time="104.080"/>
what we
<Sync time="104.960"/>
also must take into consideration , when we draw the line ,
<Sync time="108.330"/>
are the effects that daniel explains so so like so nicely
<Sync time="113.050"/>
of how , you know ,
<Sync time="114.185"/>
the taboo when something is forbidden makes me want it more and so on .
<Sync time="118.700"/>
so ,
<Sync time="119.295"/>
this means we need to acknowledge the fact that no matter where
<Sync time="123.240"/>
we draw the line ,
<Sync time="124.830"/>
this means that like in the vicinity of that
<Sync time="127.760"/>
limit , people will not abide by it .
<Sync time="130.440"/>
for this reason , we had a very good reason to take this extra buffer zone
<Sync time="135.270"/>
and to set the dr-
<Sync time="136.355"/>
legal drinking age to twenty-one .
<Sync time="138.840"/>
this comes out of the understanding that most
<Sync time="141.810"/>
eighteen and nineteen-year-olds will still be drinking and that's fine ,
<Sync time="145.485"/>
but far less fourteen-year-olds will be s-
<Sync time="147.750"/>
will be drinking because it will seem so much remote
<Sync time="150.995"/>
to them .
<Sync time="151.910"/>
note that all of the harms that the previous speaker
<Sync time="154.270"/>
lists in regard to like reckless
<Sync time="156.780"/>
responses e- like
<Sync time="157.800"/>
irresponsible drinking
<Sync time="159.195"/>
that results from not being of the legal age
<Sync time="162.110"/>
will simply apply tomorrow to fourteen-year-olds , and that's much worse .
<Sync time="167.190"/>
so ,
<Sync time="167.955"/>
we see the same type of logic in other places in the law , by the way . for example , when setting speed limits to
<Sync time="175.035"/>
like roads and highways ,
<Sync time="176.680"/>
it's perfectly obvious to the government
<Sync time="179.220"/>
that most people will exceed the
<Sync time="181.965"/>
like
<Sync time="182.620"/>
l- the limit and the speed
<Sync time="184.185"/>
that that's allowed in a f-
<Sync time="185.660"/>
in like a few percent .
<Sync time="187.360"/>
but
<Sync time="187.995"/>
in most cases , like the police will even turn a blind eye to mild violations .
<Sync time="192.970"/>
yet ,
<Sync time="193.660"/>
these limitations are
<Sync time="195.400"/>
set in a manner that is relatively conservative ,
<Sync time="198.830"/>
i-
<Sync time="199.125"/>
like just in order to make sure
<Sync time="201.895"/>
that whoever violates them still doesn't drive too fast . we call this
<Sync time="206.015"/>
the anchoring effect .
<Sync time="208.010"/>
this the number that we set is being used as a sort of a metaphorical anchor that people don't stray too far from .
<Sync time="214.235"/>
so ,
<Sync time="215.165"/>
we say that
<Sync time="216.450"/>
uh it's it's perfectly
<Sync time="218.500"/>
um
<Sync time="219.320"/>
like reasonable what the other side are saying , that the
<Sync time="221.830"/>
current drinking age is a bit unfair to eighteen-year-olds
<Sync time="224.740"/>
but as they tell us themselves ,
<Sync time="227.535"/>
ch-
<Sync time="228.550"/>
like eighteen-year-olds don't really suffer too much out of this . they drink anyway . so if we lower the drinking age ,
<Sync time="234.800"/>
we say that the damages are going to be
<Sync time="237.395"/>
much more significant .
<Sync time="239.290"/>
so ,
<Sync time="239.730"/>
oppose the motion .
<Sync time="241.509"/>
