we should lower the drinking age .
<Sync time="2.350"/>
we should lower it
<Sync time="3.350"/>
everywhere and we should probably lower it to
<Sync time="6.140"/>
uh sixteen ,
<Sync time="7.280"/>
maybe eighteen ,
<Sync time="8.420"/>
definitely below twenty one ,
<Sync time="10.260"/>
and the reason that we should do this
<Sync time="12.260"/>
is twofold :
<Sync time="13.445"/>
first and foremost , on a practicality level , as far as sensible regulation of act of drinking ,
<Sync time="19.395"/>
and secondarily
<Sync time="20.910"/>
as far as rights are concerned .
<Sync time="23.420"/>
so let's start by talking about responsible usage .
<Sync time="26.460"/>
i think the first and most important thing to note is that
<Sync time="29.390"/>
the drinking age is the biggest joke in the entire world and as somebody who is now just
<Sync time="34.760"/>
who is now twenty one
<Sync time="36.320"/>
but has nevertheless been drinking for
<Sync time="38.700"/>
many years now ,
<Sync time="40.105"/>
i think that if you ask just about any person in 
<Sync time="43.265"/>
most countries , certainly in america ,
<Sync time="45.810"/>
they tell you that there's a variety of ways in which an underage person can get alcohol and that the drinking age is entirely
<Sync time="51.350"/>
unenforced .
<Sync time="52.450"/>
you can get it from an older friend ,
<Sync time="54.300"/>
you can get it from a lot of parents who don't care because when they were in high school
<Sync time="58.120"/>
the drinking age was eighteen , you can get it from
<Sync time="61.070"/>
with a fake i_d .
<Sync time="62.450"/>
years a whole , there's like an endless {flu/flow} of
<Sync time="64.900"/>
ways in which
<Sync time="65.940"/>
alcohol is just accessible to people .
<Sync time="67.790"/>
so ,
<Sync time="68.830"/>
given that we operate in a world in which alcohol is going to be accessible to minors and that this isn't going to change because of deeply ingrained
<Sync time="76.700"/>
social structures that make alcohol a part of our culture ,
<Sync time="80.140"/>
the focus shouldn't be
<Sync time="81.510"/>
can we get people underage to stop drinking ,
<Sync time="84.140"/>
the focus should be
<Sync time="85.175"/>
how can we make sure that people who are underage
<Sync time="87.520"/>
drink responsibly .
<Sync time="89.030"/>
so i think that the first thing that you want to do
<Sync time="91.655"/>
is not make people be afraid to call the police or be afraid to call a- an emergency or like the e_m_t's
<Sync time="98.340"/>
if somebody for example
<Sync time="99.930"/>
drinks too much ,
<Sync time="101.080"/>
or if somebody is um possibly um getting like sick from drinking too much .
<Sync time="106.080"/>
and i think that this is a real problem in a lot of like um parties and things like that
<Sync time="110.100"/>
where
<Sync time="110.905"/>
because there's a real fear of consequences , there's a real fear of getting in trouble ,
<Sync time="115.510"/>
people don't wanna tell the authorities when things got out of hand .
<Sync time="118.630"/>
so you're less likely , first and foremost , to see partying happen in a responsible way and you're less likely see drinking happen in a responsible way
<Sync time="125.670"/>
secondarily , when you're not allowed to drink legally 
<Sync time="128.340"/>
you're more likely going to do this in less safe places .
<Sync time="131.220"/>
the drinking is more likely going to happen in the basement of a fraternity
<Sync time="134.665"/>
or the basement of like or like or in a high school party ,
<Sync time="137.830"/>
than at a bar or somewhere where it's like public and a lot more
<Sync time="141.370"/>
um able to be regulated .
<Sync time="143.025"/>
so i think that that's another thing that's incredibly important .
<Sync time="145.785"/>
but i think it additionally when you have a drinking age ,
<Sync time="149.000"/>
it creates more of an an allure or more of a taboo or more of a glorification around drinking
<Sync time="154.670"/>
that makes us that people are more likely to over do it ,
<Sync time="158.310"/>
so that people are more likely to use it as an act of rebellion and that people are more likely to
<Sync time="163.210"/>
essentially drink as like a symbol of independence . a sink- a symbol of having fun in your youth .
<Sync time="168.695"/>
and i think this is very clearly something that we see right now
<Sync time="171.745"/>
and it's a big reason why um like for example 
<Sync time="175.265"/>
%hes
<Sync time="176.100"/>
risks of binge drinking
<Sync time="177.890"/>
or over uh
<Sync time="179.155"/>
%hes
<Sync time="181.260"/>

<Sync time="181.775"/>
using too much alcohol are much more prevalent and places in america than they are in more some european countries
<Sync time="188.110"/>
where
<Sync time="188.860"/>
it's much more normalized and there's not the same kind of allure .
<Sync time="192.575"/>
but
<Sync time="193.360"/>
the final thing that i wanna talk about is right . because i think that
<Sync time="197.005"/>
the idea that
<Sync time="198.625"/>
if your eighteen , or even if you're younger , you're an
<Sync time="201.990"/>
independent person
<Sync time="203.240"/>
with autonomy ,
<Sync time="204.260"/>
with agency , with dignity and worth ,
<Sync time="206.800"/>
who can make decisions about their life .
<Sync time="208.980"/>
who can decide whether or not it's good or bad for them to have a shot of alcohol ,
<Sync time="213.480"/>
who can decide whether or not it's good for bad for them to have a glass of wine at night . i think this is an incredibly
<Sync time="218.830"/>
basic decision
<Sync time="220.405"/>
that the average pers- the average teenager is entirely capable of making .
<Sync time="224.795"/>
it's not like you're buying a car or something like that , where you're spending tens of thousands of dollars ,
<Sync time="229.940"/>
or in something that's going to affect you for years on end .
<Sync time="232.890"/>
we're talking about things that are only going to affect you for one night ,
<Sync time="236.160"/>
that aren't ultimately that big of a deal
<Sync time="238.330"/>
and are perfectly reasonable decisions for people to make .
<Sync time="241.160"/>
we let people buy like sandwiches . i don't see why alcohol is all that much
<Sync time="245.320"/>
%hes why it's all that different .
<Sync time="246.920"/>
just because something affects your brain
<Sync time="249.040"/>
does not mean that you shouldn't be able to like um use it
<Sync time="252.500"/>
as long as you can use it responsibly .
<Sync time="254.325"/>
and the assumption that young people cannot do something responsibly
<Sync time="258.240"/>
is obscenely ageist to the many responsible young people ,
<Sync time="261.670"/>
and to the many people who simply do not fit into these stereotypes .
<Sync time="265.120"/>
so for all those reasons we should lower the drinking age .
<Sync time="267.710"/>
