i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt libertarianism .
<Sync time="4.820"/>
three independent points , but first a quick model .
<Sync time="8.230"/>
uh we would say that this is , you know , something we are adopting in terms of a governmental structure ,
<Sync time="12.940"/>
so specifically a governmental structure that uh
<Sync time="15.830"/>
necessitates
<Sync time="16.910"/>
less involvement of the state
<Sync time="18.890"/>
into personal affairs . this means , you know , everything from
<Sync time="21.860"/>
lower taxes and
<Sync time="23.125"/>
less regulations
<Sync time="24.670"/>
all the way down to , you know , less involvement in shaping social policy ,
<Sync time="28.200"/>
like what constitutes marriage .
<Sync time="30.110"/>
um we'd endure , say , wide array of policies
<Sync time="32.630"/>
underneath this framework , but broadly we're going to defend the notion that
<Sync time="36.130"/>
uh government should just do
<Sync time="38.120"/>
less
<Sync time="38.610"/>
essentially , and a private citizen should be
<Sync time="40.680"/>
making more decisions about what happens to them
<Sync time="43.270"/>
rather than the government making those decisions for them .
<Sync time="46.580"/>
the first independent point that i really just broadly want to establish is
<Sync time="49.970"/>
why these principles matter , that um
<Sync time="52.670"/>
autonomy ,
<Sync time="53.620"/>
on an individual level , is something that's really , really important .
<Sync time="57.035"/>
so ,
<Sync time="57.755"/>
the majority of our constructs of what constitute our rights
<Sync time="61.370"/>
is derived from autonomy being the principal thing that we care about .
<Sync time="65.600"/>
even something as fundamental as our right to life is
<Sync time="68.080"/>
only based on the fact that we , you know , have a life where we can make decisions about what happens to us and ,
<Sync time="73.490"/>
you know , what freedoms we have . that
<Sync time="75.770"/>
autonomy and that liberty
<Sync time="77.290"/>
is really fundamental to our entire perception of what constitutes a right .
<Sync time="82.110"/>
so this is something that we should always take with , you know ,
<Sync time="85.070"/>
to the the highest extreme essentially , that we always want to establish as much autonomy for the individual as is reasonably possible .
<Sync time="92.110"/>
there will always be constraints on that , for example , we
<Sync time="94.700"/>
shouldn't give them autonomy to murder .
<Sync time="96.440"/>
but even then , we would only say that the ,
<Sync time="98.360"/>
you know , the reason that you don't want people to be allowed to murder
<Sync time="101.620"/>
is so b- because doing so actually restricts other people's autonomy .
<Sync time="106.630"/>
in another sense , w-
<Sync time="108.320"/>
essential- what we really want to do is maximize autonomy , on net , for as many people as possible .
<Sync time="114.450"/>
i think that ,
<Sync time="115.110"/>
broadly speaking , libertarianism
<Sync time="116.820"/>
accomplishes that by ensuring that the government has as little a m-
<Sync time="120.265"/>
uh role in people's lives as is possible .
<Sync time="123.570"/>
the second point that i want to bring up , though ,
<Sync time="125.585"/>
is that
<Sync time="126.290"/>
the government is a bad proxy for making these decisions for people .
<Sync time="130.300"/>
so i think a lot of the defense
<Sync time="131.820"/>
um that will come out of side opposition in favor of big government will be that , you know ,
<Sync time="136.020"/>
regulations , like food safety regulations and things like that ,
<Sync time="139.450"/>
are effective at ensuring that people um
<Sync time="142.150"/>
are protected from predatory practices and things like that
<Sync time="145.130"/>
that
<Sync time="145.430"/>
limit their autonomy by establishing harms upon them .
<Sync time="149.230"/>
the problem is that individuals are really the best actors for these things . they know best .
<Sync time="153.690"/>
um
<Sync time="154.330"/>
and when you try to proxy their preferences through bureaucracy , essentially ,
<Sync time="158.800"/>
there's always going to be inefficiencies intrinsic to that , that
<Sync time="161.820"/>
the bureaucracy just
<Sync time="162.910"/>
isn't good at figuring out what that individual person wants
<Sync time="166.700"/>
and isn't in a position to make those decisions intelligently for them .
<Sync time="171.240"/>
so this ranges from everything to , you know , regulations being bad , something like , you know ,
<Sync time="175.650"/>
um a regulation on a
<Sync time="177.040"/>
auto producer not being able to put a certain feature in a car or
<Sync time="180.780"/>
having to wear seat belts ,
<Sync time="182.070"/>
when in reality that's just something that an individual person can decide if they want to buy something with seat belts or not based on their personal preferences .
<Sync time="190.680"/>
but also social policy , where the government intervenes into things like uh gay marriage or trans rights ,
<Sync time="196.035"/>
simply on the basis of the the social mores of the society around them ,
<Sync time="199.970"/>
but uh th-
<Sync time="201.120"/>
in reality , this isn't something that society should be deciding .
<Sync time="204.100"/>
this is something that the individual should be deciding insofar as it
<Sync time="206.965"/>
most directly affects them .
<Sync time="208.700"/>
so we would say that when these regulations come down from the upper level at the government ,
<Sync time="212.740"/>
that's necessarily problematic .
<Sync time="215.090"/>
the third and final point i want to make very briefly is just that
<Sync time="217.835"/>
people really , at a principled level , should be responsible for themselves .
<Sync time="221.720"/>
i don't think that there's a positive obligation for an individual to support another
<Sync time="225.665"/>
through redistributive economics , for example .
<Sync time="228.430"/>
um and the reason for this is that , you know , we derive our , you know , our humanity and our um
<Sync time="233.840"/>
and our sense of worth
<Sync time="235.110"/>
from the autonomy um over our property or things , and
<Sync time="238.420"/>
because those those that property is facilitative to us being able to , you know ,
<Sync time="243.320"/>
exert our own preferences , i
<Sync time="245.095"/>
if i want a car , if i want to drive around a lot because that makes me happy , i need the ,
<Sync time="248.795"/>
you know , the money to buy a car .
<Sync time="250.625"/>
and i think
<Sync time="251.445"/>
if we do the work to get that money and if we earn that capital ,
<Sync time="256.060"/>
that property has to belong to us . it's unjust then when the government takes it away . proud to propose .
<Sync time="261.780"/>
