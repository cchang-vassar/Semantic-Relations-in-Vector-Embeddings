we should not adopt multiculturalism .
<Sync time="3.250"/>
so i want to be very clear what this debate is about .
<Sync time="6.660"/>
when we say don't adopt multiculturalism ,
<Sync time="9.350"/>
we mean that people should assimilate into society
<Sync time="12.900"/>
rather than integrate .
<Sync time="14.375"/>
so here's the difference :
<Sync time="16.040"/>
when people assimilate ,
<Sync time="17.630"/>
they give up
<Sync time="18.400"/>
many aspects of their
<Sync time="20.620"/>
pre-immigration culture
<Sync time="22.185"/>
in order to take on aspects of the dominant culture in their new country .
<Sync time="26.055"/>

<Sync time="26.660"/>
a good example of this would be people moving from eastern europe to the united states
<Sync time="31.055"/>
in the early twentieth century .
<Sync time="33.300"/>
if you came from the russian empire
<Sync time="35.470"/>
to america in nineteen hundred ,
<Sync time="37.430"/>
you most likely gave up your original language ,
<Sync time="40.130"/>
your religion was probably normalized to
<Sync time="42.310"/>
certain american customs ,
<Sync time="43.915"/>
we see that many orthodox churches in america
<Sync time="46.520"/>
are very different than orthodox churches in the former soviet union ,
<Sync time="49.760"/>
for instance .
<Sync time="50.850"/>
and it's quite likely that you adopted many parts of the american national identity ,
<Sync time="55.420"/>
things like baseball
<Sync time="56.745"/>
and other american ideas in place of your traditional games and views .
<Sync time="61.330"/>
so we think that that's preferable to a world like the one will describes in which people keep their religion
<Sync time="66.385"/>
and keep their customs .
<Sync time="68.200"/>
will says that he wants to avoid problems like ghettoization ,
<Sync time="71.210"/>
but we think that even if you have
<Sync time="72.910"/>
russian or italian or irish neighborhoods in american cities ,
<Sync time="76.680"/>
at the end of the day after , one or two generations , everyone is so americanized
<Sync time="80.910"/>
that it's really just a legacy thing and not something that affects people day to day .
<Sync time="85.870"/>
so with that in mind , we have two big arguments .
<Sync time="88.125"/>
the first is about national unity .
<Sync time="91.050"/>
we think that one reason why the united states was able to mobilize
<Sync time="94.725"/>
millions of people of different backgrounds for the two world wars
<Sync time="98.230"/>
was because of its policy of assimilation
<Sync time="101.300"/>
rather than integration .
<Sync time="102.915"/>
in other words , the united states didn't adopt very much from
<Sync time="106.635"/>
russian culture
<Sync time="107.740"/>
when russians were coming over here in the early twentieth century
<Sync time="110.710"/>
in large numbers . instead , we encouraged immigrants to adopt
<Sync time="114.030"/>
elements of american culture .
<Sync time="115.795"/>
but the result is that our country was stronger in times of war because we were able to know that everyone
<Sync time="121.035"/>
shared certain core beliefs and core values
<Sync time="123.635"/>
as an american and that there were certain
<Sync time="125.740"/>
commonalities across different groups within america because people
<Sync time="129.890"/>
had assimilated so much to american culture .
<Sync time="132.960"/>
so you could have
<Sync time="133.890"/>
army units where you had , you know ,
<Sync time="135.890"/>
african american , russian american , irish american soldiers with an anglo-american officer
<Sync time="140.915"/>
or
<Sync time="141.415"/>
shift around any combination of those ,
<Sync time="143.595"/>
and it wouldn't be a problem because everyone ultimately was an american
<Sync time="147.100"/>
rather than a member of the groups that they were part of
<Sync time="149.630"/>
before they came to this country .
<Sync time="151.570"/>
we think that ultimately this may increase the strength of the nation in times of war ,
<Sync time="155.190"/>
and therefore it is desirable .
<Sync time="157.415"/>

<Sync time="158.180"/>
but our second argument is that we think , in the long term , we get better treatment for minorities ,
<Sync time="163.535"/>
and i'd like to compare a couple of different
<Sync time="166.105"/>
examples from around the world .
<Sync time="168.350"/>
when people move from
<Sync time="170.650"/>
muslim countries to the united states today ,
<Sync time="173.580"/>
maybe they keep their religion ,
<Sync time="175.150"/>
but ultimately they
<Sync time="176.830"/>
speak english as their primary day-to-day language most often , they send their children to
<Sync time="181.390"/>
secular american schools ,
<Sync time="183.430"/>
oftentimes their daughters don't cover their heads , they adopt more american customs in terms of dress ,
<Sync time="188.485"/>
and people basically americanize to a very high degree .
<Sync time="192.470"/>
compare this to a country like france , where what you have instead is people who
<Sync time="196.485"/>
move to france from countries like algeria ,
<Sync time="199.250"/>
um and i'm not putting blame on these people , oftentimes it's for colonial reasons that they're moving their
<Sync time="204.625"/>
uh that are outside of their control , but they move to these countries and
<Sync time="207.995"/>
they maintain their original language in their communities .
<Sync time="211.420"/>
they often don't integrate into the french way of life ,
<Sync time="214.045"/>
and sometimes that's because the country doesn't allow them to do so .
<Sync time="217.140"/>
will touched on this when he talked about nation states .
<Sync time="219.990"/>
but we think that it would be preferable to have people
<Sync time="222.405"/>
assimilate in a more american fashion ,
<Sync time="224.800"/>
rather than try and fail to integrate ,
<Sync time="227.130"/>
because what will talks about , things like celebrating diversity ,
<Sync time="230.450"/>
ultimately looks an awful lot like people remaining different .
<Sync time="233.350"/>
we think that in the long term becoming more like the same is likely to get you better treatment
<Sync time="238.005"/>
than remaining different and that if you see how
<Sync time="240.690"/>
groups like italians and jews are treated much better now in america than they were a hundred years ago ,
<Sync time="245.635"/>
i think you have a clear road map for how this can happen .
<Sync time="248.700"/>
so for all these reasons , we should not adopt multiculturalism .
<Sync time="252.290"/>
thank you .
