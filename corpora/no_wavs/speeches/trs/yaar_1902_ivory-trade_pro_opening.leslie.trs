we should legalize
<Sync time="1.535"/>
ivory trade .
<Sync time="3.050"/>
so on the one side of the scales in this debate , we have the possible extinction of endangered elephants in africa
<Sync time="10.620"/>
and on the other , we have massive financial benefits to some of the poorest countries in the world .
<Sync time="16.580"/>
in this speech , we're going to argue the following :
<Sync time="19.410"/>
a ,
<Sync time="20.520"/>
the latter is simply more important
<Sync time="22.880"/>
than the former ,
<Sync time="23.925"/>

<Sync time="24.650"/>
and b : even if not ,
<Sync time="26.985"/>
banning ivory trade does very little to help protect the elephants ,
<Sync time="32.000"/>
even the opposite
<Sync time="33.470"/>
and so we might as well , at the very least , try and make the most out of it
<Sync time="37.740"/>
and guarantee
<Sync time="38.865"/>
that the money
<Sync time="39.865"/>
is reaching the right place .
<Sync time="42.430"/>
first argument :
<Sync time="44.105"/>
so we were all taught how important it is
<Sync time="46.860"/>
to protect endangered species ,
<Sync time="49.420"/>
but
<Sync time="49.850"/>
we would actually challenge this notion and dare ask , why is it so important ?
<Sync time="54.710"/>
what's the intrinsic value of african elephants being able to walk around safely ?
<Sync time="60.360"/>
surely , it can't be about animal rights
<Sync time="62.920"/>
since we generally don't mind slaughtering billions of animals each passing day ,
<Sync time="68.130"/>
just so we can enjoy eating meat or dairy or wearing fur or leather .
<Sync time="72.640"/>
what's so different about wanting to enjoy the use of ivory ?
<Sync time="76.040"/>
so , we think that
<Sync time="77.810"/>
apart from vague sentimental values , there's just not a lot to say for the importance
<Sync time="84.565"/>
of protecting africa's elephants .
<Sync time="87.250"/>
on the other hand , however ,
<Sync time="89.205"/>
the
<Sync time="89.860"/>
potential benefit that can come out
<Sync time="92.385"/>
of ivory trade is huge .
<Sync time="94.540"/>
the main countries that stand to gain a lot from this are countries like zimbabwe or botswana
<Sync time="100.140"/>
and the like .
<Sync time="101.360"/>

<Sync time="101.990"/>
these are incredibly poor countries that can't possibly create a competitive advantage for themselves
<Sync time="107.355"/>
in the industry or
<Sync time="108.980"/>
agriculture sectors because
<Sync time="110.915"/>
this would require
<Sync time="112.345"/>
knowledge and technology that they simply don't possess .
<Sync time="115.725"/>
so , the one thing that these countries are uniquely rich in
<Sync time="119.970"/>
is wildlife .
<Sync time="121.130"/>
and so , relying on hunting is one of the only opportunities for them to generate growth .
<Sync time="127.340"/>
this is being heavily hindered today by the ban on ivory .
<Sync time="131.350"/>
this is a ban
<Sync time="132.495"/>
that
<Sync time="133.085"/>
other powerful countries have decided upon without considering for a moment
<Sync time="138.070"/>
the weak
<Sync time="138.570"/>
countries that are going to be most affected .
<Sync time="141.500"/>
we think that the people of africa
<Sync time="143.365"/>
are more important than its elephants ,
<Sync time="145.690"/>
and our obligation should rest with them
<Sync time="148.320"/>
first and foremost .
<Sync time="150.020"/>
at the point at which we need to prioritize the lives of one over the other , we think that the choice should be easy .
<Sync time="156.925"/>

<Sync time="157.505"/>
but let's move on and say
<Sync time="159.525"/>
that you remained unconvinced
<Sync time="161.540"/>
and that you still believe that it's wrong to allow elephants to go extinct .
<Sync time="166.380"/>
we have some bad news .
<Sync time="168.410"/>
the ban on the ivory trade does very little to help
<Sync time="172.195"/>
on that regard .
<Sync time="173.520"/>
ivory is still a very desired commodity
<Sync time="176.445"/>
and the demand for it
<Sync time="178.100"/>
remains high .
<Sync time="179.230"/>
thus , like any other thing that's being banned ,
<Sync time="182.085"/>
a black market is created .
<Sync time="184.495"/>
all this ban does is make sure that instead of the countries themselves enjoying the benefits of ivory trade ,
<Sync time="190.720"/>
all of the money goes into the pockets of
<Sync time="192.860"/>
illegal poachers .
<Sync time="195.480"/>
um
<Sync time="196.155"/>
with the current ban on the ivory trade ,
<Sync time="198.590"/>
the countries have
<Sync time="199.885"/>
l- very little incentive to invest the efforts needed to stop these butchers because why should they care about the elephants' population if it's no longer a source of income ?
<Sync time="209.660"/>
note :
<Sync time="210.315"/>
these
<Sync time="210.920"/>
poachers
<Sync time="211.870"/>
are even more likely to bring about the speedy extinction of the elephant population .
<Sync time="216.890"/>
why ? because
<Sync time="219.310"/>
if we allow ivory trade ,
<Sync time="222.130"/>
governments will want to make sure that the elephant population isn't eradicated entirely , because they want to continue making money
<Sync time="228.800"/>
off it .
<Sync time="229.840"/>
so ,
<Sync time="230.455"/>
they make sure they control the hunting .
<Sync time="232.910"/>
poachers aren't looking at the bigger picture . their incentive is s-
<Sync time="236.485"/>
to hunt down as many as possible right now before someone else gets to .
<Sync time="240.570"/>
this is the well-known economic problem that's called the " tragedy of the commons " .
<Sync time="245.640"/>
this means that
<Sync time="246.585"/>
it's likely that lifting the ban will lead to the elephant population being extinct way quicker
<Sync time="252.040"/>
and even if not , at the very least , it
<Sync time="254.360"/>
won't do much to help them .
<Sync time="256.440"/>
and so at the very least , we think
<Sync time="258.680"/>
that we have to look
<Sync time="260.015"/>
at where is the money being made ,
<Sync time="262.490"/>
f- like where is the money being made from hunting
<Sync time="265.950"/>
uh
<Sync time="266.780"/>
put to
<Sync time="267.710"/>
better use , and that is if it reaches the countries and not the poachers .
<Sync time="271.915"/>
so for all these reasons , proud to propose .
<Sync time="275.412"/>
