i stand
<Sync time="1.805"/>
in firm opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.950"/>
we should support same-sex marriage .
<Sync time="6.905"/>
as a brief overview , i want to say
<Sync time="9.670"/>
that
<Sync time="10.485"/>
when we say marriage , we don't mean the collection of tax benefits and other recognition
<Sync time="16.175"/>
that individuals get from the government and institutions .
<Sync time="19.470"/>
we would say that same-sex couples should get the same sort of tax benefits
<Sync time="23.220"/>
as
<Sync time="23.860"/>
heterosexual couples .
<Sync time="25.725"/>
in the same way ,
<Sync time="26.855"/>
we would say that things like hospitals and
<Sync time="29.200"/>
insurance programs
<Sync time="30.490"/>
should provide the same benefits to same-sex couples as they do
<Sync time="34.015"/>
to heterosexual couples .
<Sync time="36.000"/>
however , we think that the label of marriage
<Sync time="38.270"/>
is reserved for particular couples
<Sync time="40.600"/>
and particular institutions ,
<Sync time="42.305"/>
that same-sex marriage
<Sync time="43.725"/>
is fundamentally an oxymoron
<Sync time="46.740"/>
with this in mind .
<Sync time="48.210"/>
three arguments to support this motion :
<Sync time="50.340"/>
first , marriage is inherently religious .
<Sync time="52.975"/>
marriage as an institution comes from a long history
<Sync time="56.730"/>
developed by religious institutions .
<Sync time="58.850"/>
it was fundamentally a way in which two individuals of the opposite sex could come together
<Sync time="64.225"/>
and be married
<Sync time="65.310"/>
before god .
<Sync time="66.270"/>
if you look at marriage vows , be- around the world , particularly historical marriage vows ,
<Sync time="71.000"/>
they were all about
<Sync time="72.570"/>
religious individuals
<Sync time="74.045"/>
coming together before god
<Sync time="75.855"/>
and making a union .
<Sync time="77.620"/>
at the point where these religions fundamentally oppose same-sex marriage , it is unclear why we should enforce the will of the government and enforce the will of these couples
<Sync time="86.040"/>
against their own religion .
<Sync time="87.780"/>
at the point where someone thinks that they are going to hell if they support a same-sex marriage ,
<Sync time="92.630"/>
we think that the utility gained
<Sync time="94.585"/>
by having a label upon your union
<Sync time="96.750"/>
versus the disutility which comes from fundamentally violating your religion and
<Sync time="100.390"/>
violating your community
<Sync time="101.975"/>
and ignoring the systems of belief that you grew up with ,
<Sync time="105.290"/>
we think it is clear that individuals should be able to refuse to provide same-sex marriages .
<Sync time="109.860"/>
in the same way , we would say the government can continue to
<Sync time="113.315"/>
ban same-sex marriages
<Sync time="114.970"/>
insofar as marriage , once again , is an inherently religious institution .
<Sync time="119.360"/>
if there is
<Sync time="121.055"/>
a particular community which want to support same-sex marriage ,
<Sync time="125.300"/>
they're going against the teachings of historical religion ,
<Sync time="128.660"/>
and as such are not
<Sync time="129.830"/>
being true members of that religion .
<Sync time="132.300"/>
so we would say that same-sex marriage
<Sync time="134.220"/>
still would not be religiously permissible .
<Sync time="137.270"/>
my second argument
<Sync time="138.450"/>
is that marriage is also inherently oppressive .
<Sync time="141.370"/>
it is a patriarchal system which put women below men
<Sync time="145.140"/>
and
<Sync time="146.050"/>
forced individuals into
<Sync time="148.250"/>
situations that they did
<Sync time="149.690"/>
probably didn't want to be in .
<Sync time="151.010"/>
it took away the autonomy of both partners from splitting from the union
<Sync time="155.450"/>
and really
<Sync time="156.230"/>
abandoning their partner
<Sync time="159.060"/>
when they feel like it would be the most utile .
<Sync time="161.500"/>
as such , we would say that marriage is inherently bad .
<Sync time="164.500"/>
it promotes problematic norms within society
<Sync time="167.060"/>
and
<Sync time="167.510"/>
propagating it by supporting same-sex marriage
<Sync time="170.460"/>
simply expands these problematic norms
<Sync time="172.920"/>
even further .
<Sync time="175.320"/>
anti-marriage activists
<Sync time="177.220"/>
also %unclear the anti-same-sex marriage activists
<Sync time="180.720"/>
insofar
<Sync time="182.235"/>
as
<Sync time="183.380"/>

<Sync time="184.060"/>
whenever you support marriage , you're supporting a problematic institution
<Sync time="187.425"/>
which continues to oppress women around the world
<Sync time="190.330"/>
and
<Sync time="190.980"/>
largely leads to power imbalances within relationships which we think are inherently problematic .
<Sync time="196.295"/>

<Sync time="197.010"/>
our third and final argument is that this is a waste of resources among activists .
<Sync time="201.250"/>
supporting same-sex marriage on a government level
<Sync time="204.010"/>
will lead to a huge number of people
<Sync time="205.615"/>
leaving the l_g_b_t_q
<Sync time="208.450"/>
movement and activist forces .
<Sync time="210.680"/>
when schools were desegregated in the south ,
<Sync time="213.870"/>
the civil rights movement
<Sync time="214.980"/>
lo- lost a huge number of white allies
<Sync time="217.640"/>
simply because they thought the fight was done . in the same vein ,
<Sync time="220.950"/>
supporting same-sex marriage and passing same-sex marriage laws
<Sync time="224.240"/>
means that a huge number of straight activists will leave the community
<Sync time="227.790"/>
and stop fighting for the goals of l_g_b_t_q_a people .
<Sync time="231.160"/>
as a result ,
<Sync time="232.430"/>
things like trans rights ,
<Sync time="233.730"/>
things like
<Sync time="234.505"/>
gay homelessness ,
<Sync time="235.745"/>
will continue , and these are far more problematic .
<Sync time="238.140"/>
i don't really care if two straight
<Sync time="240.580"/>
people , excuse me , not two straight people, two
<Sync time="243.080"/>
gay people can get married ,
<Sync time="244.710"/>
{particularl-/particularly} if they're wealthy people ,
<Sync time="246.200"/>
if queer teens are still on the street
<Sync time="248.370"/>
dying due to homelessness .
<Sync time="250.120"/>
as such , we think the harms i-
<Sync time="251.650"/>
as a result of losing activists is far greater than the benefits of simply labeling
<Sync time="255.945"/>
a particular union .
<Sync time="257.245"/>
as such ,
<Sync time="258.080"/>
we oppose same-sex marriage .
<Sync time="260.859"/>
