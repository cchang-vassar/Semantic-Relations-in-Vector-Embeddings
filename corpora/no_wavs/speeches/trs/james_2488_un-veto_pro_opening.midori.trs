we should abolish the united nations security council veto power .
<Sync time="5.580"/>
so right now
<Sync time="6.970"/>
five countries , who were very powerful at the end of world war two ,
<Sync time="10.500"/>
the u_s , russia , china , britain and france ,
<Sync time="13.750"/>
are able to veto any business of the security council .
<Sync time="17.940"/>
the rotating members of the council ,
<Sync time="19.760"/>
countries like india and germany ,
<Sync time="21.570"/>
do not have the ability to use this veto .
<Sync time="23.690"/>
so we're going to argue that the security council
<Sync time="26.035"/>
would be better off without veto power .
<Sync time="28.600"/>
three arguments :
<Sync time="29.660"/>
first ,
<Sync time="30.310"/>
we think that the members who have been granted this power
<Sync time="33.040"/>
are outdated .
<Sync time="34.430"/>
in particular ,
<Sync time="35.350"/>
britain and france are not the world powers that they were
<Sync time="38.745"/>
in nineteen forty five .
<Sync time="40.590"/>
britain no longer controls india , france no longer has a massive empire
<Sync time="44.545"/>
in africa and southeast asia .
<Sync time="46.690"/>
at this point ,
<Sync time="47.730"/>
britain and france are just two
<Sync time="49.510"/>
medium sized countries that aren't actually that important
<Sync time="52.570"/>
internationally . except as e_u members .
<Sync time="55.285"/>
we think that there are many other more deserving countries ,
<Sync time="58.090"/>
notably india and japan ,
<Sync time="59.870"/>
who are not represented 
<Sync time="61.110"/>
on the security council in this way .
<Sync time="63.670"/>
so right now
<Sync time="64.440"/>
two countries that really don't matter 
<Sync time="66.190"/>
to international relations , because they're part of nato so they're under the u_s umbrella ,
<Sync time="70.630"/>
have a disproportionate influence
<Sync time="72.700"/>
on international law
<Sync time="74.565"/>
and decision making .
<Sync time="75.980"/>
we think that this is unjust ,
<Sync time="77.700"/>
that those countries don't have the power to deserve this or the population to deserve this ,
<Sync time="82.320"/>
so they ought not be given this power .
<Sync time="84.595"/>

<Sync time="85.395"/>
so the other team might try to tell you that , oh we should just transfer the power to india 
<Sync time="89.770"/>
or japan .
<Sync time="91.240"/>
but that just passes the ball down the road .
<Sync time="93.320"/>
because what happens when in the future of those countries are no longer as significant ?
<Sync time="97.620"/>
what if russia
<Sync time="98.610"/>
suddenly , for instance , stops being a superpower ?
<Sync time="101.500"/>
we think that ultimately
<Sync time="102.715"/>
it's always going to be very difficult to change the security council
<Sync time="106.340"/>
uh vetoes to appropriately reflect
<Sync time="108.560"/>
new developments in international relations and that it would simply be better
<Sync time="112.815"/>
not to have the policy at all 
<Sync time="114.400"/>
rather than to try to reform it .
<Sync time="116.460"/>
secondly , we would argue , that the veto power is undemocratic .
<Sync time="120.535"/>
right now you could have a hundred and ninety five countries all vote in favor of something ,
<Sync time="125.535"/>
but if one of the big five countries decides that they don't want it to happen ,
<Sync time="129.530"/>
then the policy couldn't be implemented .
<Sync time="131.980"/>
we've seen this with many resolutions on palestine
<Sync time="134.820"/>
that have tried to force israel to
<Sync time="136.680"/>
recognize the palestinians' right to the west bank and things like that .
<Sync time="140.510"/>
the united states vetoes them and it doesn't matter if a hundred and fifty other countries voted in support .
<Sync time="146.540"/>
since part of the purpose of the u_n is to promote international cooperation ,
<Sync time="151.630"/>
it seems that it flies in the face of that goal to let one country dictate to every other country
<Sync time="156.920"/>
what u_n policy can or cannot be .
<Sync time="159.415"/>
even if that country is as powerful as the united states .
<Sync time="163.550"/>
we think the u_n should try to make the security council
<Sync time="166.370"/>
more democratic and that removing the veto
<Sync time="168.850"/>
is the most obvious way to do so 
<Sync time="170.855"/>
and that it would allow smaller countries to have more influence on regional issues
<Sync time="174.825"/>
that affect them directly
<Sync time="176.730"/>
rather than having superpowers dictate policy to them .
<Sync time="180.255"/>

<Sync time="180.930"/>
our third argument and final one ,
<Sync time="183.080"/>
is that this prevent solutions to serious problems .
<Sync time="186.590"/>
for instance ,
<Sync time="187.790"/>
during the russian invasion of ukraine
<Sync time="190.060"/>
nothing was done to actually prevent the violence from spreading
<Sync time="193.480"/>
because russia was able to veto anything on the security council .
<Sync time="197.160"/>
indeed the u_s and britain didn't even bother bringing resolutions about the problem
<Sync time="201.600"/>
because they knew russia would veto it .
<Sync time="203.710"/>
emergencies of the sort that the u_n was created to solve
<Sync time="207.680"/>
are not able to be resolved in the united nations because of the veto .
<Sync time="212.470"/>
the other side might say ,
<Sync time="213.675"/>
look we were able to intervene in korea during the korean war ,
<Sync time="217.285"/>
but that was only possible because the soviet union at that time
<Sync time="220.700"/>
was protesting the u_n for not admitting , i think ukraine ,
<Sync time="224.450"/>
um and so they weren't voting . but in general , because one major power
<Sync time="229.100"/>
will always have it in their interest to support
<Sync time="231.265"/>
international aggression ,
<Sync time="232.680"/>
since in practice they back all of the countries that do this ,
<Sync time="236.160"/>
we think it's very unlikely that you'll ever be able to really solve a problem
<Sync time="239.400"/>
using the u_n security council as long as the veto exists .
<Sync time="243.005"/>
so for these reasons we should abolish the u_n security council veto .
<Sync time="247.250"/>
thank you .
