the motion for today's debate is that we should
<Sync time="3.050"/>
that holocaust denial
<Sync time="4.610"/>
should be a criminal offense .
<Sync time="6.530"/>
two main areas of clash , the first on why this is unprotected speech
<Sync time="10.870"/>
as per general freedom of speech 
<Sync time="12.770"/>
like laws .
<Sync time="13.845"/>
so
<Sync time="14.480"/>
recognize that we protect speech
<Sync time="16.415"/>
for most situations
<Sync time="18.170"/>
except in those where it is incendiary ,
<Sync time="20.440"/>
a_k_a a cult of violence ,
<Sync time="22.120"/>
or causes significant harm to others .
<Sync time="24.840"/>
this is why for example , you cannot yell
<Sync time="27.040"/>
fire in a crowded theater ,
<Sync time="28.650"/>
because clearly this is a situation in which
<Sync time="30.865"/>
your free speech
<Sync time="32.130"/>
causes significant harm to others
<Sync time="34.080"/>
that impedes their future rights .
<Sync time="36.200"/>
or for another example ,
<Sync time="38.430"/>
why , call to arms , by the communist party
<Sync time="41.200"/>
were not allowed on fliers because even though it is free speech to be a communist
<Sync time="46.100"/>
it is not free speech
<Sync time="47.380"/>
to yell
<Sync time="47.940"/>
let us demolish the capitalist world 
<Sync time="50.140"/>
through
<Sync time="50.620"/>
bringing up arms against our brethren .
<Sync time="53.170"/>
so recognize that holocaust denial
<Sync time="55.750"/>
clearly does both .
<Sync time="57.750"/>
first , it is often a call to violence against jews
<Sync time="60.700"/>
because they are seen as those people who unfairly put others in jail because they
<Sync time="65.700"/>
by faking the holocaust
<Sync time="68.100"/>
but and this
<Sync time="69.200"/>
leads to physical violence in and of itself .
<Sync time="71.800"/>
so how many times have we seen videos in which
<Sync time="74.500"/>
neo-nazis
<Sync time="75.550"/>
assault jews by yelling that they faked the holocaust
<Sync time="78.450"/>
and
<Sync time="78.845"/>
%hes use this as an avenue by which they can justify their future violence ?
<Sync time="83.200"/>
we also think that it causes
<Sync time="84.630"/>
deep psychological harm to those listening ,
<Sync time="87.120"/>
especially those of jewish descent or survivors of the holocaust ,
<Sync time="90.790"/>
because it {devalidates/invalidates} their experiences
<Sync time="93.200"/>
and says
<Sync time="94.375"/>
you made this up , 
<Sync time="96.090"/>
you didn't actually experience the pain that you did before .
<Sync time="99.710"/>
recognize that there is also no difference between psychological and physical harm
<Sync time="103.885"/>
other than the stigma that we have put in society 
<Sync time="106.200"/>
upon it .
<Sync time="107.000"/>
because even when %hes when
<Sync time="108.780"/>
even our like chemical connections in our brain
<Sync time="111.410"/>
fire the same way if you are to cut me
<Sync time="113.785"/>
then if you are to verbally assault me .
<Sync time="116.075"/>
we think that at that point they become indistinguishable from each other .
<Sync time="119.630"/>
there's also long term physical harm to jewish communities
<Sync time="122.370"/>
when they are {de-validated/invalidated} and broken apart by this kind of speech .
<Sync time="125.910"/>
so
<Sync time="126.705"/>
once we recognize that it is
<Sync time="128.300"/>
unprotected speech we can then
<Sync time="130.480"/>
criminalize it off that
<Sync time="131.740"/>
alone .
<Sync time="132.385"/>
but second , let's talk about societal impacts . because we think that if you can show if we can show you
<Sync time="137.220"/>
that there is enough
<Sync time="138.120"/>
bad harms associated with holocaust denial ,
<Sync time="141.060"/>
then
<Sync time="141.320"/>
we don't care if it's free speech that ought be protected ,
<Sync time="144.080"/>
it ought be banned 
<Sync time="144.940"/>
based on a utilitarian framework
<Sync time="146.720"/>
in which we see that the harms
<Sync time="148.350"/>
outweigh the like
<Sync time="149.820"/>
principled stance .
<Sync time="151.520"/>
so let's talk about damage to jewish communities .
<Sync time="153.960"/>
because when you {de-validate/invalidate} a community
<Sync time="156.125"/>
and cause others to see it is untrustworthy ,
<Sync time="158.840"/>
it means you are taking away
<Sync time="160.720"/>
first , a lot of the infrastructure that comes in from other communities ,
<Sync time="164.040"/>
but also and like public support ,
<Sync time="166.585"/>
but also psychologically damaging the individuals that compose that community .
<Sync time="170.900"/>
you're {de-validating/invalidating} survivors' experiences ,
<Sync time="173.305"/>
and it tells families that the losses they experienced
<Sync time="175.950"/>
are fake .
<Sync time="176.790"/>
this is anger that never gets answered on their side of the house
<Sync time="180.100"/>
when holoc- when
<Sync time="181.310"/>
holocost holocaust deniers
<Sync time="183.690"/>
get to walk free
<Sync time="184.950"/>
after actively harming
<Sync time="186.480"/>
those who have to listen to them .
<Sync time="188.560"/>
we think that as with any kind of crime that causes a harm
<Sync time="192.090"/>
it is only just if they also have to pay the price of a criminal offense .
<Sync time="196.000"/>
so if
<Sync time="196.775"/>
one of these nazis was to come up and stab a member of the jewish community
<Sync time="200.630"/>
they would necessarily be placed in jail than have to pay
<Sync time="203.800"/>
like some sort of retributive price on this .
<Sync time="206.010"/>
we think that it is no different
<Sync time="207.390"/>
when they tell someone that
<Sync time="208.605"/>
they're like that the holocaust is faked
<Sync time="211.020"/>
insofar as the same kind of harm is caused .
<Sync time="213.395"/>
but next we want and finally we want to talk about children .
<Sync time="216.390"/>
because we think that holocaust denial
<Sync time="218.125"/>
is especially damaging when it is allowed into our schools
<Sync time="220.965"/>
and allowed to be spouted by teachers .
<Sync time="223.080"/>
very recently there was a scenario in which one
<Sync time="226.045"/>
%hes a child was allowed to write an entire essay
<Sync time="228.810"/>
on how the holocaust was fake 
<Sync time="230.490"/>
with sources brought up to verify it .
<Sync time="232.720"/>
we think that children are often more impressionable than adults
<Sync time="235.480"/>
and that in these situations children very well
<Sync time="237.950"/>
do believe that the holocaust might have been faked .
<Sync time="240.545"/>
this creates a long term unsafe and more hateful world
<Sync time="243.655"/>
in which children are essentially
<Sync time="245.120"/>
raised with anti-semitism .
<Sync time="246.870"/>
don't let them poison the minds of our youth ,
<Sync time="249.010"/>
we think that it ought be a criminal offense .
<Sync time="251.130"/>
for these reasons proud to propose .
<Sync time="254.080"/>
