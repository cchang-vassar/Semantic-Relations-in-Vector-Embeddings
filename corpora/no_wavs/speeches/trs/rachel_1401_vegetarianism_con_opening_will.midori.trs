<Sync time="0.625"/>
three main arguments as to why
<Sync time="3.025"/>
we should not necessarily
<Sync time="4.670"/>
adopted vegetarianism .
<Sync time="6.560"/>
first let's talk about cultural validity .
<Sync time="8.680"/>
so first , it's unclear why we have to respect animal rights ,
<Sync time="12.390"/>
infinitely .
<Sync time="13.230"/>
there have been multiple differences that have been 
<Sync time="15.220"/>
pointing
<Sync time="15.750"/>
pointed out by philosophers
<Sync time="17.290"/>
that necessarily mean that even if animals qualify for some rights they definitely don't qualify to all of the rights that a human being might have .
<Sync time="24.300"/>
first , they oftentimes don't carry the same level of sentience and those that do we do not eat .
<Sync time="29.610"/>
um but second ,
<Sync time="30.645"/>
animals don't really have a conception of the f- future versus the past and of their existence
<Sync time="35.810"/>
in that timeline .
<Sync time="37.020"/>
rather , they have
<Sync time="38.170"/>
a sense of their current self and of current existence and of current biological drives
<Sync time="43.075"/>
but they can't actually imagine themselves in the future and they can't contextualize themselves there .
<Sync time="48.190"/>
which means when you kill an animal it's not the same as killing a human ,
<Sync time="51.540"/>
you're not
<Sync time="52.035"/>
removing that animals
<Sync time="53.480"/>
like infinitely long life before their eyes because they couldn't conceptualize that life
<Sync time="58.430"/>
in the first place .
<Sync time="60.400"/>
what this means
<Sync time="61.360"/>
is that there isn't a good reason not to kill an animal , you're not taking anything away from it
<Sync time="65.350"/>
and as long as you're doing so in a humane manner
<Sync time="67.740"/>
there isn't actually an ethical dilemma .
<Sync time="70.140"/>
so ,
<Sync time="70.650"/>
yeah , right now we have a problem with factory farming .
<Sync time="73.360"/>
i'll tell you later why this problem exists on both sides of the house ,
<Sync time="76.670"/>
but we think that this is something that we can work towards fixing
<Sync time="79.250"/>
um and something that we can
<Sync time="81.040"/>
like adjust to over time ,
<Sync time="82.500"/>
like sustainable and ethical farming .
<Sync time="84.660"/>
at that point we think that people's cultures and their happiness becomes
<Sync time="88.500"/>
infinitely more important than this animal's life .
<Sync time="90.950"/>
if this is part of your identity
<Sync time="92.630"/>
it can be really impact how you relate your culture and yourself to lose it .
<Sync time="96.350"/>
because recognize that for a lot of people
<Sync time="98.535"/>
growing up eating meat as part of cultural celebrations , as part of
<Sync time="102.210"/>
celebrations of yourself , or maybe it's just the meal that your mother made every night when you guys couldn't really afford anything else ,
<Sync time="108.510"/>
all of these are valid modes of self expression and self identity .
<Sync time="112.090"/>
and we think that when you f- like create a world in which it becomes
<Sync time="114.860"/>
preferable
<Sync time="116.010"/>
to adopt vegetarianism , you make it preferable
<Sync time="119.400"/>
to stop believing in these , t- to stop uh
<Sync time="122.000"/>
adopting to yourself .
<Sync time="123.870"/>
so
<Sync time="124.350"/>
we think that like people should be able to have their preferences
<Sync time="127.795"/>
and should be able to eat m- meat if they so desire .
<Sync time="130.500"/>
our second area of clash has to do with ease of access and expenses ,
<Sync time="134.310"/>
because
<Sync time="134.970"/>
even though it might be reasonable for someone to go vegetarian it is still incredibly difficult to make that lifestyle shift .
<Sync time="142.455"/>
when you grow up with one specific diet where you know that you'll be healthy eating it
<Sync time="146.760"/>
and suddenly you have to switch to something completely different ,
<Sync time="150.040"/>
we think that a lot of the times you actually run into a lot of problems with being healthy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle ,
<Sync time="155.490"/>
once you switch ,
<Sync time="156.460"/>
because your body is very unused to the way that you are now consuming these
<Sync time="159.540"/>
nutrients
<Sync time="160.285"/>
and sometimes you're so unused to it that you don't necessarily know how to consume the same number of necessary nutrients the same way .
<Sync time="166.185"/>

<Sync time="166.750"/>
so
<Sync time="167.575"/>
we think that
<Sync time="168.695"/>
meat is something that most people understand how to cook ,
<Sync time="171.825"/>
it has the same health composition that they've been living with their whole life so they can
<Sync time="176.070"/>
live off of diets that have meat in them without becoming unhealthy
<Sync time="179.720"/>
and they also exist
<Sync time="181.590"/>
um
<Sync time="182.485"/>
in like most supermarkets
<Sync time="185.070"/>
regardless of what demographic you're living in .
<Sync time="187.540"/>
and um
<Sync time="188.360"/>
it's like very convenient for you to make , people know how to cook it
<Sync time="191.280"/>
and it's usually pretty cheap .
<Sync time="192.980"/>
and honestly it's usually cheaper than getting enough vegetables that will keep you full in the same way .
<Sync time="197.825"/>
and so we prefer that people be able to have this ease of access .
<Sync time="201.800"/>
our third area of clash has to do with the possibility of sustainability .
<Sync time="205.780"/>
because factory farming is going to exist on both sides of the house ,
<Sync time="210.280"/>
the question is just are we factory farming animals or are we doing the same thing with vegetables ,
<Sync time="215.100"/>
but
<Sync time="215.480"/>
in both worlds you're going to have real people and real animals who being harmed in the process
<Sync time="220.640"/>
because you don't actually change the market incentives .
<Sync time="223.355"/>
in fact you're just saying , hey look
<Sync time="225.475"/>
now we're going to buy a crapload of this
<Sync time="227.185"/>
other product , you better switch to focusing on mass producing
<Sync time="230.490"/>
that .
<Sync time="231.390"/>
so
<Sync time="231.910"/>
basically what they're side is creating is a world in which we can jump
<Sync time="235.310"/>
from trend to trend
<Sync time="236.520"/>
without actually solving the underlying issue .
<Sync time="239.590"/>
it means that we only changed the facade
<Sync time="241.745"/>
without discussing
<Sync time="243.100"/>
more ethical ways of farming or sustainability or hydroponics .
<Sync time="247.295"/>
and so we think that our side of the house is actually going to provide you a world in which we can face
<Sync time="251.325"/>
the actual problem .
<Sync time="252.540"/>
for these reasons proud to oppose .
<Sync time="255.430"/>
