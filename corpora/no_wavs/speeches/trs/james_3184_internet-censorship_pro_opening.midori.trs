we should increase internet censorship .
<Sync time="3.235"/>
by this we mean that countries in which the internet is basically laissez faire
<Sync time="7.430"/>
and not regulated
<Sync time="8.660"/>
should introduce limits on what content people are allowed access .
<Sync time="12.790"/>
for instance we see that recently britain has taken steps to limit people's access to pornography
<Sync time="18.155"/>
and we think that that's the kind of thing we're debating about here .
<Sync time="20.940"/>
not a sort of chinese system wherein people don't have access to most of the internet ,
<Sync time="25.500"/>
but one in which the government filters certain content 
<Sync time="28.390"/>
and i think the debate comes down to what that content
<Sync time="30.870"/>
ought to be .
<Sync time="31.965"/>
our first argument is about limiting access to obscene material .
<Sync time="36.450"/>
now i'm not going to defend the conservative ban in britain
<Sync time="39.400"/>
of pornographic material ,
<Sync time="41.160"/>
but i do think that everyone can agree that things like child pornography shouldn't be accessible
<Sync time="45.905"/>
in any country .
<Sync time="47.375"/>
i think that you can use internet censorship to make it more difficult for people to , one ,
<Sync time="51.960"/>
access ,
<Sync time="52.710"/>
and two , distribute child pornography .
<Sync time="55.355"/>
in doing so , you also reduce the incentives for its creation .
<Sync time="59.150"/>
which means that you can reduce the amount of child abuse going on
<Sync time="62.120"/>
within and without your country .
<Sync time="64.550"/>
we think that this is obviously a huge end and that even if you lose out on some legitimate content ,
<Sync time="69.620"/>
the benefits that accrue by limiting child abuse
<Sync time="72.390"/>
greatly outweigh them so we're willing to bite that harm .
<Sync time="76.085"/>
our second argument is about
<Sync time="78.670"/>
radicalism
<Sync time="79.530"/>
online .
<Sync time="80.870"/>
we see that since the early days of the internet ,
<Sync time="83.460"/>
radical groups have used it to recruit members .
<Sync time="86.280"/>
whether that be al qaeda in the early two thousands ,
<Sync time="89.430"/>
isis in recent years , or now
<Sync time="91.490"/>
the alt right and neo-nazis in america and europe today .
<Sync time="95.450"/>
isis for instance has used twitter as one of their main resources to get young men in europe to join their cause .
<Sync time="102.850"/>
attackers in france , belgium , and britain have all been found to be radicalized
<Sync time="107.220"/>
online .
<Sync time="108.390"/>
we think that at that point ,
<Sync time="109.620"/>
when certain material online
<Sync time="111.280"/>
poses a real threat to the safety
<Sync time="113.215"/>
of a nation ,
<Sync time="114.285"/>
that it is acceptable to censor
<Sync time="116.600"/>
access to radical islamic materials .
<Sync time="119.360"/>
if fewer young men had access to these materials , then fewer would become terrorists because
<Sync time="124.215"/>
this is the means by which they are being radicalized .
<Sync time="127.550"/>
so we think that this is ultimately a tool to fight against terrorism .
<Sync time="130.885"/>

<Sync time="131.510"/>
but moreover , the alt right
<Sync time="133.540"/>
has used the internet as a way to legitimize their narrative about white supremacy , 
<Sync time="138.130"/>
racism , and bigotry .
<Sync time="140.370"/>
because the internet acts as an amplifying chamber wherein a few ,
<Sync time="144.155"/>
hardcore , neo-nazi types
<Sync time="146.360"/>
can seem much more popular than they are .
<Sync time="149.030"/>
this draws people in to think that their message is normal
<Sync time="151.780"/>
and ultimately makes more people think that this kind of discourse is acceptable 
<Sync time="155.840"/>
even though it isn't .
<Sync time="157.060"/>
at the end of the day we think that it's worth it to censor access to this type of material
<Sync time="161.330"/>
so that people don't think that being
<Sync time="163.060"/>
a fascist is acceptable nowadays , when in fact of course it isn't .
<Sync time="167.210"/>
and that the harms that these
<Sync time="168.950"/>
alt righters pr- pose to democracy ,
<Sync time="171.660"/>
ultimately makes it acceptable for the state to take extreme action ,
<Sync time="174.820"/>
like censoring the internet .
<Sync time="178.120"/>
our third and final argument
<Sync time="179.585"/>
is perhaps a little less important than those but still matters to some people ,
<Sync time="183.720"/>
namely private property violations on the internet .
<Sync time="187.420"/>
now
<Sync time="187.910"/>
many people are not sympathetic to the big 
<Sync time="190.390"/>
hollywood movie studios and the big record companies who are losing money due to piracy ,
<Sync time="195.080"/>
but remember that this also affects artists and independent labels
<Sync time="198.865"/>
and indie uh
<Sync time="199.850"/>
film houses as well .
<Sync time="201.605"/>
at the end of the day , piracy has greatly reduced the profitability of music
<Sync time="205.910"/>
and film .
<Sync time="207.120"/>
there's much less incentive to produce music and film ,
<Sync time="209.700"/>
especially to take risks
<Sync time="211.280"/>
on new genres or new artists ,
<Sync time="214.220"/>
if you know that the amount of profit you receive is going to be much lower than it was
<Sync time="218.080"/>
twenty years ago before widespread piracy .
<Sync time="221.850"/>
we think that this disproportionately harms groups that haven't had
<Sync time="224.610"/>
access to the media
<Sync time="226.340"/>
production in the past .
<Sync time="228.025"/>
that it's less likely that we'll see
<Sync time="229.800"/>
types of media targeting new groups or groups that pirate more often , such as low income people ,
<Sync time="234.785"/>
because there's no money to be made if everyone just gets everything on the pirate bay .
<Sync time="238.855"/>
so we think that it would be acceptable to censor
<Sync time="241.800"/>
websites like the pirate bay if it means that more people
<Sync time="244.730"/>
are consuming media legitimately .
<Sync time="246.970"/>
for all of these reasons
<Sync time="248.445"/>
we think that we should increase
<Sync time="250.300"/>
internet censorship .
<Sync time="251.670"/>
thank you .
