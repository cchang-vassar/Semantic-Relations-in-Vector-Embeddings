we should not
<Sync time="1.750"/>
legalize polygamy .
<Sync time="3.760"/>
we're going to argue first , that it would be preferable to do away with the institution of marriage entirely
<Sync time="9.450"/>
rather than to expand it to include
<Sync time="11.430"/>
polygamy and polyamory ,
<Sync time="13.175"/>
and secondly , that even if you want to maintain the institution of marriage
<Sync time="17.020"/>
that this doesn't make good legal sense .
<Sync time="19.735"/>

<Sync time="20.650"/>
so we tell you that ultimately it would simply be preferable to do away with marriage rather than to expand it in this way .
<Sync time="26.720"/>
why ?
<Sync time="27.575"/>
marriage is an institution that is founded primarily on coercion .
<Sync time="31.950"/>
the history of marriage
<Sync time="33.970"/>
is essentially that it's important for men to be able to control women
<Sync time="38.240"/>
in order to assert their own reproductive worth . to be sure that their children are legitimate .
<Sync time="43.295"/>
so marriage as an institution has this kind of sordid history which we think is
<Sync time="48.000"/>
a good reason to begin questioning it , but that's not enough to ban it in itself .
<Sync time="52.390"/>
the reason why it ought be banned is that ultimately marriage preferences ,
<Sync time="55.975"/>
certain lifestyles over others 
<Sync time="58.000"/>
even if you expand it
<Sync time="59.230"/>
to include polygamy .
<Sync time="61.180"/>
at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="62.150"/>
marriage essentially is a government sanctioning for one particular lifestyle .
<Sync time="66.940"/>
this may be expanded to include slightly more people as we've seen recently with the legalization of same sex marriage
<Sync time="73.700"/>
in the u_s and britain ,
<Sync time="75.480"/>
but ultimately we tell you that it still prioritizes people having
<Sync time="78.930"/>
long term relationships over short term ones , living with their partner over not cohabitating ,
<Sync time="83.990"/>
and otherwise makes normative judgments about how people ought to live their life .
<Sync time="88.880"/>
tim told you in the last speech that the state should not be in the business
<Sync time="92.570"/>
of telling people what is right and wrong and how to live their lives
<Sync time="95.855"/>
when they don't hurt other people .
<Sync time="97.780"/>
but by giving legal privileges to people who are married , such as tax breaks ,
<Sync time="102.370"/>
next of kin status , the ability to live together in some countries , etcetera ,
<Sync time="107.200"/>
ultimately you are effectively prioritizing one lifestyle over another .
<Sync time="111.450"/>
and we think that this should fundamentally be done away with
<Sync time="114.160"/>
rather than expanded .
<Sync time="115.670"/>
marriage doesn't become any less problematic just because you include gay people
<Sync time="119.525"/>
or polygamous people , you're just changing the group of people who are an out group .
<Sync time="123.910"/>
at the end of the day , we think that in a world where you banned marriage , people would still be able to
<Sync time="128.610"/>
claim one another on their taxes , it would just work differently .
<Sync time="131.940"/>
people would still be able to get married in the church if they want to ,
<Sync time="135.370"/>
something that's unlikely to be expanded either way .
<Sync time="138.050"/>
so if people want marriage for social reasons
<Sync time="140.620"/>
they can go out and have that without state recognition and we're fine with that .
<Sync time="144.530"/>
we just don't think that it's good practice for the state
<Sync time="147.030"/>
to condone this behavior
<Sync time="148.960"/>
because
<Sync time="149.390"/>
implicitly when you do so , you condemn
<Sync time="151.825"/>
other harmless behavior .
<Sync time="154.010"/>

<Sync time="154.520"/>

<Sync time="155.040"/>
our second argument is that polygamous marriage doesn't really make sense
<Sync time="158.760"/>
from a legal perspective .
<Sync time="160.320"/>

<Sync time="161.220"/>
realize that from the state's perspective 
<Sync time="163.090"/>
marriage is a contract between two people .
<Sync time="165.825"/>
at the end of the day , it's about being able to write someone off on your taxes ,
<Sync time="169.950"/>
it's about being their next of kin ,
<Sync time="171.990"/>
it's about being allowed to 
<Sync time="173.375"/>
share credit cards and other financial vehicles .
<Sync time="176.230"/>
the state doesn't really care if you love one another or how you spend your time
<Sync time="180.040"/>
all it does is allow you to act as a sort of joint person from a legal perspective 
<Sync time="184.390"/>
in certain instances .
<Sync time="186.310"/>
all of this kind of works when it's between two people ,
<Sync time="189.260"/>
but at the end of the day this starts to break down when we have
<Sync time="191.880"/>
larger polygamous relationships .
<Sync time="194.310"/>
if you have five people living together and you're allowed to claim them all on your taxes 
<Sync time="198.660"/>
this could allow even very wealthy people to write off almost all of their income because of how the u_s tax code works .
<Sync time="204.730"/>
and there are %hes similar benefits to larger family size
<Sync time="208.340"/>
in other countries .
<Sync time="209.740"/>
i'm not claiming that people are going to run out and
<Sync time="211.580"/>
have polygamous marriages in order to save money ,
<Sync time="214.430"/>
only to say that existing laws would break down
<Sync time="217.230"/>
if you allow %hes
<Sync time="218.535"/>
polygamous marriages .
<Sync time="219.970"/>
the tax code
<Sync time="221.090"/>
and other laws relating to marriage simply weren't designed with this in mind .
<Sync time="224.885"/>
the other team is going to say ,
<Sync time="226.550"/>
oh well then change them .
<Sync time="228.305"/>
but at that point if we're overhauling huge parts of the legal system ,
<Sync time="232.130"/>
why not go one step further and get rid of this entirely 
<Sync time="234.965"/>
and just allow people to decide if they want to let someone else claim them on their taxes
<Sync time="239.260"/>
without requiring this archaic institution
<Sync time="241.820"/>
with its sexist
<Sync time="242.970"/>
and ultimately problematic roots to continue .
<Sync time="245.790"/>
for all these reasons we should not legalize polygamy .
<Sync time="248.860"/>
thank you .
