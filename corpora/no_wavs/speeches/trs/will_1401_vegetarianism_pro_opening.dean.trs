i'm proud to stand in proposition of the motion that we should adopt vegetarianism .
<Sync time="5.180"/>
as a model
<Sync time="6.400"/>
we want to establish that this is a
<Sync time="8.595"/>
debate about whether or not it would be preferable soc-
<Sync time="11.230"/>
for society to voluntarily accept this diet change .
<Sync time="14.970"/>
we're not going to implement policies that would force people to become vegetarians ,
<Sync time="19.470"/>
rather we just think that this is a preferable lifestyle choice for people to make
<Sync time="23.770"/>
on an individual level , but especially on a societal level in aggregation .
<Sync time="29.320"/>
our first independent point
<Sync time="30.845"/>
is animal rights .
<Sync time="32.380"/>
so we think that animal rights stem from just sort of like a pain
<Sync time="35.780"/>
%hes
<Sync time="36.680"/>
like a like a suffering slash like happiness uh perspective that
<Sync time="40.880"/>
if there is suffering in the world it is bad regardless of where that suffering comes from
<Sync time="45.660"/>
and we think that intelligence-based
<Sync time="47.670"/>
you know frameworks of whether or not something has rights are inherently elitist .
<Sync time="51.920"/>
at that point then
<Sync time="53.340"/>
if it is important to respect animal rights ,
<Sync time="55.940"/>
there is obviously a need to become vegetarian ,
<Sync time="58.790"/>
insofar as vegetarianism
<Sync time="60.730"/>
one
<Sync time="61.450"/>
reduce uh
<Sync time="62.225"/>
eliminates the moral complicity in the suffering of animals of factory farming .
<Sync time="66.430"/>
these are obviously pretty extreme forms of suffering .
<Sync time="69.600"/>
chickens that are kept in tight coops for example or
<Sync time="72.660"/>
cows that are given or really any livestock that isn't given sufficient space ,
<Sync time="76.770"/>
but also the way in which they are
<Sync time="78.390"/>
systemically executed . if you think life has any intrinsic value this is bad
<Sync time="82.910"/>
but also the ways in which the animals are killed are often brutal and gruesome .
<Sync time="87.080"/>
at that point then we think that there is a moral imperative to reduce your complicity in it .
<Sync time="91.545"/>
but secondly when you have a society of vegetarians you obviously eliminate the demand for this product in the first place
<Sync time="98.430"/>
and as a result there is a tangible change
<Sync time="100.725"/>
in whether or not it happens because
<Sync time="102.600"/>
nobody actually is buying the products that facilitate the suffering in the first place .
<Sync time="108.130"/>
our second independent point is environmental impacts .
<Sync time="111.260"/>
we think first that livestock is an inefficient use of land and water
<Sync time="115.015"/>
that just growing produce is just a
<Sync time="117.035"/>
better way to use this because it
<Sync time="119.060"/>
you know demands less from the system .
<Sync time="121.140"/>
that in turn means that there are less things contributing to
<Sync time="124.160"/>
droughts and other resource shortages
<Sync time="126.325"/>
but other that there is less
<Sync time="127.770"/>
also that there is less over farming of land that you
<Sync time="130.430"/>
you know don't deplete soil in the way that you do when you have it you know
<Sync time="134.180"/>
actually like just absolutely mutilated by livestock .
<Sync time="137.990"/>
in that sense then
<Sync time="139.210"/>
you have a infrastructure for food that is more capable of sustaining large populations at affordable rates .
<Sync time="145.360"/>
that's important for things like global hunger
<Sync time="147.770"/>
but it's also important at a local level for insuring that people's you know
<Sync time="151.235"/>
%hes
<Sync time="151.910"/>
expenditures on foods
<Sync time="153.510"/>
food is lower .
<Sync time="154.670"/>
beyond this though , in terms of the local environment ,
<Sync time="157.350"/>
we also think that there's a significant impact on global warming created by the agricultural industry .
<Sync time="162.770"/>
methane for example that's like common in just like
<Sync time="165.715"/>
general biological waste generated by livestock
<Sync time="169.015"/>
is a significant contributing factor to emission
<Sync time="171.940"/>
that drive
<Sync time="172.720"/>

<Sync time="173.220"/>
global warming . as such
<Sync time="175.300"/>
then we think it is
<Sync time="176.250"/>
important
<Sync time="177.050"/>
to mitigate the extent to which livestock are actually bred and born
<Sync time="181.415"/>
in which in turn then contributes to global warming .
<Sync time="185.400"/>
our third independent point
<Sync time="186.840"/>
is health of the individual .
<Sync time="188.730"/>
so we think that just being a vegetarian is a healthier lifestyle .
<Sync time="192.110"/>
um red meat in particular is uh you know there are
<Sync time="195.820"/>
plethora of studies demonstrating that red meat is carcinogenic .
<Sync time="199.390"/>
we also think that
<Sync time="200.345"/>
you know um this meat is often laden with fat and other you know harmful ingredients that just aren't particularly healthy .
<Sync time="207.590"/>
and beyond just the individual benefits of being healthy ,
<Sync time="210.250"/>
you know longer lifespan , happier lifestyle ,
<Sync time="213.540"/>
you know the mental impacts of just being healthy
<Sync time="216.010"/>
um there's also larger societal impacts uh for example
<Sync time="219.830"/>
decreased healthcare costs which actually have a ripple effect across
<Sync time="223.270"/>
all of society
<Sync time="224.530"/>
because no longer do you have a system that requires um healthy individuals to subsidize comparatively less healthy individuals .
<Sync time="231.945"/>
that in turn means a society that spends less on healthcare costs
<Sync time="235.660"/>
and more on other things that are presumably you know
<Sync time="238.535"/>
good uses of your money when you don't have to spend it on healthcare .
<Sync time="242.340"/>
also there's just less suffering now because less people are unhealthy and have to get healthcare in the first place for things like heart conditions .
<Sync time="249.780"/>
proud to propose .
<Sync time="251.893"/>
