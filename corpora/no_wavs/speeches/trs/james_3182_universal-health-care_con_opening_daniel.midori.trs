we should not introduce universal healthcare .
<Sync time="3.855"/>
i want to clarify a couple of things before i launch into our three constructive arguments .
<Sync time="9.610"/>
the first is that this universal health care implies that people have some sort of buy in ,
<Sync time="14.710"/>
whether that be requiring people to have private insurance
<Sync time="17.950"/>
as is the case in some countries ,
<Sync time="19.680"/>
or introducing some sort of public insurance scheme like the united kingdom has .
<Sync time="23.955"/>
ultimately people are paying for their premiums either in the form of taxes
<Sync time="28.020"/>
or payments to a private insurance company .
<Sync time="30.420"/>
and all universal health care does is require everyone to do this
<Sync time="34.040"/>
and not {allows/allow} people to choose to opt out
<Sync time="36.470"/>
as they used to be able to
<Sync time="37.870"/>
in the united states .
<Sync time="39.550"/>
so from this perspective , even the united states , which requires people to purchase private health care ,
<Sync time="44.510"/>
has universal health care .
<Sync time="46.430"/>
our first argument is that it is unfair to make
<Sync time="49.460"/>
young people subsidize older people .
<Sync time="52.860"/>
how does health insurance work ?
<Sync time="54.880"/>
basically healthy people have to buy a product that they don't need
<Sync time="58.560"/>
in order to let
<Sync time="59.700"/>
less healthy people get that product
<Sync time="62.030"/>
at an affordable price .
<Sync time="63.850"/>
so young people who probably don't need to go to the doctor more than once a year for a quick check up
<Sync time="68.950"/>
are forced to pay for very expensive insurance schemes
<Sync time="72.020"/>
so that elderly people who consume
<Sync time="74.030"/>
huge amounts of resources are able to receive
<Sync time="76.615"/>
those same treatments more cheaply .
<Sync time="78.890"/>
we think that this is fundamentally unfair .
<Sync time="81.140"/>
people ought not be forced to subsidize others
<Sync time="83.845"/>
and take on huge risks to themselves .
<Sync time="86.140"/>
but i think in particular that it's unfair because
<Sync time="89.010"/>
elderly people are not asked to subsidize young people in the same way .
<Sync time="93.300"/>
in countries like the u_s or britain for instance ,
<Sync time="95.490"/>
young people have to pay huge amounts of money to attend
<Sync time="98.100"/>
university and don't receive public subsidy 
<Sync time="100.740"/>
to do so .
<Sync time="101.950"/>
so ultimately we think that this is a one way street ,
<Sync time="104.310"/>
that you're requiring younger people to pay for the elderly
<Sync time="107.115"/>
and not investing in a similar way 
<Sync time="109.305"/>
in helping the young .
<Sync time="110.900"/>
we think that if anything , society should work the other way . it should take from older people who have had time
<Sync time="115.660"/>
to accrue more resources and give it to younger people who haven't 
<Sync time="118.795"/>
and who represent the future .
<Sync time="120.930"/>
this also punishes healthy people by extension .
<Sync time="124.025"/>
if you run every day for your whole life and eat a healthy diet ,
<Sync time="127.870"/>
then you're much less likely to need expensive health care
<Sync time="130.540"/>
in your old age than someone who smokes a pack a day
<Sync time="133.505"/>
and eats nothing but cheeseburgers .
<Sync time="135.470"/>
so healthy people are being forced to pay for the health insurance of people who made worse decisions .
<Sync time="140.660"/>
this , one ,
<Sync time="141.620"/>
disincentivizes people from making good decisions 
<Sync time="144.910"/>
and two , punishes people who did make good decisions , which we think
<Sync time="148.670"/>
fundamentally is unfair .
<Sync time="150.770"/>
we think that if you choose to make decisions that make your health care costs lower ,
<Sync time="154.840"/>
that you shouldn't have to bear the higher cost for those
<Sync time="157.210"/>
who didn't make those good choices .
<Sync time="159.640"/>
at the end of the day ,
<Sync time="160.610"/>
forcing everyone to pay for health insurance , whether through a government scheme like national health in britain ,
<Sync time="165.760"/>
or through mandatory private insurance like obamacare ,
<Sync time="168.805"/>
is unfair to many groups of society .
<Sync time="171.580"/>
it either punishes them based on an intrinsic characteristic like age ,
<Sync time="175.280"/>
or it punishes those who made good decisions and privileges those who made poor decisions .
<Sync time="179.995"/>
we think either option is unacceptable .
<Sync time="182.460"/>

<Sync time="183.770"/>
our third and final point is that this forces people to fund controversial treatments .
<Sync time="188.020"/>
in the united states no federal money may be used for abortions .
<Sync time="192.530"/>
but we still see that government health money
<Sync time="194.980"/>
goes to fund things like
<Sync time="196.970"/>
treatments that
<Sync time="198.335"/>
would not otherwise be covered .
<Sync time="200.510"/>
for instance treatments that use stem cell research 
<Sync time="203.660"/>
which many people consider to be unethical .
<Sync time="206.320"/>
we don't think that people ought be compelled to pay for treatments which are contrary
<Sync time="210.850"/>
to their own moral principles .
<Sync time="212.890"/>
to do so
<Sync time="213.610"/>
undermines the ability of people to live according to their own ethical principles when they don't conflict with anyone else .
<Sync time="219.980"/>
if people want to receive abortions we think that that's fine .
<Sync time="222.780"/>
if people want to use the products of stem cell research we're similarly okay with that ,
<Sync time="227.100"/>
but we think that it's wrong to compel christians
<Sync time="229.560"/>
to pay for that ,
<Sync time="230.640"/>
which necessarily a national healthcare scheme that pays for those things
<Sync time="234.400"/>
would do .
<Sync time="235.265"/>
so at the end of the day we oppose forcing people to purchase insurance because it's unfair to certain groups 
<Sync time="240.705"/>
based on their beliefs .
<Sync time="242.020"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="243.039"/>
