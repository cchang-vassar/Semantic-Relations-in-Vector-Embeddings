we should end
<Sync time="1.540"/>
cheerleading .
<Sync time="2.525"/>
so we think that
<Sync time="4.345"/>
the u_s predominantly , but also other countries where cheerleading has taken hold ,
<Sync time="9.210"/>
should pass legislation to end public support for it ,
<Sync time="12.740"/>
and that we shouldn't have things like cheerleaders at
<Sync time="15.680"/>
pro sports games or parades and other events .
<Sync time="19.080"/>
we would prefer a world where cheerleading was done away with ,
<Sync time="22.010"/>
even if it's not explicitly banned .
<Sync time="24.905"/>
a couple of arguments for our side .
<Sync time="27.660"/>
the first is that we think cheerleading is demeaning to women .
<Sync time="31.090"/>

<Sync time="31.770"/>
at its root ,
<Sync time="32.520"/>
cheerleading
<Sync time="33.660"/>
equates women's appearance with men's ability .
<Sync time="37.595"/>
so ,
<Sync time="38.580"/>
because cheerleading is usually associated in the u_s , where almost all cheerleaders are located ,
<Sync time="43.860"/>
with sports like football ,
<Sync time="45.930"/>
ultimately you are equating the football players with the cheerleaders .
<Sync time="50.060"/>
but how are these two things different ?
<Sync time="52.290"/>
the football players are exhibiting athletic prowess and
<Sync time="56.345"/>
incredible skill and talent , in a way
<Sync time="58.905"/>
where people respect them because of the hard work that they put in
<Sync time="62.140"/>
and their incredible skill .
<Sync time="63.705"/>
the cheerleaders
<Sync time="64.970"/>
certainly do work hard and i don't want to say that they're not ,
<Sync time="68.170"/>
and that they don't have skill because clearly they do ,
<Sync time="70.830"/>
and their routines are quite complex ,
<Sync time="73.020"/>
but they're being valued more for their appearance and attractiveness ,
<Sync time="76.570"/>
more than anything else .
<Sync time="78.640"/>
what's more , they're being used as a display to encourage the football players and to
<Sync time="83.330"/>
encourage fans to be more supportive of their team ,
<Sync time="86.540"/>
rather than being celebrated in their own right .
<Sync time="89.180"/>
and while it's true that there are now standalone cheerleading competitions today ,
<Sync time="93.610"/>
people still generally associate cheerleading with this
<Sync time="96.700"/>
traditional role that they've had in encouraging
<Sync time="99.165"/>
football players and other athletes to play better ,
<Sync time="102.070"/>
and encouraging people to root better for their male
<Sync time="105.470"/>
uh compatriots .
<Sync time="107.110"/>
so ultimately , because
<Sync time="109.300"/>
cheerleading reduces women to the status of props for men's athletics ,
<Sync time="113.760"/>
we think that this is really demeaning .
<Sync time="115.745"/>
that it encourages people to ignore
<Sync time="117.875"/>
these women's abilities or skills or talents , and only look to their appearance
<Sync time="122.315"/>
and how well they encourage the fans to root for their
<Sync time="125.030"/>
uh male counterparts .
<Sync time="126.910"/>
ultimately , this seems very demeaning to the women who participate in this .
<Sync time="130.430"/>
and we think that the alternative world in which these women are
<Sync time="133.315"/>
playing sports on their own , or participating in other activities
<Sync time="136.930"/>
where they can be celebrated and rewarded for their hard work ,
<Sync time="139.880"/>
would be a better one
<Sync time="140.980"/>
compared to the world in which they are cheerleaders .
<Sync time="143.850"/>
i know the other side will say that people
<Sync time="146.365"/>
like
<Sync time="146.920"/>
opt into being cheerleaders and want to do this ,
<Sync time="149.870"/>
but that doesn't mean that it's a good thing .
<Sync time="151.610"/>
people make bad decisions all the time ,
<Sync time="153.920"/>
and even if people want to do something , that doesn't mean that it's something that's good for them .
<Sync time="158.170"/>

<Sync time="159.320"/>
our second argument is that we think this is
<Sync time="161.280"/>
exploitative of little girls .
<Sync time="163.910"/>
ultimately , there's nothing wrong with sexualizing grown women who are sexual beings and
<Sync time="169.335"/>
or have the ability to consent into this
<Sync time="171.440"/>
and understand it .
<Sync time="173.020"/>
but because cheerleading is something that's so sexualized ,
<Sync time="176.070"/>
we think it's problematic that it's so prominent for
<Sync time="178.825"/>
young women or young girls to participate in .
<Sync time="181.655"/>
many girls begin cheerleading even before middle school ,
<Sync time="185.210"/>
when they're pre-pubescent ,
<Sync time="187.240"/>
yet the
<Sync time="188.210"/>
outfits that they wear and the routines that they perform are still sexualized .
<Sync time="192.670"/>
and this only continues into
<Sync time="195.120"/>
high school or middle school ,
<Sync time="196.730"/>
when the girls are sexualized even further ,
<Sync time="199.070"/>
especially by media that often portrays them as
<Sync time="201.670"/>
the natural people for athletes to date or have sex with .
<Sync time="204.890"/>

<Sync time="205.400"/>
so we think that ultimately ,
<Sync time="206.945"/>
it's somewhat creepy and certainly exploitive to encourage little girls to go into an activity
<Sync time="212.805"/>
that sexualizes them , and treats them more as objects for the enjoyment
<Sync time="217.045"/>
of these athletes than it does as individuals .
<Sync time="219.790"/>
moreover , we don't think that these girls can positively opt into becoming cheerleaders , because they're too young
<Sync time="225.905"/>
to understand the implications of the
<Sync time="228.650"/>
sexual implications of the activity
<Sync time="230.740"/>
that they're participating in .
<Sync time="232.630"/>
so ultimately , because this is demeaning to women ,
<Sync time="235.460"/>
and because it sexualizes young girls ,
<Sync time="237.700"/>
we think that we should end cheerleading .
<Sync time="239.480"/>
thank you .
