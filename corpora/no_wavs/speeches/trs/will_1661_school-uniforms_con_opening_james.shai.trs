i'm proud to stand in opposition to the motion
<Sync time="3.050"/>
that we should abandon school uniforms .
<Sync time="6.260"/>
our first independent point
<Sync time="7.905"/>
is that school uniforms create a sense of unity and community .
<Sync time="11.535"/>
we think that particularly for younger children
<Sync time="14.670"/>
um this is extr- , but children in general ,
<Sync time="17.245"/>
that this sense of community and the sense of structure is important .
<Sync time="21.370"/>
children early in their lives
<Sync time="22.870"/>
need structure
<Sync time="23.940"/>
not just for the social benefits associated with it ,
<Sync time="27.500"/>
like being able to develop more wholly in a se- scenario in which you
<Sync time="31.235"/>
you know feel secure and feel stable ,
<Sync time="33.560"/>
but also because it's facilitative to your learning .
<Sync time="36.600"/>
that is that
<Sync time="37.350"/>
when you feel that there is a sense of structure in your life
<Sync time="40.440"/>
then you feel that you are more capable of learning , your more capable of focusing on your academics .
<Sync time="45.840"/>
we think furthermore that the sense of community created by that shared uniform
<Sync time="51.060"/>
creates an environment that is more facilitative to learning ,
<Sync time="54.270"/>
but also brings the social benefits associated with being in a community .
<Sync time="58.250"/>
that is
<Sync time="58.870"/>
closeness with individuals who have shared experiences with you .
<Sync time="62.900"/>
we think that this is particularly important because people are naturally inclined to form communities
<Sync time="68.520"/>
anyway ,
<Sync time="69.265"/>
so we think that when school uniforms create a sense of community that naturally draws people from the same school together ,
<Sync time="76.020"/>
it prevents them from prof-
<Sync time="77.780"/>
forming communities based on more arbitrary and problematic lines , like say
<Sync time="82.550"/>
race or socioeconomic status .
<Sync time="85.610"/>
at that point then
<Sync time="86.750"/>
we think that that we create communities that are
<Sync time="89.225"/>
in a sense more arbitrary ,
<Sync time="91.330"/>
less likely to be based on biases
<Sync time="93.500"/>
and more likely to be based on something that's relatively unimportant like the fact that you go to school together .
<Sync time="99.850"/>
our second independent point
<Sync time="101.910"/>
is that it signals school as a unique environment .
<Sync time="105.150"/>
what we mean by this
<Sync time="106.505"/>
is that we want school to be seen by people who go to school
<Sync time="110.460"/>
as a place would you go to learn 
<Sync time="112.120"/>
and probably not much else . we think that most socialization and things like that
<Sync time="116.480"/>
will often happen outside of the classroom .
<Sync time="119.540"/>
in the classroom , we want people to be focused on learning
<Sync time="122.760"/>
because learning is so important .
<Sync time="124.710"/>
it's a facilitative right in the sense that you are often incapable of performing your roles in a democracy without proper information ,
<Sync time="132.180"/>
and you're often incapable of getting things like
<Sync time="134.560"/>
gainful employment , and by extension the other rights that are afforded by monetary income ,
<Sync time="140.010"/>
unless you have a proper education .
<Sync time="142.295"/>
and of course a proper education is contingent upon you , you know ,
<Sync time="145.400"/>
being present in the classroom mentally and actually learning things .
<Sync time="149.185"/>
we think that if we have a uniform that actually
<Sync time="152.180"/>
associates
<Sync time="153.350"/>
you know what you're wearing essentially with where you are ,
<Sync time="157.060"/>
it creates the signal to children that
<Sync time="159.260"/>
school is not a place where you know you wear your casual clothes and you do the things that you do when you're wearing your
<Sync time="164.515"/>
casual clothes .
<Sync time="165.800"/>
we think that what someone's wearing has a very strong effect on one state of mind .
<Sync time="170.475"/>
that we p- for example behave more professionally when were wearing professional clothing ,
<Sync time="175.620"/>
regardl-
<Sync time="176.320"/>
regardless of whether or not we're in a professional environment .
<Sync time="179.630"/>
given that we think that uniforms are uniquely s- beneficial to ensuring that people associate school
<Sync time="185.965"/>
with a time of focusing on learning .
<Sync time="188.560"/>
our third and final independent point
<Sync time="190.705"/>
is that this mitigates partif- particular types of
<Sync time="193.385"/>
outfits
<Sync time="194.105"/>
that can be disruptive to that learning environment .
<Sync time="196.890"/>
so even if i myself am wearing clothing that's relatively appropriate for school ,
<Sync time="201.990"/>
we think it's quite likely that others might not be .
<Sync time="204.720"/>
um i don't want to lean into sort of like the arguments that gov talks about in terms of sexism .
<Sync time="209.740"/>
we're obviously not going to say that school uniforms should like
<Sync time="213.090"/>
enforce like these strict sexual codes .
<Sync time="215.620"/>
what we think instead is like ,
<Sync time="217.060"/>
for example , like graphic tee shirts that like depict acts of violence are like radical political positions ,
<Sync time="223.670"/>
we want to ensure that those sorts of things don't work their way into school hallways .
<Sync time="228.030"/>
not just because these can have particular harms such as like hate speech ,
<Sync time="232.285"/>
but also because we think that they're generally disruptive to the learning environment .
<Sync time="236.290"/>
that this clothing is both visually distracting
<Sync time="239.305"/>
and it separates the sense of being in school from the sense of being in a more social environment ,
<Sync time="245.050"/>
and a such we think it mitigates the ability of an individual to focus on their learning when they're in school . proud to oppose .
