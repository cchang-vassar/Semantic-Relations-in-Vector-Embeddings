<Sync time="2.070"/>
intellectual property rights are the protection of things you create for a limited amount of time .
<Sync time="7.170"/>
this includes everything from songs and catch phrases to life-saving medicines .
<Sync time="12.460"/>
the government already recognizes that intellectual property li- rights should not last forever ,
<Sync time="17.410"/>
and it already recognizes that there are caveats to intellectual property rights ,
<Sync time="21.485"/>
such as the fair use act , where if you're using something to critique it or satirize it , that would be allowed .
<Sync time="27.000"/>
ostensibly ,
<Sync time="28.630"/>
intellectual property rights are protecting economic growth
<Sync time="31.900"/>
because it's hard to keep inventing and creating if your creations can be copied .
<Sync time="35.860"/>
however ,
<Sync time="36.705"/>
we think that pretending the creations belong to any one person or corporation is absurd , and the government needs to abolish intellectual property rights
<Sync time="44.570"/>
to encourage growth and to encourage creation
<Sync time="47.085"/>
and to allow for life-saving medicines to really save lives , instead of just turn a profit for a company .
<Sync time="52.380"/>

<Sync time="53.490"/>
so first of all , we think that creations are almost always an amalgamation of work .
<Sync time="57.235"/>
we think that taylor swift might have done a lot of work for her songs
<Sync time="60.650"/>
but when we say that she owns her intellect-
<Sync time="62.940"/>
intellectual property rights over her songs ,
<Sync time="64.975"/>
we are ignoring the fact that
<Sync time="67.310"/>
hundreds of people worked on the creation
<Sync time="70.255"/>
and they are not getting fair remu- remuneration for what they have done .
<Sync time="73.750"/>
we think that it puts the spotlight on one
<Sync time="75.910"/>
specific person in an unfair way
<Sync time="78.630"/>
that ignores the fact that there are usually many more people involved in the process of creation
<Sync time="83.540"/>
than is being rewarded by the intellectual property right
<Sync time="86.990"/>
uh patents .
<Sync time="88.460"/>
we think that that's a problem that is not addressed under the current law ,
<Sync time="92.150"/>
and i- when we abolish intellectual property rights ,
<Sync time="95.380"/>
it will be more f-
<Sync time="96.220"/>
it will be more there'll be more fair recognition for the people involved intr- in
<Sync time="99.780"/>
in
<Sync time="100.270"/>
um creating
<Sync time="101.730"/>
different products .
<Sync time="103.710"/>
we also think that natural resources owned by the state are often used in creating intellectual property ,
<Sync time="109.760"/>
whether we're talking about artists who are inspired by nature
<Sync time="112.480"/>
or medical research companies that use plants and animals to test new theories
<Sync time="116.290"/>
or even grants that are given to artists and to corporations in order to uh
<Sync time="121.580"/>
to create new products and new and new material .
<Sync time="125.340"/>
we think that natural resources
<Sync time="126.840"/>
belong to the people
<Sync time="128.080"/>
of the country , and we think that it is only fair that they are also allowed to reap the benefits of it ,
<Sync time="132.670"/>
without having to pay exorbitant prices set by these companies , corporations and artists , in order to view their work or benefit from their products .
<Sync time="139.830"/>
we think it's very difficult to say
<Sync time="141.950"/>
who things really belong to ,
<Sync time="143.880"/>
um
<Sync time="144.260"/>
and allowing a narrow group to reap such huge rewards is a problem and it's wrong .
<Sync time="148.620"/>
we also think that it limits new creations by causing fear of inspiration .
<Sync time="153.590"/>
your fear ,
<Sync time="154.300"/>
your %unclear
<Sync time="154.930"/>
u- um
<Sync time="156.080"/>
corporations ,
<Sync time="157.000"/>
companies ,
<Sync time="157.890"/>
new scientists ,
<Sync time="158.910"/>
new research uh proposals
<Sync time="161.260"/>
and artists are always in fear of being
<Sync time="164.400"/>
sued by other companies or other artists ,
<Sync time="166.690"/>
and are limiting themselves in their new creations and they're limiting what they could be doing
<Sync time="171.260"/>
for fear of being sued by other companies
<Sync time="173.720"/>
uh and being told that they are copying
<Sync time="176.225"/>
uh or infringing on intellectual property rights .
<Sync time="179.340"/>
we think that this negates the problem of the
<Sync time="181.705"/>
that that it's absurd to think that there's only more growth from intellectual property rights . we think that it , in fact ,
<Sync time="186.590"/>
limits it to a great extent by causing fear in
<Sync time="189.760"/>
uh in different industries .
<Sync time="192.550"/>
um
<Sync time="193.910"/>

<Sync time="194.900"/>
and finally , we think that in many industries
<Sync time="197.760"/>
there's an even bigger problem , one of exploiting
<Sync time="200.335"/>
uh
<Sync time="200.940"/>
one of exploiting these rights to make a profit at the expense of others' lives .
<Sync time="204.670"/>
so we have a lot of life-saving medicines and other types of medicines that could alleviate pain ,
<Sync time="209.300"/>
uh p- this is particularly in the medical industry ,
<Sync time="211.715"/>
where we could be alleviating pain from people , saving lives ,
<Sync time="214.470"/>
and yet these are medicines that are marked up by hundreds of percents by companies in order for them to turn a quick profit
<Sync time="220.130"/>
before time runs out
<Sync time="221.370"/>
on their intellectual property rights uh
<Sync time="223.460"/>
and and generics and generic
<Sync time="225.860"/>
uh medicines flood the market .
<Sync time="227.830"/>
we think that lives are lost
<Sync time="229.530"/>
uh in in the pursuit of greed
<Sync time="231.640"/>
when we have intellectual property rights
<Sync time="233.680"/>
uh in the way that they are today .
<Sync time="235.380"/>
we think that this property is questionable to begin with , because we think that more people deserve recognition
<Sync time="240.695"/>
for the work that goes {in--to/into} the
<Sync time="242.925"/>
uh products and for the and the creations that are made .
<Sync time="245.700"/>
we think that in order to encourage creativity ,
<Sync time="247.720"/>
growth , and to save more lives , we should abolish intellectual property rights .
<Sync time="251.215"/>
