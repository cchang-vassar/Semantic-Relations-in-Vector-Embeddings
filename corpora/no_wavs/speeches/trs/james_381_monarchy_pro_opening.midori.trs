we should abolish the monarchy .
<Sync time="2.950"/>
so
<Sync time="3.910"/>
in this debate in order to give some clarity because obviously
<Sync time="7.210"/>
the nature of the monarchy in saudi arabia is very different from in canada ,
<Sync time="11.910"/>
we're going to focus on commonwealth countries .
<Sync time="14.520"/>
these are constitutional monarchies where
<Sync time="17.290"/>
queen elizabeth has
<Sync time="18.600"/>
some legal authority
<Sync time="20.520"/>
but in general the countries are run
<Sync time="22.550"/>
completely democratically ,
<Sync time="23.910"/>
comparably two republics like france or the united states ,
<Sync time="26.910"/>
except that the queen is the source of legal authority
<Sync time="29.550"/>
and the head of state .
<Sync time="31.450"/>
so with this in mind we have
<Sync time="33.915"/>
three main arguments .
<Sync time="35.485"/>

<Sync time="36.000"/>
the first is about the
<Sync time="38.050"/>
finances that the crown cost to maintain .
<Sync time="41.560"/>
we see that
<Sync time="42.240"/>
in britain for instance ,
<Sync time="44.270"/>
huge amounts of
<Sync time="45.715"/>
government properties are maintained for the private benefit
<Sync time="49.170"/>
of the royal family .
<Sync time="50.680"/>
palaces like balmoral up in scotland
<Sync time="53.510"/>
ultimately cost the british taxpayer
<Sync time="55.410"/>
thousands and thousands of dollars to maintain ,
<Sync time="57.670"/>
while only small parts of these cultural treasures
<Sync time="60.390"/>
are open to tourists or the general public .
<Sync time="63.210"/>
so we think that
<Sync time="64.025"/>
if the monarchy were abolished ,
<Sync time="65.865"/>
what would ultimately happen financially 
<Sync time="68.000"/>
is that we think
<Sync time="69.270"/>
certain cultural properties like balmoral or buckingham palace
<Sync time="73.000"/>
would remain property of the public , which they are right now ,
<Sync time="76.525"/>
and that
<Sync time="77.410"/>
other properties of less cultural significance which are currently
<Sync time="80.645"/>
privately held by the royal family would become their own property .
<Sync time="83.840"/>
so the royals would remain
<Sync time="85.140"/>
you know multi billionaires , they would certainly be
<Sync time="87.495"/>
very well off ,
<Sync time="88.540"/>
but the cultural heritage and the tourism money that that brings in
<Sync time="92.030"/>
would remain in the hands of the british people .
<Sync time="94.700"/>

<Sync time="95.810"/>
ultimately we think that what this means is that the british people could avoid
<Sync time="98.930"/>
subsidizing a family of billionaires while maintaining
<Sync time="101.945"/>
many of the largest benefits of the royal family ,
<Sync time="104.480"/>
namely tourism .
<Sync time="106.020"/>

<Sync time="107.550"/>
our second argument is about the signaling effect that it has to ban the monarchy .
<Sync time="112.245"/>

<Sync time="113.310"/>
we think that
<Sync time="114.020"/>
first of all the monarchy is a pretty sordid history in terms of relations
<Sync time="117.645"/>
with minority members
<Sync time="119.270"/>
of the british realm and also
<Sync time="122.060"/>
countries like canada and australia .
<Sync time="124.670"/>
we see that during the nineteenth century the monarchy worked assiduously to uphold things like british
<Sync time="130.010"/>
colonialism in india
<Sync time="131.615"/>
and that the monarchy condoned
<Sync time="133.515"/>
the mistreatment of aborigines
<Sync time="135.335"/>
and first nations peoples
<Sync time="136.990"/>
in canada .
<Sync time="138.170"/>
we think that at that point
<Sync time="140.120"/>
the monarchy's sorted reputation reflects poorly upon those countries today .
<Sync time="144.570"/>
we think that they would do better to
<Sync time="146.635"/>
create a clean break with the past
<Sync time="148.690"/>
and move forward with a republican government
<Sync time="151.465"/>
which doesn't rely for legitimacy
<Sync time="153.445"/>
on a family whose acts should render them
<Sync time="155.725"/>
completely illegitimate in the eyes of the public .
<Sync time="158.620"/>
of course ,
<Sync time="159.580"/>
queen elizabeth herself didn't do these things but we think that the fact of the matter is
<Sync time="163.380"/>
that the monarchy's legitimacy relies on this connection
<Sync time="166.140"/>
to victoria
<Sync time="167.220"/>
and her relatives 
<Sync time="168.285"/>
who did all of these terrible things during the colonial period .
<Sync time="171.710"/>

<Sync time="172.650"/>
the last argument that we'd like to make is about improving international relations .
<Sync time="177.640"/>
we think that
<Sync time="178.830"/>
the commonwealth of nations which is a sort of
<Sync time="181.645"/>
league of countries which are ruled by
<Sync time="184.055"/>
queen elizabeth ,
<Sync time="185.950"/>
ultimately does more harm than good for the countries that are members of it in some ways .
<Sync time="190.000"/>
we think that because , by its very nature , the commonwealth excludes countries
<Sync time="194.175"/>
like the united states ,
<Sync time="195.700"/>
like india , which have a lot in common
<Sync time="197.870"/>
culturally with the current commonwealth members
<Sync time="200.300"/>
but who don't have
<Sync time="201.510"/>
a monarchy ,
<Sync time="202.425"/>
that ultimately the commonwealth
<Sync time="204.140"/>
creates more barriers than benefits .
<Sync time="206.480"/>
we think that
<Sync time="207.200"/>
in a world without the commonwealth that countries like britain and canada
<Sync time="210.955"/>
would be more likely to pursue
<Sync time="212.680"/>
closer trade relationships with india
<Sync time="214.775"/>
and the united states , which ultimately would be
<Sync time="217.105"/>
economically and culturally beneficial
<Sync time="219.430"/>
for those countries .
<Sync time="220.685"/>
we think that right now the existence of the monarchy
<Sync time="223.900"/>
may not be the greatest barrier to cooperation
<Sync time="226.420"/>
but that the commonwealth that she creates because she is the head of state of so many countries ,
<Sync time="230.960"/>
ultimately is not a beneficial community
<Sync time="233.240"/>
for its members . that they would be better off pursuing
<Sync time="235.710"/>
other more organic connections based on current interests
<Sync time="238.890"/>
rather than on a shared
<Sync time="240.315"/>
legacy of rule by the windsor family .
<Sync time="242.595"/>
for these reasons we should abolish the monarchy .
<Sync time="245.200"/>
thank you .
