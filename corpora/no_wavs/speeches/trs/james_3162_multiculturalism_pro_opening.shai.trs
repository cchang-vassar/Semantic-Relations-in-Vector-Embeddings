we should adopt
<Sync time="2.080"/>
multiculturalism .
<Sync time="3.940"/>
so by that we mean that we think that
<Sync time="6.405"/>
the practice of
<Sync time="7.695"/>
having multiple cultures exist alongside each other in a pluralistic fashion 
<Sync time="12.435"/>
in a country , is preferable to trying to seek to integrate everybody
<Sync time="16.535"/>
into one monolithic culture .
<Sync time="19.120"/>
so we think that basically the comparison here is between the idea of a melting pot ,
<Sync time="24.315"/>
where everyone blends together into one culture ,
<Sync time="26.540"/>
and a salad , where all of the distinct
<Sync time="28.675"/>
components remain recognizable .
<Sync time="31.060"/>
three arguments :
<Sync time="32.600"/>
first ,
<Sync time="33.365"/>
we thinks it
<Sync time="34.170"/>
ultimately multiculturalism leads to more immigrants coming to your country
<Sync time="38.370"/>
which makes your country
<Sync time="39.535"/>
more competitive economically .
<Sync time="41.685"/>
we see , for instance , that people are more likely to immigrate to countries which are more tolerant .
<Sync time="46.740"/>
this is why places like canada
<Sync time="48.550"/>
actually have a higher rate of immigration than the united states .
<Sync time="52.010"/>
we think that when people feel that they can go to a new country
<Sync time="54.775"/>
and be more accepted for their culture , and not have to worry about
<Sync time="57.830"/>
integrating into the dominant culture ,
<Sync time="59.890"/>
that they're more likely to choose to move to that country .
<Sync time="62.640"/>
you know , imagine that you're a sikh doctor in india and you want to move to the west .
<Sync time="67.770"/>
would you choose to go to a country where you're going to have to give up your religion and your traditional practices
<Sync time="72.680"/>
in order to fit in ,
<Sync time="73.930"/>
or a country where you can continue
<Sync time="75.920"/>
any of those practices that are important to you , or that you like , and you'll still be accepted ?
<Sync time="80.760"/>
we think it's obvious that you would pick the second one given the choice .
<Sync time="84.380"/>
at that point we think that you're more likely to bring in
<Sync time="86.850"/>
immigrants and highly qualified workers from other countries .
<Sync time="90.330"/>
why is this such a boon ?
<Sync time="91.655"/>
one reason why countries like canada , the u_s and australia
<Sync time="95.495"/>
are so much wealthier than the rest of the world is that they have
<Sync time="98.300"/>
brain gain and other countries have brain drain .
<Sync time="101.660"/>
many of the best and brightest in countries like india or pakistan
<Sync time="105.270"/>
choose to leave those countries and come to the u_s , canada , australia .
<Sync time="109.210"/>
we think that this makes the countries that receive these immigrants
<Sync time="112.190"/>
more competitive , because they have
<Sync time="113.960"/>
uh you know better doctors , better engineers , better professors , at the expense of every other country .
<Sync time="119.120"/>
so all countries should seek to have
<Sync time="120.990"/>
this big draw factor
<Sync time="122.580"/>
for immigrants in order to increase their own e- economic competition on a global scale .
<Sync time="128.270"/>
or competitiveness i should say .
<Sync time="130.125"/>
our second argument is about promoting tolerance .
<Sync time="133.105"/>
we think that when there is a norm that everyone has to assimilate to your culture when they moved to your country ,
<Sync time="138.980"/>
that this makes it easier for people to be intolerant .
<Sync time="141.860"/>
if they see someone who's a little bit different , or who's sticking out ,
<Sync time="144.830"/>
then they think that person needs to change to become more like me .
<Sync time="148.680"/>
that's the melting pot model .
<Sync time="150.490"/>
but when people experience multiculturalism , we think it's more likely that they're willing to accept others for who they are ,
<Sync time="156.080"/>
to tolerate small differences and to try to learn to empathize
<Sync time="159.485"/>
with other people .
<Sync time="160.950"/>
a huge driver of racism
<Sync time="163.160"/>
and religious discrimination and things like that
<Sync time="165.550"/>
is the empathy gap between people of different backgrounds .
<Sync time="168.900"/>
but we think that if you live with the idea that it's okay for people to be different , then it's easier to bridge that empathy gap ,
<Sync time="175.090"/>
versus if you live in a country
<Sync time="176.845"/>
where it's not acceptable for people to be outside of the mainstream culture .
<Sync time="182.240"/>
our third and final argument is that we think that a better national culture emerges as a result of multiculturalism .
<Sync time="189.340"/>
because recognize that if you have one culture that everyone has to assimilate to
<Sync time="193.955"/>
then ultimately you're going to have a harmful norms
<Sync time="196.720"/>
internalized into that mainstream culture .
<Sync time="199.410"/>
people who immigrated in previous waves of immigration are likely to look down on current immigrants for instance .
<Sync time="205.205"/>
we see this in america .
<Sync time="206.750"/>
many people who are
<Sync time="207.740"/>
third generation americans look down on people who are first generation americans
<Sync time="211.830"/>
even though their grandparents or great grandparents work from this country ,
<Sync time="215.305"/>
and that's because they think : " look ,
<Sync time="217.005"/>
we italians or germans or whoever integrated .
<Sync time="220.240"/>
why can't people from latin america do it in the same way ? "
<Sync time="223.680"/>
we think that when you have multiculturalism you end up with a national culture
<Sync time="227.700"/>
that's more focused on
<Sync time="229.065"/>
tolerance and accepting others , that's more willing to adopt things that are good
<Sync time="233.050"/>
from the immigrant cultures ,
<Sync time="234.410"/>
and more willing to engage in self criticism about what is bad
<Sync time="237.740"/>
in the existing culture .
<Sync time="239.215"/>
so for these reasons we should adopt multiculturalism .
<Sync time="242.490"/>
thank you .
<Sync time="243.250"/>
