the motion for today's debate is that we should abolish double jeopardy .
<Sync time="4.240"/>
two main areas of clash , the first on the nature of our system of justice .
<Sync time="8.310"/>
we think that
<Sync time="9.480"/>
a crime doesn't change , just because time has passed .
<Sync time="12.660"/>
if i murdered someone fifty years ago ,
<Sync time="14.560"/>
they are still murdered
<Sync time="15.800"/>
now , and the law remains the same ,
<Sync time="17.965"/>
and the victim was still harmed , and the person is still dead .
<Sync time="21.560"/>
we think that at the point , that new evidence comes out ,
<Sync time="24.280"/>
maybe the jury was stacked , and we have reason to believe that there was an unfair
<Sync time="28.130"/>
acquittal ,
<Sync time="28.880"/>
maybe there was a confession , or even the hundreds of years of new technology that we have acquired 
<Sync time="33.850"/>
allows us to do things like d_n_a testing ,
<Sync time="36.125"/>
and blood testing .
<Sync time="38.080"/>
we think there- that the justice system needs to represent a need to adjust , to maintain what the original spirit is .
<Sync time="44.390"/>
we think we have to acknowledge , that sometimes the trial system
<Sync time="47.810"/>
is imperfect ,
<Sync time="48.925"/>
and the only way to solve this
<Sync time="50.665"/>
is by allowing something like double jeopardy 
<Sync time="53.100"/>
to solve for these situations .
<Sync time="54.815"/>
because currently , the problem is that people ,
<Sync time="57.480"/>
after getting acquitted once , and just setting up the right system of circumstances ,
<Sync time="61.740"/>
hiring an expensive enough lawyer ,
<Sync time="64.420"/>
any of these kinds of things . like ,
<Sync time="66.030"/>
silencing enough witnesses
<Sync time="67.840"/>
means they get away scot free .
<Sync time="70.080"/>
we think it is always a larger rights violation , to let someone go free
<Sync time="74.005"/>
than to put someone who is innocent
<Sync time="76.550"/>
through the trial process twice ,
<Sync time="78.280"/>
because , in the end , if you are innocent ,
<Sync time="80.290"/>
you are likely to be found so twice .
<Sync time="82.125"/>
but , if you are guilty ,
<Sync time="83.620"/>
you get to go free
<Sync time="84.750"/>
all forever
<Sync time="85.790"/>
after you're tri-
<Sync time="86.720"/>
after you're tried once , 
<Sync time="87.950"/>
under double jeopardy .
<Sync time="89.410"/>
we think the
<Sync time="90.440"/>
impact of this is that ,
<Sync time="91.955"/>
if you- if our justice system cannot be trusted , or is inconsistent ,
<Sync time="96.025"/>
or allows people who are guilty to go free , due to things like the lack of double jeopardy ,
<Sync time="100.200"/>
we think people are okay with flaunting the law ,
<Sync time="102.770"/>
and losing trust in the system .
<Sync time="104.600"/>
things like o_j simpson
<Sync time="106.370"/>
getting away without any punishment ,
<Sync time="108.295"/>
and then writing the book , if i did it , describing the crime and being like : yeah , i totally did it ,
<Sync time="113.340"/>
are exactly the problem with our current society .
<Sync time="116.130"/>
criminals are okay with
<Sync time="118.030"/>
afterwards
<Sync time="119.160"/>
basically yelling to the world :
<Sync time="120.770"/>
look at the crime that i've committed , because they know they cannot answer it .
<Sync time="124.135"/>
we think this decreases the general public's trust in the system ,
<Sync time="127.390"/>
and decreases the efficiency overall .
<Sync time="129.820"/>
our secondary of clash
<Sync time="131.645"/>
has to do with victims' rights .
<Sync time="133.365"/>
because we think that when we're evaluating the justice system , we're working in a system of rights violations ,
<Sync time="138.415"/>
and trying to compromise
<Sync time="139.900"/>
on who gets to be justified where .
<Sync time="142.170"/>
and we think , the most important person in these situations is often the victim ,
<Sync time="145.935"/>
because if someone has perpetrated again-
<Sync time="147.830"/>
something against a victim ,
<Sync time="149.180"/>
they have
<Sync time="149.675"/>
violated their rights , and now owes a debt to them ,
<Sync time="152.985"/>
and we think- because of what has been taken to
<Sync time="155.110"/>
them .
<Sync time="155.515"/>
we think
<Sync time="156.165"/>
that a violation to-
<Sync time="157.765"/>
we have to- we think that it is important
<Sync time="159.740"/>
to be certain that that um ,
<Sync time="162.495"/>
that you are like- that the person , who you're letting go ,
<Sync time="165.370"/>
is truly innocent ,
<Sync time="166.730"/>
in order to fulfill your obligation to the victim
<Sync time="169.150"/>
and their rights .
<Sync time="170.570"/>
we think , more than this though , that it is unlikely to be a system that is abused .
<Sync time="174.790"/>
we think oftentimes resources are limited ,
<Sync time="177.510"/>
and retrying the same person ,
<Sync time="179.190"/>
over and over ,
<Sync time="180.470"/>
is not only taxing to all those involved ,
<Sync time="183.390"/>
but also incredibly monetarily consuming ,
<Sync time="185.975"/>
and we just don't think that state {legisla--latures/legislatures}
<Sync time="187.920"/>
have that ability .
<Sync time="189.600"/>
like ,
<Sync time="189.955"/>
even if
<Sync time="190.645"/>
someone is incredibly racist ,
<Sync time="192.370"/>
if they don't have the funds to amplify that racism ,
<Sync time="195.090"/>
they're not going to retry the same person
<Sync time="197.230"/>
seventy million times .
<Sync time="198.705"/>
more than this , we don't think that victims are going to push for this
<Sync time="201.870"/>
either . at the point that someone has been found innocent
<Sync time="204.750"/>
once or twice ,
<Sync time="205.900"/>
either they run out of money ,
<Sync time="207.285"/>
or they ran out of the energy to do so .
<Sync time="209.830"/>
we think it is important to recognize
<Sync time="211.945"/>
that , if a victim once closure ,
<Sync time="213.960"/>
a second acquittal will oftentimes be enough .
<Sync time="216.330"/>
but the problem , with allowing someone
<Sync time="218.690"/>
to
<Sync time="219.080"/>
not have to enter that second process in the first place ,
<Sync time="222.330"/>
is that you are
<Sync time="223.185"/>
lacking the potentiality of closure
<Sync time="225.530"/>
at
<Sync time="226.050"/>
all .
<Sync time="226.800"/>
we always think that the larger rights violation is on the side of having double jeopardy , we think that the only people who it protects are those who are guilty ,
<Sync time="235.515"/>
and therefore it ought be abolished . for these reasons proud to propose .
<Sync time="239.320"/>
