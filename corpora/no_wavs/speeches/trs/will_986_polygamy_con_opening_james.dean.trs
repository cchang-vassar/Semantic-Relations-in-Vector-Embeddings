i'm proud to oppose the motion that we should legalize polygamy .
<Sync time="4.160"/>
our first independent point is that we think that
<Sync time="7.100"/>
um the nuclear family is not only preferable for society at large
<Sync time="12.460"/>
but also this traditional construct of a two parent nuclear family
<Sync time="16.275"/>
is better for kids .
<Sync time="17.850"/>
so first on society
<Sync time="19.510"/>
um or actually first on kids .
<Sync time="21.290"/>
we think that largely um the you know the structures that come from
<Sync time="25.450"/>
raising a child
<Sync time="26.830"/>
are largely based on one ,
<Sync time="29.110"/>
having sort of like
<Sync time="30.350"/>
positive role models that you spend a significant portion of your time with
<Sync time="34.320"/>
but
<Sync time="34.745"/>
b ,
<Sync time="35.360"/>
having clear delineations and who cares for children .
<Sync time="38.870"/>
we think that both of these are significantly more complicated in a polygamous marriage
<Sync time="43.440"/>
because you believe that
<Sync time="44.645"/>
at the end of the day .
<Sync time="45.940"/>
um you know this is something that
<Sync time="48.035"/>
a ,
<Sync time="48.745"/>
your
<Sync time="49.195"/>
kid is going to have less time with each individual parent
<Sync time="52.265"/>
when
<Sync time="52.790"/>
their time is essentially being spread out more ,
<Sync time="55.750"/>
but also we believe that making those delineations on who spends time with the kid
<Sync time="60.495"/>
is going to be more complicated with a large set of parents .
<Sync time="64.040"/>
that in turn creates the problem of you know
<Sync time="66.780"/>
essentially um
<Sync time="68.520"/>
you know having your parents and
<Sync time="70.985"/>
you know have these arguments over who take care
<Sync time="73.220"/>
takes care of you when .
<Sync time="74.390"/>
and of course this happens in two parent structures
<Sync time="77.000"/>
but we think it's inherently more problematic when there's like more people
<Sync time="80.810"/>
which enables more buck passing on responsibility .
<Sync time="83.930"/>
so this really isn't like a
<Sync time="85.145"/>
good environment to raise a child in .
<Sync time="87.545"/>
but we think that the societal norms stem from the fact that just generally its proliferation which will happen through legalization , we'll get to that moment .
<Sync time="95.930"/>
but um we think that that proliferation then
<Sync time="98.570"/>
sort of normalizes it in society in a way that exposes you know more kids to it and as such uh increases the magnitude of harm .
<Sync time="106.620"/>
our second independent point is that
<Sync time="108.550"/>
we think the polygamy decreases barriers
<Sync time="111.335"/>
to the abusive marriage as an institution .
<Sync time="114.510"/>
so one hypothetical example of this is
<Sync time="116.790"/>
say like
<Sync time="117.550"/>
a group of mobsters
<Sync time="119.125"/>
who want to avoid testifying against one another ,
<Sync time="122.510"/>
so as such they just like enter a polygamous marriage and as such don't have to testify
<Sync time="128.230"/>
um because they have spousal privilege .
<Sync time="130.380"/>
the reason this doesn't happen in the status quo is because you're only allowed to marry one person at a time ,
<Sync time="135.720"/>
so if they're all in their own marriages
<Sync time="138.050"/>
then like you can't do that .
<Sync time="140.250"/>
but
<Sync time="141.325"/>
if they um
<Sync time="142.620"/>
you know if you have polygamous marriages
<Sync time="144.810"/>
people can essentially enter and leave marriages as they choose and as they feel free to .
<Sync time="149.290"/>
so this creates then a
<Sync time="150.450"/>
significantly lower barrier
<Sync time="152.290"/>
to abusing the legal privileges asso-
<Sync time="154.775"/>
um
<Sync time="155.300"/>
associated with marriage ,
<Sync time="156.950"/>
and as such means that people can you know essentially flop the law and do other you know problematic things like
<Sync time="162.145"/>
like say taxes for example
<Sync time="164.240"/>
um
<Sync time="164.810"/>
by you know entering a marriage with one another .
<Sync time="168.590"/>
our third and uh final independent point is just the abuses that are associated with polygamy .
<Sync time="174.430"/>
so we think that wh-
<Sync time="175.840"/>
um but obviously like the big highlighted example is sort of these like more conservative religious groups that often
<Sync time="182.850"/>
um
<Sync time="183.410"/>
have a lot of like spousal abuse in polygamous relationships .
<Sync time="186.955"/>
we think that the proliferation of uh
<Sync time="189.785"/>
polygamous relationships will outweigh the legal protections discussed by side government ,
<Sync time="194.590"/>
so that is to say that
<Sync time="196.135"/>
even if it is easier to be
<Sync time="198.210"/>
report reviews in each individual polygamous relationship ,
<Sync time="201.780"/>
the fact that there will be more polygamous relationships means that on net
<Sync time="205.480"/>
there will be more suffering .
<Sync time="206.925"/>
we think that the reason why there will be an increase is you know a very simple essentially just that
<Sync time="211.520"/>
in the status quo even if this is something you're doing behind closed doors
<Sync time="215.150"/>
there is a risk of penalty that disincentivizes people from doing it .
<Sync time="219.370"/>
there's also a social stigma associated with it that reduces the amount of marriages ,
<Sync time="223.800"/>
but we think that both of these go away when you have that government stamp of approval .
<Sync time="228.780"/>
but secondly we think that the
<Sync time="230.130"/>
abuse associated with polygamy is inherent sexism ,
<Sync time="232.980"/>
that this is
<Sync time="233.585"/>
almost always going to be um one man and several women and we think that the presence of this type of marriage and its proliferation in the public eye
<Sync time="242.290"/>
reifies the notion that women are here simply property of men
<Sync time="245.955"/>
and that itself as a societal norm is inherently problematic . proud to oppose .
<Sync time="251.211"/>
