we should introduce
<Sync time="1.370"/>
compulsory voting , because
<Sync time="3.505"/>
turnout is one of the absolute most important things in a democratic society  ,
<Sync time="8.660"/>
and , i think compulsory voting is going to increase turnout .
<Sync time="11.810"/>
so , let's start by talking about the problem of
<Sync time="14.350"/>
turnout . one of the biggest problems plaguing
<Sync time="16.590"/>
a lot of democratic societies is a lack of
<Sync time="19.300"/>
participation .
<Sync time="20.205"/>
so , when you look at a place like the united states , you can only more or less expect like fifty to sixty percent of
<Sync time="26.310"/>
people
<Sync time="26.935"/>
uh participating , i believe , in most electio- uh
<Sync time="30.015"/>
in a presidential election .
<Sync time="31.875"/>
in mid term elections , or local elections , numbers are often even lower , and a whole lot of people
<Sync time="37.205"/>
aren't participating .
<Sync time="39.120"/>
um and additionally , uh in a lot of countries around the world uh ,
<Sync time="42.650"/>
this is a similar problem , like i believe
<Sync time="44.910"/>
participation in the the u_k um
<Sync time="47.530"/>
prime minister election that
<Sync time="48.610"/>
took place a couple of days ago ,
<Sync time="50.140"/>
i believe uh participation hovered in , like , somewhere in the sixties ,
<Sync time="54.240"/>
um and it historically high turnout .
<Sync time="56.300"/>
so , the problem with this is , that when you have numbers like that , you're a democracy , but
<Sync time="61.125"/>
it seems like um
<Sync time="62.535"/>
a huge portion , like millions of people , aren't participating in the process .
<Sync time="67.310"/>
and ,
<Sync time="67.950"/>
even if they're not participating in the process ,
<Sync time="70.450"/>
in order for the state to be just ,
<Sync time="72.250"/>
it still has to obey the will of the people ,
<Sync time="75.120"/>
and it's therefore
<Sync time="76.480"/>
important to make sure that , it's um
<Sync time="78.920"/>
as
<Sync time="79.260"/>
easy for people to participate as possible .
<Sync time="82.015"/>
i think compulsory voting
<Sync time="83.920"/>
makes it um
<Sync time="84.705"/>
more likely that people are going to participate , in two ways .
<Sync time="87.680"/>
first and foremost , people don't want to get
<Sync time="90.240"/>
fined , people don't want to
<Sync time="91.585"/>
face the possibility of minor levels of punishment ,
<Sync time="94.910"/>
um and people just like don't want to deal with that .
<Sync time="97.850"/>
so , people are probably going to vote to avoid that .
<Sync time="100.450"/>
but moreover , when voting is seen as something that is , like , your civic duty , rather than something as that you're obligated to do ,
<Sync time="108.280"/>
it gives people more latitude
<Sync time="110.540"/>
to uh suppress votes in some ways ,
<Sync time="113.450"/>
so- , um
<Sync time="114.500"/>
the- in line with political incentives . so , when you look at places like america ,
<Sync time="119.030"/>
it's easier to have your elections
<Sync time="120.910"/>
on a work day , where it's hard for some people to get off from work , uh
<Sync time="124.370"/>
and it could be more inaccessible ,
<Sync time="126.400"/>
it's easier to make it more difficult for people to vote by mail or electronically ,
<Sync time="131.050"/>
um
<Sync time="131.705"/>
uh it's
<Sync time="132.545"/>
easier to make it so that people can't vote , by like exclusionary voter i_d practices ,
<Sync time="137.935"/>
it's easier to put um
<Sync time="139.840"/>
elections all on different days , at different times , to make it harder for people to vote ,
<Sync time="144.630"/>
but when you make com-
<Sync time="145.940"/>
voting compulsory ,
<Sync time="147.345"/>
uh and people face the possibility of getting punished for not voting ,
<Sync time="151.300"/>
i think that there's going to be a whole lot of pressure to make sure that , if people have
<Sync time="155.505"/>
to vote ,
<Sync time="156.400"/>
then
<Sync time="157.045"/>
in- voting is much more accessible to people .
<Sync time="159.535"/>
and , i think that that's absolutely great for political participation ,
<Sync time="163.790"/>
and i think that the result of this is that more people are going to participate ,
<Sync time="167.030"/>
and you're going to see spikes in turnout .
<Sync time="168.930"/>
that's huge ,
<Sync time="170.520"/>
because it means that the state is more representative .
<Sync time="173.110"/>
policy is going to be more representative to the
<Sync time="175.110"/>
politicians ,
<Sync time="176.080"/>
politicians can act more powerfully and decisively , because they have a stronger mandate of the people ,
<Sync time="181.630"/>
and there's not like this like
<Sync time="183.310"/>
possibility of like , well ,
<Sync time="185.020"/>
half the people didn't participate , and a couple of thousand votes in one or two areas can swing the entire election .
<Sync time="191.300"/>
you're gonna have much more of a possibility of , like , what the
<Sync time="193.855"/>
what people actually want .
<Sync time="195.760"/>
so , for all those reasons , compulsory voting
<Sync time="198.295"/>
should be introduced .
<Sync time="199.430"/>
