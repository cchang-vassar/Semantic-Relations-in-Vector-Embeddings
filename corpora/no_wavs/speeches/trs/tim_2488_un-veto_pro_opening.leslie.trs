we should abolish the united nations
<Sync time="2.735"/>
security council
<Sync time="4.160"/>
veto power . so in the status quo , the united nations
<Sync time="6.955"/>
has five members of the security council that are permanent
<Sync time="10.305"/>
and have veto power . the rest of the members
<Sync time="12.470"/>
alternate on
<Sync time="13.950"/>
um i believe yearly basis , but they
<Sync time="16.140"/>
they rotate
<Sync time="17.110"/>
amongst people or
<Sync time="18.535"/>
member states of the u_n , aside
<Sync time="20.215"/>
from the united states ,
<Sync time="21.620"/>
uh russia ,
<Sync time="23.305"/>
uh great britain , china
<Sync time="25.500"/>
and france .
<Sync time="26.820"/>
these are the four nations that have veto power on the u_n security council .
<Sync time="29.990"/>
we think that we should take away that veto power
<Sync time="31.960"/>
from those nations and instead ,
<Sync time="33.760"/>
should institute a system in which two thirds uh
<Sync time="36.300"/>
two thirds vote by the security council
<Sync time="38.890"/>
uh would allow for
<Sync time="40.625"/>
uh action to be taken , military action or intervention to be taken
<Sync time="44.195"/>
by the security council . this would also allow them
<Sync time="46.650"/>
to send cases to the i_c_c .
<Sync time="48.755"/>
in the status quo ,
<Sync time="50.180"/>
again ,
<Sync time="50.720"/>
this needs to get past a ve- uh
<Sync time="52.020"/>
get get past a veto ,
<Sync time="54.240"/>
which we don't think should be the case anymore .
<Sync time="56.000"/>
so , why do we think that this is necessary ?
<Sync time="58.500"/>
we think that the security council
<Sync time="60.435"/>
is entirely marred by inactivity
<Sync time="62.950"/>
and inaction in the status quo , and the reason for that
<Sync time="65.395"/>
is that political interests ,
<Sync time="67.120"/>
specifically from china , russia and the united states ,
<Sync time="70.550"/>
prevet-
<Sync time="71.410"/>
prevent action in these instances ,
<Sync time="74.140"/>
because they have vested interests
<Sync time="75.675"/>
in maintaining their sphere of influence
<Sync time="77.770"/>
and control over specific reasons for- regions . for example ,
<Sync time="81.620"/>
syria is something that simply cannot be acted on by the united nations
<Sync time="85.100"/>
because russia has vested oil interests
<Sync time="87.655"/>
and other types of interests
<Sync time="89.040"/>
in the assad regime .
<Sync time="90.800"/>
uh also in the case of places like north korea , china refuses
<Sync time="94.100"/>
to allow the united nations
<Sync time="95.645"/>
to intervene . they would never allow some sort
<Sync time="97.870"/>
of referenda
<Sync time="98.825"/>
to pass the security council , and
<Sync time="100.270"/>
we think that this goes against the purpose of the u_n .
<Sync time="102.720"/>
the u_n is meant ter- is meant to foster global cooperation
<Sync time="105.815"/>
between powers both large and small .
<Sync time="107.990"/>
we think there's there's that there's a long history
<Sync time="110.545"/>
of api-
<Sync time="111.190"/>
of imperial oppression ,
<Sync time="112.500"/>
and the u_n existed to try and solve for that , to ensure that there was some sort of equal-
<Sync time="116.590"/>
equalizing of the playing field
<Sync time="118.520"/>
in international relations .
<Sync time="120.400"/>
the u_n places power
<Sync time="121.830"/>
disproportionately through the security council
<Sync time="124.260"/>
in imperial interests , which means that in the instances
<Sync time="127.070"/>
in which these major superpowers in the world
<Sync time="130.110"/>
align in their interests
<Sync time="131.530"/>
and choose to go after small nations ,
<Sync time="133.590"/>
these are oftentimes nations that are the least protected
<Sync time="136.180"/>
and already the ones
<Sync time="137.310"/>
that are most harmed by former imperial
<Sync time="139.450"/>
uh interaction .
<Sync time="140.800"/>
we also think
<Sync time="141.635"/>
that if you ever want to be able to go after powerful states to enforce the regulations on things like human rights
<Sync time="147.710"/>
and other things that the u_n
<Sync time="149.170"/>
exists to foster ,
<Sync time="150.610"/>
things like
<Sync time="151.300"/>
protecting geneva convention rights and {protectioning/protecting}
<Sync time="154.210"/>
innate human rights
<Sync time="155.700"/>
through referenda and treaties that exist between states , we think the
<Sync time="158.700"/>
only way you can ever get that type of protection , especially on large states
<Sync time="162.080"/>
like china or russia , is to remove
<Sync time="164.235"/>
the veto power that they currently have .
<Sync time="166.450"/>
we think that in practice ,
<Sync time="167.700"/>
this has been
<Sync time="168.475"/>
a horrible system that protects despots like those in syria and north korea .
<Sync time="172.330"/>
it protects superpowers that
<Sync time="173.940"/>
uh systemically
<Sync time="175.800"/>
abuse human rights , whether it's
<Sync time="177.545"/>
individuals that are gay in russia or individuals who are minority and black
<Sync time="181.775"/>
in the united states . we think that
<Sync time="183.530"/>
no action can ever be taken against these superpowers
<Sync time="186.590"/>
by an international body , by the body
<Sync time="188.950"/>
that is supposed to regulate
<Sync time="190.530"/>
these human rights abuses , that is the u_n ,
<Sync time="192.985"/>
if these countries maintain their veto power .
<Sync time="195.880"/>
we think force would be more likely in those situations .
<Sync time="198.940"/>
even in those instances where a few interests contradict , we think
<Sync time="202.405"/>
that
<Sync time="202.870"/>
even if you're not going to be able to go out
<Sync time="204.550"/>
against the united states or china anytime soon ,
<Sync time="207.080"/>
it's still preferable to have u_n resolutions
<Sync time="209.415"/>
that ensure that the violence that is currently being done
<Sync time="212.400"/>
in places like north korea and syria ,
<Sync time="214.820"/>
instances in which lives are daily
<Sync time="217.115"/>
on the line ,
<Sync time="218.140"/>
we think that these are instances in which the u_n has an obligation to act ,
<Sync time="221.665"/>
and the current system doesn't allow for that possibility .
<Sync time="224.600"/>
and for these reasons , we should abolish the united nations security council veto power .
<Sync time="229.285"/>
