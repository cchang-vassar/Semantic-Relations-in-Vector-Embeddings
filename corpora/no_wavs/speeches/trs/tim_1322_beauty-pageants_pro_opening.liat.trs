we should ban beauty contests .
<Sync time="2.910"/>
we think that , in the status quo ,
<Sync time="4.480"/>
beauty contests are largely used to
<Sync time="6.700"/>
allow women to be viewed
<Sync time="8.110"/>
through a male gaze ,
<Sync time="9.010"/>
in which largely male panels
<Sync time="10.990"/>
and patriarchal ideas of
<Sync time="12.470"/>
beauty
<Sync time="13.010"/>
are enforced upon women , and
<Sync time="14.360"/>
awards are given to them
<Sync time="15.560"/>
for how well they can
<Sync time="16.805"/>
ascribe to those patriarchal ideas . we think that this is a vastly
<Sync time="20.410"/>
outdated notion ,
<Sync time="21.620"/>
and that beauty contests
<Sync time="22.810"/>
only exist to perpetuate these notions , with very little gain for the pageant entry
<Sync time="27.365"/>
uh individuals themselves . so , that's what we're going to talk about
<Sync time="30.690"/>
in this speech , about how beauty contests set bad norms ,
<Sync time="33.175"/>
and about why this is a
<Sync time="34.700"/>
a justification for a ban .
<Sync time="36.175"/>
so , why does it set that norms ?
<Sync time="38.500"/>
we think in practice , people are rewarded
<Sync time="40.950"/>
largely for traditional beauty standards . when you view something like the miss america pageant or the miss universe pageant ,
<Sync time="46.400"/>
they have sections in which people are supposed to give speeches about things they're passionate about ,
<Sync time="50.565"/>
or the things that %hes show off talents that they have .
<Sync time="53.370"/>
but when you see these things , you recognize that
<Sync time="55.580"/>
these women are largely not judged based on all of those
<Sync time="58.510"/>
possibilities . look at
<Sync time="59.880"/>
president donald trump who had a stake in miss america	
<Sync time="62.325"/>
and miss universe ,
<Sync time="63.530"/>
as an individual who enforced those ideas of p-
<Sync time="66.195"/>
those patriarchal notions
<Sync time="67.810"/>
of beauty in a woman , and
<Sync time="69.250"/>
views those things as largely credible as a means of judging women ,
<Sync time="72.660"/>
and did so in these pageants .
<Sync time="74.560"/>
we think that given that this is the case , it's overtly
<Sync time="76.960"/>
clear
<Sync time="77.820"/>
that the vast majority of judgment that takes place in this
<Sync time="80.640"/>
is almost solely on the looks of women .
<Sync time="82.690"/>
we think this reinforces the idea
<Sync time="85.195"/>
of women being objectified , that
<Sync time="87.120"/>
women can be distilled into the idea of an object that you view
<Sync time="90.800"/>
as beautiful or not beautiful , and which you can award
<Sync time="93.480"/>
as you would award any other painting or art work .
<Sync time="96.075"/>
we think that this dehumanizes the women
<Sync time="98.275"/>
and we actually think it creates
<Sync time="99.570"/>
immense amounts of trauma for the people that participate in these things ,
<Sync time="102.740"/>
and additionally increases social pressure .
<Sync time="105.090"/>
we recognize that
<Sync time="106.050"/>
beauty standards aren't created by beauty contests ,
<Sync time="109.140"/>
but they do serve
<Sync time="110.140"/>
as a major force for enforcing those things with very little gain for the women that compete in these things , maybe they earn
<Sync time="116.020"/>
so maybe one or two women are able to earn enough money
<Sync time="118.900"/>
to survive for a long period of time , but this does not weigh the fact
<Sync time="122.235"/>
that
<Sync time="122.950"/>
little girls and people that are growing up , impressionable young women 
<Sync time="126.315"/>
are learning about what they need to look like , what they need to do ,
<Sync time="129.240"/>
how their bodies need to look ,
<Sync time="130.735"/>
when they view these beauty contests . and we think that these enforce
<Sync time="133.740"/>
incredibly unhealthy
<Sync time="135.190"/>
standards , both physically unhealthy and mentally unhealthy , for these girls ,
<Sync time="138.870"/>
and we simply don't think it is worth the risk . we think
<Sync time="141.650"/>
when you re- it also reproduces the practice
<Sync time="144.240"/>
of women being judged through the male gaze .
<Sync time="146.500"/>
a practice
<Sync time="147.240"/>
that has been perpetuated throughout
<Sync time="148.960"/>
all of human history .
<Sync time="150.750"/>
we think that as an enlightened and modern society ,
<Sync time="153.195"/>
we should move past into a society in which women don't need to go to men for their type
<Sync time="158.180"/>
of %hes for t-
<Sync time="159.145"/>
they don't have to go to men
<Sync time="160.220"/>
for approval , but rather can get that approval internally , can
<Sync time="163.400"/>
justify their existence
<Sync time="164.890"/>
based on things other than their appearance . so why do we think that these arguments
<Sync time="168.900"/>
are enough to justify a ban ?
<Sync time="170.670"/>
well , we think that bans are acceptable
<Sync time="172.800"/>
when there are large social externalities , and what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="176.460"/>
the government is justified in intervening
<Sync time="178.890"/>
to ban any sort of products
<Sync time="180.775"/>
or practice or these types of things ,
<Sync time="182.730"/>
when
<Sync time="183.150"/>
the practices
<Sync time="184.350"/>
of that type of thing that is being banned
<Sync time="186.690"/>
extend beyond those
<Sync time="188.425"/>
that are able to consent
<Sync time="189.750"/>
into the 
<Sync time="190.295"/>
impacts . and what we mean by this is that
<Sync time="192.135"/>
women , young girls , are not able to consent to the harms , the psychological harms
<Sync time="196.780"/>
that come from beauty contests .
<Sync time="198.300"/>
well ,
<Sync time="198.730"/>
contestants themselves may be able to consent to any of
<Sync time="201.050"/>
these things . the fact that these things
<Sync time="202.990"/>
inevitably influence people
<Sync time="204.925"/>
on a subconscious and unconscious level
<Sync time="207.150"/>
is something that the pe-
<Sync time="207.915"/>
that these people cannot consent into , that goes against the idea
<Sync time="211.705"/>
of the basic worth of women
<Sync time="213.530"/>
as human beings and not as objects . when it undermines
<Sync time="216.685"/>
the basic humanity of these people ,
<Sync time="218.890"/>
without the consent of individuals who are
<Sync time="221.520"/>
subconsciously being impacted in this way , we think it is a sufficient enough
<Sync time="225.970"/>
uh sufficient enough reason
<Sync time="227.315"/>
to ban beauty contests ,
<Sync time="228.865"/>
and we think that there is clear harm that derives from them .
<Sync time="231.135"/>
given all of these things ,
<Sync time="232.860"/>
we believe we should ban
<Sync time="234.640"/>
beauty contests .
<Sync time="236.270"/>
