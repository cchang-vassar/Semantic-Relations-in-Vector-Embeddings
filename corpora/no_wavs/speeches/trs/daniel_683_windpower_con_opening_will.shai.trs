we should not further exploit
<Sync time="2.560"/>
wind power .
<Sync time="3.780"/>
and the reason we shouldn't further exploit wind power is because
<Sync time="7.665"/>
on the comparative
<Sync time="9.550"/>
it's not really all that great of a form of energy .
<Sync time="12.775"/>
i don't really think that this is necessarily a comparative between whether we should exploit
<Sync time="17.350"/>
wind power versus oil and gas .
<Sync time="19.980"/>
i think that when power is probably better than oil and gas ,
<Sync time="23.260"/>
but at the point at which you're making a decision to exploit wind power ,
<Sync time="26.840"/>
that over something that's cheaper but more environmentally destructive like oil or natural gas ,
<Sync time="32.700"/>
then you probably have the capability to invest in alternative forms of
<Sync time="36.860"/>
green energy besides wind power .
<Sync time="38.740"/>
so things like solar energy or hydroelectric energy .
<Sync time="41.935"/>
so i think that if you're going to invest in uh ,
<Sync time="45.105"/>
obviously you should invest in some kind of a green type comparatively ,
<Sync time="48.770"/>
because it's a lot better than oil and gas for the environment , which is incredibly important right now so we don't all die .
<Sync time="54.615"/>
but as far as choosing the best form of ene- of uh
<Sync time="57.510"/>
alternative energy or
<Sync time="58.730"/>
green energy ,
<Sync time="59.835"/>
i think that when power is vastly inferior to alternatives like solar energy
<Sync time="64.420"/>
for a couple of reasons :
<Sync time="66.590"/>
first and foremost i think that wind energy um
<Sync time="69.330"/>
comes uh a lot more possible
<Sync time="71.860"/>
harms the environment
<Sync time="73.280"/>
than alternatives like solar energy .
<Sync time="75.665"/>
and the first reason for this is that %hes setting up wind farms is
<Sync time="79.800"/>
bad for the s-
<Sync time="80.495"/>
for like
<Sync time="81.460"/>
habitats of certain animals .
<Sync time="83.480"/>
so it can disrupt like bird migration patterns and it can kill birds . that's like a widely documented thing .
<Sync time="90.190"/>
and that's not good because birds are important . you don't want to disrupt bird migration patterns .
<Sync time="94.785"/>
uh you don't kill birds , they didn't do anything wrong .
<Sync time="98.080"/>
um
<Sync time="98.555"/>
you're like putting wind turbines in the middle of where they're flying and that's not right .
<Sync time="103.280"/>
but
<Sync time="104.075"/>

<Sync time="104.585"/>
also oftentimes um ,
<Sync time="106.960"/>
the , like , places where wind turbines are most effective ,
<Sync time="109.830"/>
where it's windiest , are on
<Sync time="112.630"/>
the like uh
<Sync time="113.390"/>
are by the ocean or by the water ,
<Sync time="116.190"/>
places where ecosystems are oftentimes more fragile .
<Sync time="119.930"/>
like you may have
<Sync time="121.100"/>
like %unclear there , you have a lot more um
<Sync time="123.990"/>
animal life in the area , like in shallow waters ,
<Sync time="127.090"/>
you have animals that like live around there too , you have
<Sync time="130.340"/>
birds that go there obviously , like sea animals .
<Sync time="132.755"/>
um and there's all kinds of ways in which having like
<Sync time="135.505"/>
fast moving wind turbines can
<Sync time="137.950"/>
be really destructive to nat- natural ecosystems .
<Sync time="141.110"/>
much more so than solar panels ,
<Sync time="143.460"/>
which you can just like plop on a roof
<Sync time="145.490"/>
or plop on roads or in the middle of the desert
<Sync time="148.730"/>
where there isn't all that much stuff , and they work pretty well and they don't really get in the way of much .
<Sync time="152.970"/>

<Sync time="153.550"/>
but in addition to
<Sync time="154.625"/>
that , i also think that they can be more effective in their use .
<Sync time="158.140"/>
like solar energy can be more much more effective than its use
<Sync time="161.040"/>
if exploited
<Sync time="162.050"/>
compared to wind farms , um
<Sync time="164.040"/>
wind power . and there's a few reasons
<Sync time="166.030"/>
for this :
<Sync time="166.725"/>
uh first and foremost because of the potential for energy .
<Sync time="170.310"/>
so
<Sync time="170.940"/>
the sun is just an infinitely stronger s- source of energy than the wind .
<Sync time="175.450"/>
like
<Sync time="176.015"/>
uh like the wind is fine but
<Sync time="178.130"/>
the sun has a lot more energy .
<Sync time="180.250"/>
like , the problem with solar energy right now is we're not able to tap a lot of the potential energy , 
<Sync time="184.850"/>
but that's the point .
<Sync time="185.980"/>
potential energy .
<Sync time="186.960"/>
the potential is there , because the sun is a lot stronger . so you're able to get more out of it if you keep exploiting it
<Sync time="192.510"/>
gree- if
<Sync time="193.265"/>
you exploit solar power . it's going to uh
<Sync time="195.910"/>
yield more benefits most likely .
<Sync time="197.965"/>
but i also think that um
<Sync time="199.635"/>
it's more diverse in the locations that you can put it in .
<Sync time="203.150"/>
like if you have to put wind turbines
<Sync time="205.040"/>
by a  beach because like beaches are more windy or in the ocean ,
<Sync time="208.770"/>
a lot of people won't like that because like it gets in the way of
<Sync time="211.530"/>
like
<Sync time="212.370"/>
beaches and or water and things like that . but it's also if it's in the ocean which is when you're it's farther away from
<Sync time="218.025"/>
like sources of um ,
<Sync time="219.615"/>
it's farther away from
<Sync time="221.115"/>
where people are living , which means that you're probably gonna lose energy in transmission ,
<Sync time="225.205"/>
in transporting the energy ,
<Sync time="227.440"/>
versus if you just put like solar panels on a roof ,
<Sync time="230.450"/>
that that's like a pretty easy way to get
<Sync time="232.800"/>
energy .
<Sync time="233.790"/>
if you put solar panels on like
<Sync time="236.330"/>
a park by like a parking lot or a garage , like all kinds of places ,
<Sync time="240.245"/>
they can fit in a lot of places , it's
<Sync time="241.780"/>
way more efficient and effective .
<Sync time="242.935"/>
so for those reasons don't exploit
<Sync time="245.430"/>
in wind power .
<Sync time="247.669"/>
