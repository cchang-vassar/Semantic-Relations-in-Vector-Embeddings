We should introduce universal health care.
So by this we mean to say that every country around the world should guarantee that all of their citizens have access to basic health care.
So, this might look like the national health service in england or it might look like an expanded version of obamacare, where private insurers but offer everyone insurance similar to the status quo in the US but more extensive.
We're okay with any policy that ultimately ensures that everyone in your country can go to the doctor, can fill prescriptions, and can receive emergency care.
Three reasons why.
First: we tell you that access to healthcare is a human right.
Why is this so?
Well, the first reason, if we think about rights that arise by convention or agreement, is that UN member states have all agreed that there is a right to healthcare.
We see that many UN member states offered charity and aid to other countries to guarantee that those countries' citizens have access to health care, because it's recognized as a fundamental human right.
But it's also a facilitative right we tell you.
Most every country in the world guarantees people some rights: the right to work, the right to vote, the right to speech, to practice a religion, and all of these things are contingent on access to healthcare.
People who are dying because they lack access to pharmaceutical drugs and the like can't access other political rights.
So we tell you that we need to introduce universal health care in order to uphold people's other rights which are more explicitly granted by their nation's constitutions.
At that point, we see that this is both a right by convention and a facilitative right, so it's clear that we should introduce universal health care in every country.
Our second argument is actually that universal health care will save nations money in the long term.
Let's think about what happened in america back before obamacare.
Many people would get sick and not go see the doctor because they didn't have access to health care.
Then, they would go to the emergency room where the law requires doctors to treat them.
So someone who started out with a case of pneumonia that it would have cost fifty euros to treat with antibiotics, now goes to the hospital and consumes thousands of dollars of health care, because they need their lungs drained and they need intensive medical treatment that lasts for days.
So we see that ultimately we would have saved a lot of money by offering this person a a primary care physician or a family doctor, depending on what they call them in different countries, rather than having them turn to emergency services.
But what's more, we also see many people go bankrupt in the US and some other countries although, fortunately, few of them, because of a lack of access to healthcare.
People, for instance, who can't go to the doctor, go to the emergency room, run up enormous bills, and then declare bankruptcy.
Which means that the hospitals lose money, and ultimately those hospitals have their debts written off by local or state governments because, let's face it, hospitals have to be funded somehow.
So, ultimately, we think everyone would save money, and this would help both individual citizens and also hospitals and municipal governments by offering health care.
Our third and final point is about economic growth.
So, I'll talk about first developed, then developing, countries.
In a developed country, like the united states, we think that the economy would grow and be more stable if more people were employed in the health care sector.
Ultimately, increasing access to health care will also increase demand for healthcare, which will lead to a health care boom.
In developing countries, we tell you that a major problem is that many people are unable to find work because of illnesses that are easily preventable.
Many people in nepal, for instance, have cataracts and eye disease that causes you to go blind.
This is easily treatable but ultimately, people without health care can't access that.
So they're not able to work.
They become a drain on their community.
But with basic access to health care, these people would be able to work once more and to contribute to their community.
So, ultimately, for these reasons, we should introduce universal healthcare.
Thank you.
