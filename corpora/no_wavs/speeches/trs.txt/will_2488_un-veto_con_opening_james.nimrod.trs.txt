I'm proud to stand in opposition of today's motion, that we should abolish the pee five veto power on the security council.
Two independent points of analysis, first, that the veto power assures stability in the security council, and on the UN at large, and secondly, that it increases the incentive for clientelism, when you get rid of the veto power.
But first, I want to make a note on the framework.
I think it's important to recognize, that when gov says: oh well, there's this issue with membership, that some of these people are outdated, and then they provide you with structural reasons why it's hard to move this membership around.
I think it's important to recognize, that that's probably not true, that you can create voting procedures for eliminating or adding members of the like with veto power, much in the same way that we change the membership of the security council, on a fairly regular basis.
These are things that change over time, and I think we already have mechanisms, that we apply to other aspects of the UN, that solve for those systemic changes pretty well.
So, I don't think we would have much difficulty in adjusting for these shifts.
So, under the first argument, that there is better stability in a world with a veto power.
It's important to recognize, that it ensures that nothing passes, that would initiate major conflict within the UN.
What I mean by this is that, for example, a resolution against russia wouldn't do very much to actually solve for this type of thing, right?
Like the US media, and like western media at large, often reports pretty extensively on things that russia does, that are bad, it's not like nobody knew about the invasion of ukraine.
The problem is that when you formalize these things through the UN, the most significant impact is just irritating russia, and situations that are pretty tense, it can absolutely spark rage.
I think a good example of this is actually what gov brings up: about resolutions against israel, in favor of palestine.
Those types of resolutions are very likely to enrage the united states, in such a way that could actually lead to conflict in the region.
I think even if it's not an all out war, even muscle flexing usually results in deaths, because of brinkmanship and border conflicts, and things like that.
So, it's key to continued membership as well, because nations are likely to leave the UN, if they don't think it works to their advantage.
This was talked about extensively in the lead up to the iraq war, back in two thousand and four.
So, I think it's worth recognizing then, that the veto power is one of the only things actually ensuring the stability, and continuity, of the united nations.
So, if you think that the UN does literally anything that is beneficial to the global structure, it's important to keep the veto in place.
Our second independent argument is that it increases incentives for clientelism, on their side of the house.
Why is this true?
So in the status quo, if the US doesn't like something that's coming up to the plate, they can just veto it and it's not an issue anymore.
On their side of the house though, this actually has to go through, what is referred to as, or what is nominally a democratic process.
But the problem is that the US actually has a decent amount of states, that will just do whatever they tell them to do.
Israel is obviously the go to example of this, but there are lots and lots of other states that, if the US was to just enact even a small amount of leverage against them, they would just bow to pressure.
This is true of pretty much all the hegemones that are on the security council, china has this power over a lot of members, as does russia.
So what happens then, when you can't just veto things you don't like, is there's an arms race to rack up as many clients as you can, to bully as many smaller nations into voting your way.
That results in a lot of harms, that usually means threat of sanctions from both sides.
So, you have to choose who's going to hurt you less.
It's worth recognizing then, that if their concern, on side government, is ensuring that smaller nations have a say within the global infrastructure, and have the ability to avoid punishment from larger nations for stepping out of line, the way to do that isn't incentivizing larger nations to just bully them whenever they want something to be killed, or something to pass.
Given that, I think it's really important to sustain the mechanism, that allows these large hegemons to get their way without like knocking down the smaller nations along the way.
Proud to oppose.
