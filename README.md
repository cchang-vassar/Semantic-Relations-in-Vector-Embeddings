# What are some possible ways of categorizing argument-counterargument relations?

_Categories_

1. Logical negation-ey thing
   - often one word different
   - e.g. people are born good | people are born bad
   - e.g. pineapple on pizza is tasty | pineapple on pizza is not tasty
2. Same material, different understanding
   - e.g. i dunno 90% of the non-analytic philosophy readings
3. Different perspective on same topic
   - e.g. political/social issues, which seems like most of what idebate.org is
4. Emotional
   - e.g. r/CMV, r/AITA?

_From argument theory_
Either attack premise, conclusion or reasoning between them 

\*P.S. How do these models do in 3+ party conversations?
