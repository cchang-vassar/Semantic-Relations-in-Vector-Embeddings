Despite enhanced access to education and political participation, women remain underrepresented in leadership positions worldwide. The gender inequality in representation is often explained through historical, cultural, socioeconomic, and institutional factors affecting women’s status. In 2013, the business world has only two female chief executives in the FTSE 100. [1] The introduction of gender quotas is an effort to close the participatory gap between genders. Both those in favour and against quotas link their arguments to the effects on the economic factors. The latest example takes place in the European Union (EU) where the voluntary self-regulation aiming at gender equality in boardrooms did not change the status quo and women still account for only 13.5 per cent of board members in large public companies. [2] This failure resulted in a proposal from the EU Commission that will require national governments to impose penalties, such as fines or a loss of government contracts, when more than 60 per cent of a firm’s non-executive directors are of the same gender in 2020. State-owned companies will have to meet the requirement by 2018. [3] The written style of the proposal ensures that men are likewise not negatively affected by gender imbalance. It would introduce reporting requirements for any company in which fewer than two out of five posts on the corporate board were held by women or men. In those cases, the companies would have to prove candidates for board positions had been chosen purely on the basis of experience. In situations where finalists had the same level of experience, the post would have to go to the candidate from the gender underrepresented on the board -- in most cases to a woman. [4]

This debate requires some definitions. This discussion interprets ‘gender quotas’ as a set minimum of reserved places for women in business institutions that could be constitutional and/or legislative or voluntary. By ‘advantageous’, the proposition argues that gender quotas stimulate, support, or foster an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, compared to the period prior to their introduction.
