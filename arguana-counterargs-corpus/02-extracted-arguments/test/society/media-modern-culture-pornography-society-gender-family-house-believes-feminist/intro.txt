The feminist movement is difficult to define. In essence, it is composed of people who adhere to an ideology, feminism, which originates from philosophical principles of equality. As such, they oppose any kind of dehumanisation or exploitation, in particular when targeted at women. In practice, feminists are particularly opposed to the existence of patriarchal structures in society and to the social construction of gender, as opposed to sex. This common ideology has led to some great successes for feminism in the past, such as women’s right to vote since the 19 th or 20 th Centuries, or equal pay in most developed countries. (Global Wage Report 2012/13: Wages and Equitable Growth) [1]

It is important to note that the feminist movement is, however, severely fragmented on more nuances social questions. On particular issues such as prostitution or the burka, many feminists disagree as to what empowers women and what oppresses them, as to what liberates women because they do so freely, and what harms them because are pressured to do it by the patriarchy.

Pornography is a particularly contentious issue. We take pornography to be any sexually explicit material, usually commercially distributed, acted or containing acting with the intention to arouse its viewers. It is currently legal in most liberal countries, although Iceland, for instance, is attempting to ban it in the near future (Henscher). [2] Where it is not yet illegal, it is under serious scrutiny: its currently immense role in society (over 70% of young men are estimated to watch porn at least once a month (Paul) [3] ) gives it great leverage in promoting, or reverting, social change. Social change, arguably, is the next key fight for the feminist movement. The question, then, comes down to whether pornography is a causal factor or a potential solution of the status quo of social oppression of women.
