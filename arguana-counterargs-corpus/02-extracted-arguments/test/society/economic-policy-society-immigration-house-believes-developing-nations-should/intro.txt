Urbanisation is what once formed civilisation. When we as a species transitioned from living in small communities that were dedicated to farming and small scale production to cities in which large amounts of people were gathered to produce and to consume, the stage was set, first for the Renaissance and later for the industrial revolution. In today’s society, urbanisation is still the trend, in 2010 the world for the first time had more than half of the world’s population lived in towns and cities and this is projected to increase to 60% by 2030. [1] While international migration often exercises national politics internal migration is much larger in terms of total numbers; while there were 190million international migrants in 2005, China alone had around the same number of internal migrants. [2] However, with increased mobility and a smaller need for manual labour, it is been put into doubt whether the cities can handle the vast amounts of people who enter on a daily basis. This is particularly problematic in developing nations where any city already has innate problems which might be exacerbated by the influx of more people. In major cities, such as Nairobi and Johannesburg, large townships have appeared, [3] often as large in themselves as major European cities, where poor people lead a parallel existence, separated from the urban community. Attempts have been made, in particular in China, to impose policies that keep people in the rural communities from moving into the cities, in order to stem the flow of domestic migration. [4] China’s Hukou system is one of China’s major social controls with the aim of directly regulating population distribution. It links Chinese citizens access to state benefits, and sometimes jobs, to the individual staying where they are registered. This does not prevent rural to urban migration, as it is possible to change status, but it does attempt to control migration. [5]

In this debate the government would make it illegal for people in the countryside to move into the cities without first receiving permission from the authorities. Failing to recognise the ban would lead to deportation to the community from whence the individual came and possibly other sanctions. This could be done through border controls or more probably by linking each individual’s identity to their community, by means of passports or social identity numbers, to make it impossible to live a functional life in the city without permission.
