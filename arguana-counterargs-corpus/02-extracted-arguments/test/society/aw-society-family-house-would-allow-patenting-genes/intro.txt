Due to the achievements of molecular biology and biotechnology over the past 30 years, culminating in the successes of the Human Genome Project (an international collaboration of scientists, as well as the contribution of private, ‘genomics’ corporations), we now have identified the entirety of the human genomic sequence. This enables us to identify genes in that sequence and to correlate changes in particular genes with the likelihood that those changes result in disease, such as cancer. It is believed that it is only a matter of time before this new knowledge leads to a tangible improvement in treatments of this disease.

The first patent on a recombinant DNA method was granted in December 1980, six months after the US Supreme Court ruling Diamond v. Chakrabarty, that a living, genetically engineered bacteria could be patented. The recombinant DNA patent, shared by Stanford University and the University of California, laid the groundwork for using cells to produce useful proteins and turning them into valuable drugs. Well before the Supreme Court decision, in 1977, the University of California had applied for patents on genes for insulin and growth hormone; the patent for insulin was granted in 1982 and the one for growth hormone in 1987. Gene patents were seen an extension of the legal doctrines that permitted patents on hormones, vaccines, and other “natural products” that had been turned into useful forms. 1

As of 2010, there were, in the US alone, roughly 40,000 patents held on genes 2 but only 6,000 on human genes. A patent grants to its owner the right to exclude others from making, using or selling a patented machine or composition of matter, or using a patented method, typically for a period of 20 years from the date of filing a patent application. The difference between trade secrets (which must be kept secret by their owner and do not protect against independent invention) and patents is that patents require disclosure that teaches the world how to make and use an invention, rewarding the inventor with a period of exclusivity during which time profits may be earned from its commercialization.

Even though there has been quite some time the practice of awarding patents on genes, upheld by the courts, it has come under scrutiny and criticism by some scientists, legal scholars, and politicians. The subject of gene patenting involves various ethical, legal, and economic components. Questions raised are both of a practical and more principal nature – What should constitute a patent? How long should a patent last? As well as an equally difficult, moral one: Should we patent the ‘building blocks of life’? Should medicine be an area for profit at all?

Patenting is a process that is very common in the developed world; before a product is patented it is examined by a patent agency (e.g., the European Patent Office, the US Patent and Trademark Office). Gene patents have been granted by the USPTO since 1980, proving that the processes and systems are in place to handle and grant gene patents.

Afterwards, a patent to a gene provides the “negative right” that no third party is permitted to “practice” the invention for 20 years from the filing date, without the patentee’s permission. Once that 20 year period expires, the invention claimed by the patent can be practiced freely by anyone without restriction (except for regulatory agency requirements in the appropriate instance). Unauthorized practice of a patented invention raises liability for infringement which is resolved by a lawsuit between the parties.4

The outcome of such a lawsuit can be settlement, money damages or an injunction for the prevailing patentee; the accused infringer can prevail by convincing the judge or jury that she does not infringe or that the patent is invalid.

N.B. since this debate was written the US Supreme Court in the case of Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. has ruled that "a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated" however this is still a live issue as the EU at least still considered genes to be patentable stating “an element isolated from the human body or produced by means of a technical process, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentable invention.”
