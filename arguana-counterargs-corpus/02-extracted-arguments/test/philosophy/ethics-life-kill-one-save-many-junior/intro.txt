Imagine a train track with five people tied to it. To the side there is another track with one person tied to it. A train is heading straight down the line towards the five people and is going too fast to stop. There is a lever next to you which would change the course of the train and divert it down the track with one person tied to it. There is no one else around and only you can decide whether to pull the lever or not. You do not know any of the people involved and also do not know anything about their lives. Do you divert the train or allow it to run its course?

The main theory that is involved in this question is called ‘Utilitarianism’. Utilitarianism makes the claim that a person should do the action that creates the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. Any action can be justified within utilitarianism if it creates more ‘good’ than another action. Utilitarianism is, therefore, a theory that deals with outcomes and comes under the broader sphere of ‘consequentialism.’

The opposing theory to consequentialism is something that is known as ‘deontology’. This is a theory that says certain actions are always wrong no matter what the consequences. For instance, in deontology, lying might always be considered wrong regardless of the consequences; the act of lying itself is the thing to be considered. However, in consequentialism, a lie can be justified on the occasions in which its effects are deemed to be good; the consequences of lying are the things to be considered.
