Broadly speaking, the Right to Die is considered to cover two issues in legislative terms – voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide. The first of these relates to the right of the individual to say that doctors may intervene – or at least withhold treatment – if they enter a state where they are incapable of living without medical support. Assisted suicide, in legal terms, primarily concerns the issue of whether someone who has a degenerative illness and has reached the point where they are incapable of killing themselves may legally involve another person – usually a loved one or doctor - without that second person facing criminal charges. Both of these are set in a wider ethical question of whether our lives are our own to conclude as we see fit [i] , [ii] .

Several recent, high-profile, instances of individuals seeking assisted suicide in response to incurable diseases – such as the author Terry Pratchett - has raised the issue of the extent to which dying, in and of itself, is a matter for the individual or the state. Death is, of course, an emotive issue and framing legislation relating to the end of life is notoriously difficult. Suicide – assisted or otherwise – has been seen as a crime in many countries and still is in some . However, advances in medicine meaning that it is possible to keep individuals alive long after would have been the case a few generations ago have raised a key question – just because it’s possible to keep someone alive, is it necessary a good idea?

Even starting at the extreme of murder, it’s surprisingly difficult to demonstrate why it is immoral without coming to the conclusion that it’s mainly a crime because it denies the victim choice. So where a person chooses to die is there even a moral issue at all, let alone a legal one?

Both philosophers and medics make a distinction between a passive approach – withdrawing medication and allowing nature to take its course – and an active intervention which directly brings about the death of the individual. There is anecdotal evidence [iii] that the first type is surprisingly common and the latter is more common than one might imagine. The first group falls mostly under the general term of ‘euthanasia’ and the second would, generally, be thought of as ‘assisted suicide’ but drawing a meaningful line between the two is quite difficult.

At one extreme, there’s the issue of turning off the life-support machine of a patient in a permanent vegetative state, at the other giving assistance to an otherwise healthy individual who simply no longer wants to live. Of course there’s then a step beyond that where no assistance is required and the individual commits suicide themselves, what should their family’s and wider society’s response to that be?

In many countries, especially those where religious organisations are dominant, for suicide to be covered up as it is seen as a sin. Despite this, families of suicides have been known to ask coroners to change their findings to suggest death by natural or unexplained causes as a result of shame, religious or social in origin [iv] .

The issue of the right to life is one that exercises many commentators and furious legislative debate. The right to die – and our wider relationship to death – is one that has tended to receive less attention and, when it has done so, the debate has tended to be conducted in muted tones with very few hard and fast moral principles to cling onto. In part, this is, perhaps, inevitable. As a species the desire to live is hard wired into our DNA and it is difficult to conceive that, for some, they may have reached an entirely rational and reasonable decision that they have finished with life. It is much easier to conjure the image of a baby and make the case that it should not be denied its potential than it is to face a grown adult who is in obvious pain and tell them that they just have to put up with it.

Realistically, in legislative terms, the debate on assisted suicide relates to how it impacts on the ‘supporting characters’; the relative or medic required to help someone who may have to give assistance – is that person open to prosecution. There is also a practical question, in the case of the medic, is it fair to ask an individual who has dedicated their life to saving life to assist in ending it? This debate is however broader than that, there is already a debatabase debate on assisted suicide [v] , and one on suicide, [vi] instead this debate focuses on the issue of choice and rights.

Debaters’ Note

Clearly this debate covers an enormous number of topics; political, legal, philosophical, ethical, medical and others. From the point of view of proposition, it is important to nail down a tight definition. It’s important to give the parameters in which the right to die would apply otherwise opposition can easily portray the situation of people wandering into emergency rooms and asking to end it all because they’ve had a bad day. Does the right to die exist only in the case of a terminal medical condition? Is old age a sufficient justification? Are psychological and medical examinations of the individual required? What protection is there from relatives killing off their relations and then insisting that it was suicide? If ever there was a debate in which prop needs to give a clear overview of how the process would work, then this is it. They should aim to set out a process in which it has been demonstrated that the potential suicide is in full control of her own mental faculties and has not been placed under pressure by others to end her life. Even with these secured opposition may argue, as some ethicists have, that the decision to commit suicide is, itself, prima fasciae evidence of a disturbed mind. Prop would also do well to place the debate over assisted suicide in countries where regular suicide is already legal – it’s simply an easier case to argue.
