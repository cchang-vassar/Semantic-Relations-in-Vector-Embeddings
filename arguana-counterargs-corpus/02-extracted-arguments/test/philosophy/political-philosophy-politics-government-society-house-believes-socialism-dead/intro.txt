Tactical note: One of the difficulties with any debate relating to ideology is that, to put it mildly, they raise definitional problems. Capitalism is relatively easy although certainly Smith would be unlikely to recognise the actions of the red in tooth and claw Capitalists of modern banking. However, that is beside the point. Socialism is even more difficult to define as it tends to be used in both positive and pejorative terms. The added difficulty is that there is a world of difference between the steady social justice of Scandinavia and the ramblings of the regime in North Korea and yet both lay claim to the word.

As a result it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate in to Prop rambling on about 1989 and Op extolling the virtues of paternity leave in Sweden. Neither approach gets very far. Socialism is ultimately about economics, social justice and the distribution of wealth.

The death of Socialism has been declared in many ways and usually by people who don’t understand what it means. However there is little doubt that the global Left looks very different now from how it appeared in a pre-Reagan/Thatcher era, or for that matter pre-Clinton. Certainly in the Anglo-Saxon world Clinton and Blair shifted massively on the issue of using taxation as a method of redistribution of wealth, and that is a trend that appears to be continuing under their successors.

Writers and intellectuals have spent much of the last two decades either bemoaning or relishing the demise of the organised left although they tend to overlook certain things. Primarily, if one were to sit down with Morris or Orwell and describe the world in 2012-especially the West-they would be staggered at the progress that had been made in terms of promoting the rights of the individual against those of a capitalist elite. Many of these battles were won directly because of the actions of Socialists and others as a result of a changing dialectic they inspired. Since those results remain – universal suffrage, the abolition of child labour, the establishment of socialised medicine and universal education, in Europe at least – does that mean that socialism is alive and well?

Alternatively, one can argue that for the most part the Socialist parties of Europe have hung up their red flags, gone back to their ideological drawing boards and returned with something that looks very much like Market Capitalism but with a few of the sharper edges smoothed off and painted a nicer colour. Increasingly, those who even use the word in European discourse tend to look either desperately out of date or terribly, terribly isolated.

Realistically this debate is not focussed anywhere near America, where (whatever Newt Gingrich may think) Socialism never even got started. It is also hard to set in Asia where entirely different political traditions produced a range of comparable conclusions – but that confuses things.

The “Occupy” protests that came to prominence in 2011 give an interesting perspective on proceedings and raises an interesting question: can any of the protests – be that the Occupy movements or the more sporadic anti-austerity protests, be meaningfully described as socialist?
