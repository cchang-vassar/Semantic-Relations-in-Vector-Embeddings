Affirmative action (or positive discrimination) is the use of different standards for assessing different groups of people, so as to help a group that has historically been at a disadvantage. [1] [2] In an education context, the relevant type of affirmative action is that used for admission to universities. In particular, universities may wish to use affirmative action to raise the presence of poor students or students from ethnic minorities. There are several Affirmative Action policies which occur around the world from New Zealand where the Maori minority is favoured to South Africa where the legacy of Apartheid aims to be corrected to the United States where Black and Hispanic students may be given preferential treatment in admission procedures. [3] [4] Such discrimination is a controversial issue, notably in the United States, where a 2003 Supreme Court decision ruled that universities are allowed to use the practice. [5] Debates may either be about permitting universities to use positive discrimination (where it is currently illegal), or about the state requiring them to do so. The mechanism could be one of two types: either using quotas to determine the outcome of the admissions process (e.g. requiring universities to admit a certain percentage of students from minority groups, deprived areas, or non-private schools), or by using different admissions criteria that take race, poverty or school-background into account.
