The issue of Scottish independence has long been a controversial one in both Scotland and the rest of the UK. When the Labour government introduced the Scotland Act in 1998 [i] it was the centerpiece of their constitutional legislation but was expected to “kill Nationalism stone dead” in the words of George Robertson. [ii] That prediction has not proven to be the case; at least not as far as the Scottish National Party’s (SNP) political strength is concerned.

After a relatively successful first term as a minority administration, the SNP was returned with a majority administration in 2011. It is worth explaining to those unfamiliar with the Scottish political and electoral system the significance of this result. The electoral system was essentially designed to prevent any one party ever establishing a majority. The swing to the SNP came from all parties other than the Greens. The leaders of the Scottish Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties all resigned because their results had been so bad. Labour went a stage further and restructured the party. [iii]

At a cursory reading this would suggest massive support for Scottish independence and the death-knell of the Union with the rest of the UK. However, this is simply not supported by the polls. Although support for the SNP increased immensely (and Labour, in particular, was criticized for running a terrible campaign) support for their key policy barely changed at all. It remains well below fifty percent on both sides of the Border [iv] .

This raises a difficult political reality for the SNP and particularly its charismatic leader Alex Salmond MSP [v] . With a majority in parliament he has no excuse not to call a referendum on independence and his traditional supporters would be unlikely to forgive him if he failed to do so. However, with support for independence running at between 30 and 40 percent, he knows that he would be unlikely to win it. His solution has been to create a long run up to the referendum, setting the date as some time in autumn 2014 intending to use the period to persuade the voters.

However what the referendum question will be has not yet been set and this is where the issue becomes interesting within the confines of this debate, especially from the point of view of Opposition. With limited support for full out independence, a compromise position called ‘Devolution-Max’ has emerged as a popular third option in between full autonomy and the status quo. [vi] The original devolution model gave the Scottish Parliament and Executive authority over a diverse but still limited range of domestic policy areas. While it has not been very well defined by any party devolution-max would significantly include almost all domestic policy powers with Westminster only retaining responsibility over some areas of foreign policy and macro-economics. Opp therefore need to decide whether it is supporting devo-max, which cedes the principal of greater powers, or giving a full throated defense of the Union as it currently exists, which, as with any status quo defense, leaves them, having to defend every inconsistency in the existing legislation – of which there are quite a lot. This debate does a little of both, by way of demonstration rather than example
