The European single currency affiliated to the European Union (EU) is called the Euro. It was launched on January 1st, 1999 amid a blaze of Europhoria (sic). This wave of strong enthusiasm for the Euro that was seen in other European Union Member States, notably Ireland, remains absent in Britain. Opinion on the European single currency is extremely divided in Britain. Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke of the Conservative Party did and continue to support it, whereas Tony Benn (Labour) opposes it today as much as he did before he retired to "devote more time to politics". These politicians hold views on the Euro that are not typical of their political parties, which demonstrates the complexity and bitterness of the argument. Supporters of the Euro fear that if Britain does not join, London will eventually lose her position as the European financial centre and her sphere of influence and jobs will be lost. Whereas opponents argue that London is such a strong financial centre anyway that European business will inevitably gravitate towards her instead. would staying out present bigger and more disadvantages than joining? Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?
