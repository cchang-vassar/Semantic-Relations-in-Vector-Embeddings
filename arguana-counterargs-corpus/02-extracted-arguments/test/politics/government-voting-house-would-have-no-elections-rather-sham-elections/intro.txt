Elections are the lifeblood of all democracies; they are where the people have the chance to make their choice of government, often after years where their only real influence has been through protest and the media. Yet not all countries that have elections are really democratic. Elections have become close to universal with many countries that are ‘autocratic’ also having elections just like any democracy. These elections are often a sham in the sense that there is no real chance of there being a change in government as a result of the vote. Thus we might consider there to be another criteria beyond simply holding elections that determines if a country is truly democratic; whether the elections they hold are ‘free and fair’.

In the Declaration on Free and fair Elections the Inter-Parliamentary Council set out numerous conditions for elections qualifying as free and fair including:

“Voting Rights

Every adult citizen has the right to vote in elections, on a non-discriminatory basis.

No eligible citizen shall be denied the right to vote or disqualified from registration as a voter

Every voter is entitled to exercise his or her right equally with others and to have his or her vote accorded equivalent weight to that of others.

Party Rights

Everyone has the right to take part in the government of their country and shall have an equal opportunity to become a candidate for election

Everyone individually and together with others has the right:

To express political opinions without interference;

To seek, receive and impart information and to make an informed choice;

To move freely within the country in order to campaign for election;

To campaign on an equal basis with other political parties, including the party forming the existing government.

Responsibilities of States… to guarantee the rights and institutional framework for periodic and genuine, free and fair elections” [1]

There are many ways in which there may be elections within an autocratic setting. In a few cases the ‘democratic element’ is purely for show; Qatar is from this year (2013) holding elections (currently suspended due to a handover of power) for its advisory council but as an advisory body it is clear the real power will remain with the Emir. [2] It is much more usual that the ruling party simply ensures that the opposition can never get enough seats to form a majority. This may be done in several different ways. In Burma (Myanmar) for example the National League for Democracy faces a parliament where many of the seats are not contested in elections, in the House of Representatives the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party has 259 seats, of which 110 were directly appointed. [3] The main opposition the National League for Democracy won 40 out of the 45 seats it contested in byelections showing that it would likely win if there were an election without restrictions. [4] Alternatively as in Zimbabwe there may be intimidation and violence in the elections themselves. [5] Or the results may be determined in advance through ballot stuffing, vote rigging, and bussing in supporters so they vote several times as occurs in Russia. [6] The methods may be different but the outcome is the same; certain victory for the ruling party.
