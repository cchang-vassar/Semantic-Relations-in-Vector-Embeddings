In 2010, the leader of Canada’s Bloc Québécois party, Gilles Duceppe, explained to a US audience that Quebec sovereignty is not yet a settled issue and that it would be a win-win for all of North America, especially those who still believe in the “Canadian Dream.” [1] The leader wants a third referendum on Quebecois secession from the Canadian Federation [2] , believing that it will deliver a resounding “yes” to independence. However, in a recent poll 58% of Quebecers feel that the question of sovereignty is entirely outmoded [3] , with only 26% feeling that it is “more relevant than ever.” [4] This same poll showed that less than 14% of Quebecers believe that, regardless of merit, an independent Quebec will exist in the next 30 years [5] .

Quebec independence is an issue that traces back to conflict between the French and English over the colonization of Canada in the 1600s [6] . The fight for independence has taken on many different forms, including the creation of a terrorist organization called the Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) in the 1960s, who were responsible for over 200 bombings between 1963 and 1970 [7] . The FLQ famously kidnapped a Canadian Minister, Pierre Laporte and British Trade Commissioner, James Cross in the fall of 1970 [8] . This situation culminated in the murder of Pierre Laporte and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau enacting the War Measures Act [9] .

Beyond the violent past that tarnishes the name of the movement, the struggle for independence in felt by French Canadians who struggle to retain their own language and culture in an overwhelmingly Anglophone Canada [10] . This debate is about the rights of French Canadians to their own self-determination and how they can best protect their unique culture and language.
