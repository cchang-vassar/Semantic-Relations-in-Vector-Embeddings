The figure of Lenin as the father of modern Russia and that of Stalin as the strong leader par excellence have remained an important part of the Russian identity and its vision of leadership. A nation that spreads over a territory of 1 million square miles with a diverse historical background and with a population of even more diverse cultural backgrounds, Russia is by no means an easy state to manage. The ability to lead is thus maintained in high regard by the people of Russia and perhaps the only recent leader to match Lenin’s revolutionary spirit and Stalin’s strong personality and stern decision-making style has been Vladimir Putin.

Since the famous Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and the emergence and rule of the Communist Party that followed, Russia has experienced both the highs of economic progress and revolutionizing politics as well as the lows of political purges, Great Patriotic War (WWII), the Cold War and economic collapse. With the introduction of the famous Gorbachev reforms of perestroika and glasnost in the 1980s, Russia began to open up to the capitalist system and to the idea of liberal democracy. Following Gorbachev’s reforms, Boris Yeltsin continued to lead Russia towards slow democratic reform until 2000 when Vladimir Putin was elected President. A former KGB officer who had kept a fairly low profile in post-communist Russian politics, Putin emerged as a quiet yet powerful leader who was not afraid to make bold statements and take swift actions. Riding on a platform of fighting corruption, secession and terrorist threats, Putin won the hearts and minds of disillusioned Russians. However, his political actions and powerful character risk turning him into more of an authoritarian leader than the elected leader of a democratic country. In 2008 Putin completed his second term in office, swapping roles with his former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Although nominally inferior to President Medvedev, Putin is widely considered to still be the real power in Russia and may well run for President again in 2012.
