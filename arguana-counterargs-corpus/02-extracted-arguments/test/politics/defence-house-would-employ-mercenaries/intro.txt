Mercenaries, or hired soldiers, have long played a part in warfare. The Persians used 4,000 Greek mercenaries against Alexander the Great; The English East India Company employed its own private army to gain control of the subcontinent. The development of modern centralised nation states over the past two centuries saw a decline in these men-for-hire, replaced by large national standing armies. However, the use of hired private armies has risen again over the past two decades in the form of PMCs (Private Military Contractors). Military duties are outsourced by both weak states unable to attract, train and pay recruits, as well as developed states forced to economise. This practice is so widespread that many governments acknowledge it as legitimate, sparking calls for its legislation as well as questioning of its moral defence.

Those who see the use of mercenaries as legitimate argue that they are an inevitable and effective aspect of modern warfare and that international recognition would open the way for regulation, which would make clearer the lines of responsibility. Opponents stress the difficulty of making private armies accountable for their actions, particularly given their tendency to ignore other areas of international law.
