The House of Lords is seen by some as an antiquated addition to our government structure, a mockery of modern democracy and an inhibiting influence in the drive for progress. While the function of a second chamber is recognised as beneficial as it ensures checks and balances on the activity of the House of Commons, the composition of its members reflects a society long past, a reminder of a time when equality was not a social aspiration. New Labour’s first stage of reform in 1999 did some work to reduce hereditary peers in the House of Lords (now standing at 92), but since then the gradual phasing in of reforms that was proposed has failed to materialise. Many advocates of democracy and the right of law are now calling for these reforms to be completed, to abolish members of birth right and to introduce an electorally voted body to ensure that the House of Lords is as fully democratic as the rest of our country claims to be. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg presented The House of Lords Reform Draft Bill and the accompanying White Paper to Parliament on 17 May 2011. It proposed reform to a smaller, 80%-elected House with 15-year maximum terms for elected peers. [1] Whether or not this bill will be met with enthusiasm, apathy or disdain, and whether or not it will prove to the greater good for the House of Lords and government of Britain, is yet to be seen.
