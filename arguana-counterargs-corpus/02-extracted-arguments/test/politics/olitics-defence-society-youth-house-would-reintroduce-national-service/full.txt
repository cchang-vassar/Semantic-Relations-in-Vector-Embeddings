# THESIS
This House would reintroduce national service


# INTRO
Conscription refers to the compulsory enrolment of citizens to national service. National service does not always include military service but traditionally revolves around the prospect or existence of a state of war. The object of conscription is to permit the mass recruitment of young men and women, in times of need, to come to the aid of the state. Of the contemporary examples of conscription being used, the Vietnam is perhaps most infamous for its popular images of American conscientious objectors burning their draft cards in objection to the war's justifications. Conscription was subsequently abolished in the United States in 1973, but it remains in many states, such as Finland and Austria in the developed world and Mexico and Thailand in the developing world, as a bulwark against potential aggression. Proponents also argue that conscription benefits the citizens enlisted, encouraging their patriotism and teaching them invaluable life skills. Opponents respond that the lives of one's citizens cannot be used as property to use in times of war and that regardless, there are economic disincentives to conscription.
