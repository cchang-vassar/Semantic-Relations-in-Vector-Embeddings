Animal research has been used for several centuries as part of efforts to better understand the world around us. More than 100,000,000 animals a year are used in animal testing, most of them put down once they are have been experimented on.[1]

The drugs industry spends a significant amount of time conducting research on animals. As few drugs go successfully from development to sale, over 5.75 million animals are used for each successful new drug. Chemical safety testing uses less animals, in some cases none at all, each using less than a thousand per chemical.

While most research is classed as causing little pain or suffering to the animals, in the USA in 2010 just short of 100,000 animals were used for experiments likely to cause pain or suffering with no use of painkillers or sedatives.
