Despite launching as recently as 2004 Facebook has quickly become the biggest social network on the internet. It has more than a billion members of whom half log in daily. It is one of the biggest companies in the world with its market value passing $100 billion in the summer of 2013.(1) Without any doubt, is has had a tremendous effect upon its users, the question is if it’s beneficial or not. Proponents argue that it enhances socialization and serves as a platform to spread information among numerous individuals while opponents believe its very existence is detrimental to children making them more prone to anxiety and depression. Early in 2013, reports suggested that Facebook lost nine million active monthly users in the U.S and two million in Britain, showing that many think that Facebook now has too much of a negative impact on their lives.

With Facebook being the social network of choice for so many and having an immense amount of influence over how we interact the question of whether the social network is beneficial is of vital importance.
