While the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has many components, the struggle for land is at its centre, and therefore the legitimacy or lack thereof of Israeli Settlements in the West Bank has become symbolic of the conflict.

To the Palestinians, the Israeli settlements represent the slow erosion of their national claims occurring in front of their eyes. Even if some smaller settlements are removed in a final Peace Agreement, many Palestinians are sceptical that the larger ones will ever be removed. A number of Israeli politicians share that view, and while the original argument for the creation of settlements in the late 1970s was one of security, many Israeli far-right politicians such as Avigador Lieberman now admit that the goal of further construction is to alter the “facts on the ground.”

Equally importantly however, the settlement issue is increasingly seen as a measure of the ability and willingness of the United States government to buck Israel publicly. President Obama has been lambasted by Republicans for his stand calling for a halt to settlement construction – President George HW Bush, who actually cancelled a major loan to Israel over the issue faced a rebellion within his own party, and believed that the backlash helped to cost him re-election in 1992.
