Self-determination is loosely defined as the right of nations or peoples to "freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development" 1. It is common to hear the assertion that this is a "fundamental human right". But what exactly does this mean, and is it correct?

Self-determination is an issue in many different contexts around the world. Many of these involve states which have, through territorial expansion, population shifts, boundary changes, independence from or colonisation of other nations, found themselves in charge of minority groups who may have strong ethnic, national, religious, cultural or linguistic differences from other inhabitants of a nation. This can lead to all sorts of problems; minorities may identify more strongly with a neighbouring state, or fear that their cultural and political identity is being diluted by state policies, while nation states are often concerned about instability or loss of their strong national identity if minority groups are given too much autonomy or special treatment.

So, on balance, is self-determination a universal right that should be available to all peoples, or is it an idea whose time has passed?
