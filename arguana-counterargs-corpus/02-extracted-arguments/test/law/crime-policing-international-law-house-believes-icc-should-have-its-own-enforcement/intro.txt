The ICC does not have its own police force [1] . Currently, in order for the ICC to be able to bring defendants to trial, it needs to enlist the assistance of member states in order to bring defendants in to trial [2] . In theory, this should be automatic.

However, in practice this is not the case. In addition to the failure to capture Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders in the Uganda situation, Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir travelled to an African Union event in Nigeria, a state party to the ICC, but the Nigerian authorities claimed that they could not arrest him due to provisions in the AU treaties [3] .

An ICC enforcement arm could take on a large number of forms, and its proponents have not formed a consensus around any one of them. It could be on various sizes, be based in one location or out of several. One area that would need to be established is if it were to be based on the complementarity principle that is used for making decisions to prosecute – the ICC will not get involved unless the state is unable or unwilling to take action.

What exactly would an enforcement arm for the ICC look like? There have in the past been suggestions that there should be a United Nations Rapid Reaction force capable of intervening in crisis situations of cases of state collapse, in the 1990s the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan decided against any attempt to create a UN Standing Army, but wished to increase the rapidity of response using UN members. [4] What an enforcement arm for the ICC means then could be anything from such a Standing Army down to a small force made up of experts that supports national militaries with training and technology based on the model of the multinational police forces set up in Bosnia in the late 1990s. [5]

In this instance we intend to take a middle course between the extremes of a light training force and a full scale army. An ICC enforcement arm would potentially be quite heavily armed as it may need to fight armed non-governmental groups but it would not have the capabilities to engage even the smallest states. It would not therefore be able to snatch a war criminal who is being specifically sheltered by a state. The mandate of the force would be to intervene either if asked to help internally by a national government or authorised by a United Nations Security Council resolution which would to a certain extent enable the pursuit of a war criminal across borders.
