Under the status quo in most English-speaking jurisdictions, a defendant’s previous convictions cannot be brought up in court until after the jury has given its verdict. This includes Scotland [1] , America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Britain. This is because these countries believe that each case should be evaluated on its own merits, and that ‘knowledge of previous offences would prejudice the outcome of a trial’ [2] . However, other countries such as France allow previous convictions to be disclosed before a verdict is reached [3] . Exceptions are made in Britain in cases where the case under trial is ‘strikingly similar’ to a past offence, in which case it is believed that the value of the evidence ‘outweighs any prejudicial effect’ [4] . Previous convictions may also be disclosed if the defendant ‘falsely claims to be of good character’ [5] . Though previous convictions are not currently disclosed before the verdict of guilty or not guilty, judges may consider previous convictions when they decide the sentence for defendants deemed guilty [6] . There is a great interest in making sure that criminals are adequately punished for their crimes – particularly where recidivism shows that previous punishment has had little effect – in the interest of justice and public safety.

When choosing a mechanism for this debate, you may wish to think about the scope of argument and breadth of debate you want to have. The first option is to defend a criminal justice system which allows previous convictions to be revealed in a case of similarity to past convictions, where the defendant falsely claims good character, or where the defendant attacks the character of a prosecution witness, as is the status quo in Britain [7] . This takes on a smaller burden for the proposition and highlights particular points where past convictions could certainly be pertinent to the case and its relevance is pinpointed. The other option is to defend the model used by France where previous convictions are routinely disclosed [8] . This requires the proposition to argue that the majority of cases would actively benefit from these disclosures by citing high recidivism rates after an initial offence and more general issues such as greater transparency within the courtroom. This is a wider debate with more potential for principles, rather than practical, arguments.
