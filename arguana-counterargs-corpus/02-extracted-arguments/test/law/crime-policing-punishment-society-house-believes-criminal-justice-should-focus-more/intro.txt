The criminal justice system comprises many distinct stages, including arrest, prosecution, trial, sentencing, and punishment (quite often in the form of imprisonment). Rehabilitation can take place in any of these phases as the police for example can impose on the spot penalties and cautions but these are not controversial it is in the last two of these many stages that there is debate over whether the criminal justice system should focus more on rehabilitation than on retribution.

Rehabilitation is the idea of reforming a prisoner so that they can reintegrate back into society upon their release. This process involves various programs including anger management, education programs and even creative workshops to form another outlet for expression. It is hoped that through this process they will become less inclined to commit crimes in the future. It seeks to prevent a person from reoffending by taking away the desire to offend. This is very different from the idea of ‘deterrence’ (which is the idea of making him afraid to offend, though he may still desire to), and the idea of ‘incapacitation’ (which is the idea of taking away his physical power to offend, though he may still desire to and be unafraid to) however even under these theories the assumption is that after the offender has spent their time they will be much less of a threat to society, can be released and will not reoffend.

The retributive idea is that punishment should be determined chiefly (possibly even only) by the seriousness of the crime itself, and not by consequentialist factors, such as whether the punishment is enough to scare (i.e. deter) the rest of society. The term ‘retribution’ is therefore unfortunate because its everyday meaning connotes ‘revenge’; it is better described as ‘desert’, ‘just deserts’ or ‘proportionality’ theory.

Crimes such as murder or other equally severe crimes do deserve imprisonment as a punishment, rehabilitation should be considered for lesser crimes, for example those caught looting during the August riots in the UK. For these offenders, particularly for those who were first time offenders, imprisonment would only add to their anger against the government and police. Whereas rehabilitation, it the form of education and helping rebuild houses/businesses damaged by the riots, this would work on reforming their attitudes and perceptions of the UKs legal system and therefore they would more easily integrate into society. Almost all non-violent and crimes against property would be better met with rehabilitation rather than lengthy imprisonment.
