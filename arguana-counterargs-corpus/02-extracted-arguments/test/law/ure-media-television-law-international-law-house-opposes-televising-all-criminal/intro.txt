The broadcasting of trials may be through TV or across the web. Currently, ICC trials are web streamed on their website with a 30 minute delay. This feed is also used by television broadcasters and used for reporting.

Probably the most infamous televised criminal trial was that of OJ Simpson in California in the mid-1990s. Simpson, Heisman Trophy winning running back and later actor, was tried for the murder of his ex-wife and her friend. The trial, which resulted in a not guilty verdict, was broadcast live.

A more recent source of debate in the United Kingdom was Channel 4’s non-live broadcast of the retrial of Nat Fraser for the murder of his wife, Arlene [1] . The 90 minute long programme showed footage of the six week trial, which occurred the prior year, in addition to interviews with people involved. This came after three years of negotiation [2] , and was the second British murder trial filmed, the first in its entirety. While in England and Wales all filming and photography in criminal courts is prohibited, the law in Scotland (which, while part of the United Kingdom maintains its own legal system) is less strict, allowing filming if everyone involves consents to do so. In the United Kingdom some civil appeal cases are broadcast, such as some of those at the United Kingdom Supreme Court, are already broadcast live online, and filming criminal sentencing is being considered [3] . Civil law systems, in general, do not use juries (one of the factors that makes it harder to film trials due to the risk of them being identified) so there is less controversy surrounding the broadcast of trials in countries that use civil law.
