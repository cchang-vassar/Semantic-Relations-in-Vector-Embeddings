There are many relationships in which a duty of confidentiality is owed. This is true of doctor and patient relationships, relationships of employees to employers and also to lawyers and their clients. The overarching principle behind all of these confidences is that there are some relationships that require complete honesty and openness in order for the correct result to be obtained. If a business thought its employees could spread news about them freely and without consequence, they would not let their employees know aspects of the business and therefore the business would work less efficiently. If a patient did not tell their doctor the truth of their illness through fear their family would be told then the doctor could not efficiently cure the patient. The same is true of the lawyer and client relationship. However, given the nature of the legal environment and the law of privacy as it currently stands, is client-attorney privilege no longer desirable?
