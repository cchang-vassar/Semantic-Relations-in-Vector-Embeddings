Democratic states, while all aiming to uphold justice through a fair trial, have different approaches to the trials themselves. In the United States, well-publicised criminal trials can be televised, or documentaries can later portray the court proceedings [1] . One notable example of this is the case of O.J Simpson. However, in France, the media is not allowed to show the face of any suspect who has not yet been found guilty - and the French were outraged that American media showed Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s face before his trial began [2] . The Dutch justice system allows the press to refer to the accused, but only by their ‘first names and last initials’ [3] . All of this indicated that the justice system is not a matter of black-and-white interpretation, but it very sensitive to change. Those who oppose televised court cases argue that it only serves to make court cases theatrical, often focusing more on entertainment factor, or the lawyers and judges involved (particularly in the O.J Simpson trial [4] ), than achieving justice for its own sake. Televising court cases can bring a huge amount of public attention, whether overwhelming sympathy for the victim-figure, or hatred for the accused.

A conventional proposition case would argue that the whole court proceedings would be recorded by cameras around the courtroom. The faces of the jurors would not be shown (to try and avoid distorted verdicts). However, this in itself leans towards an admission that televising court cases could distort justice. The proposition would most likely exclude cases involving national security, or other cases where the presence of an audience is already limited, such as cases involving children [5] . It is already recognised that this information is too sensitive for public viewing; a prop line that acknowledges this is much easier to defend and falls into standards which are already in place.
