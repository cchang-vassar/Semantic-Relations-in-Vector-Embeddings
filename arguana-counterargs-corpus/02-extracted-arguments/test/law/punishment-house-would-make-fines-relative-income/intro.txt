Most countries impose fines rather than jail sentences for low-level criminal offences. (Often, much larger fines are used alongside jail sentences for ‘white-collar’ crimes, e.g. fraud, but these are less relevant to the debate in hand.)

In some places, (e.g. Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and some other European countries 1,2) fines are given relative to the offender’s income: so if you earn more, you pay a larger fine. Ordinarily, there is a minimum fine, with an additional ‘day fine’ or ‘unit fine’ above that amount, where the offender is fined a given number of days-worth of income. 3

This debate is, in essence about two things. First, a question of justice, and how we create a system that is fair for all, and second, how we create a system that is likely to lead to the best outcomes (in terms of deterring people from criminal behaviour).
