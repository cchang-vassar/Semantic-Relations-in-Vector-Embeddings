In 2007, after the announcement of the Party of National Unity’s Mwai Kibaki as winner of the Kenyan presidential election, supporters of the Orange Democratic Movement’s Raila Odinga contested the results. Violence stemming from protests, largely along ethnic lines, caused 1,500 deaths and 600,000 displacements. The Kenyan government launched the Waki commission, which recommended a special tribunal, [1] which was politically rejected in Kenya, leading to the commission to send evidence to the ICC. Six people were indicted by the ICC in 2011, including William Ruto and Uhuru Kenyatta.

The allegations against William Samoei Ruto and another defendant, Joshua arap Sang, is that they sought to ethnically cleanse the Kikuyu, Kamba and Kisii racial groups, who were seen as pro-PNU, from certain areas – Sang, a radio presenter, using his show to incite violence. Their trial commenced on the 10th of September 2013. The allegations against Uhuru Kenyatta are that he funded a banned gang, in order to keep the PNU in power at all costs, leading to deaths of civilians, rapes and ethnic cleansing.

Despite this, in April 2013, Kenyatta and Ruto were elected as President and Vice President of Kenya respectively. In September 2013, al-Shabaab, a Somali based Islamist terror group, preformed a gun and grenade attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi, leading to 72 deaths. The need for a response lead to an upsurge in sympathy and support with the Kenyan government, and strengthened calls for the trials of Ruto, which was already underway, and Kenyatta, which was due to start, to be postponed.

The Kenyan government, with support from the African Union, is attempting to stop the trial from going ahead. The trial of Ruto commenced in September 2013, with the Kenyatta trial scheduled to start on February 2014, following delays to allow Kenyatta to govern in response to the Westgate massacre.

Should the ICC hold off prosecuting Kenyatta and Ruto until their terms as president and deputy president respectively end in 2018? Kenyatta and Ruto could be re-elected for further five year terms.
