In 1976, the District of Columbia City Council banned the possession of handguns not already possessed and registered by residents, and the use of any gun for self-defense. On March 9th, 2007, in District of Columbia v. Heller , a federal appeals court overturned the District of Columbia's ban. It was considered by MSNBC to be "the most important ruling on gun control in 70 years" 1, largely because it rejected the city’s argument that the Second Amendment right to bear arms applied only to militias. The case soon came before the Supreme Court. On March 18th, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court convened a hearing to listen to arguments made by attorneys to either uphold the ban or to declare it unconstitutional.

Many of the arguments in this debate relate directly to interpretation of the Second Amendment to the constitution of the United States of America: "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to bear Arms, shall not be infringed."

A number of questions frame the debate on the Second Amendment. Is it important in the modern day to offer citizens a right to gun ownership for the purpose of protecting against government tyranny? Would handguns be a necessary part of this check against an excessively powerful state? What kinds of arms are necessary to an individual's ability to defend themselves and their family? Are handguns necessary? Do arms, and the right to bear them, increase violence, crime, and murder rates. Does a right to bear arms generally decrease public safety? Or, does an entitlement to carry handguns empower good citizens to take action against, "check", and generally deter bad citizens from committing crimes? Are handguns particularly conducive to gang violence because they are concealable? Or does the wide availability of firearms deter gangsters (creating a fear and uncertainty among criminals that good citizens are carrying them)? Are DC's circumstances exceptional? Does its history of crime and violence warrant exceptional measures such as a handgun ban? Does its status as the nation's capital also mean that exceptional cautions must be taken?

In this debate, proposition should seek to propose a motion that implements a ban similar to the original 1976 prohibition – restricting the sale and possession of handguns that are not already registered to a particular owner. They can choose to implement a system where remaining guns are phased out over time with some measure of gun amnesty. (A process where the remaining guns are given anonymously to the police). It is important to note that opposition arguments along the line that the ban would be unconstitutional do not stand up in British Parliamentary debating, unless significant harm from changing the constitution can be proved. This is because British parliamentary debating assumes that the legislation will pass without hindrance should proposition win and that measures to allow this will be implemented. As such a change in the constitution to make the handgun ban legal is assumed to be possible under the terms of the debate. Consequently, proposition’s burden in this debate is to show that such a ban would be beneficial and justifiable, not to show that it would be constitutional.
