Africa’s large animals are well documented in history. Elephants were a source of great fear in the ancient African armies and they became a source of fascination for Europeans. When they began to explore and colonise the continent, the hides, horns, tusks and pelts of Africa’s wildlife became valuable trophies. [1]

Unfortunately, hunting and destruction of their environments has led to the extinction of many species, such as the Quagga and the Western black rhinoceros, and has left others critically endangered. There are over 350 critically endangered species in Africa, including African elephants, lions and rhinoceroses. To ensure the survival of these animals, nature reserves were established as early as 1898. With a focus on conservation, it became illegal to hunt or destroy the environment of the endangered species which lived on the reserve. [2] Hunting of these animals was officially recognised as ‘poaching’, making it a punishable activity.

Since the beginning of the 21 st century however, the numbers of these animals has nosedived. Tanzania’s elephant population has decreased from 109,419 elephants in 1976 to 13,084 in 2014. [3] This has led to increased calls for a tougher approach towards the protection of endangered animals. This mainly suggests a militarised response, but can also include higher levels of passive protection (fencing areas off) and increased punishment in the justice system. Whether or not a tougher approach will work has become an issue of contention, illustrated by the responses to Tanzanian minister Khamis Kagaski’s call to execute poachers “on the spot”. [4]
