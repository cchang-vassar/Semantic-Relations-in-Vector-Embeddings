Global Climate Change, formally referred to as global warming, is the largest threat facing the long term survival of the human species. The leading authority on climate change is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific intergovernmental body tasked with reviewing and assessing the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change. Although debates in the media still rage over the causes of climate change, today the majority of climate scientists believe that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), of which carbon dioxide (CO2) is the best known, are building up in the atmosphere causing global temperatures to slowly rise. The continued rise of atmospheric GHGs (measured in parts per million [PPM] of CO2 equivalent) may have catastrophic consequences for earth and its inhabitants. While some people hold out hope that new government policy, new technology, and/or greater individual action will reverse the pattern of rising annual GHG emissions, others are less optimistic and believe that by the time humanity recognizes the true costs of climate change, it will be too late mitigate the consequences.
