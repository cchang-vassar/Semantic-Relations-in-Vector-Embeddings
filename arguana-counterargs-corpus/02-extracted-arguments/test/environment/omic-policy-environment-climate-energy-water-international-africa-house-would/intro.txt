The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is one of the poorest and most war torn countries in the world. Yet it is also a country with immense natural wealth, not least of which is the great Congo river itself. The Congo river is a river of superlatives, one of the biggest in the world it is 4700km long with a drainage basin of 4million km2 and a discharge of 41,000 m 3/sec. [1] The Congo river is also unique in having rapids in its lower course. These rapids for centuries made the interior of the region impenetrable to outsiders now they provide an opportunity for hydroelectric power which relies upon being able to use water and gravity to drive turbines and create electricity. The Congo at Inga drops 96 Meters over 14.5Km of waterfalls and rapids. [2]

There are already two dams at the Inga falls and a third on the way. Inga I and II were constructed during the rule of dictator Mobutu along with the Inga-Shaba high voltage power lines completed in 1982. These grand projects brought Zaire (as it was then called) deeply into debt despite the power being meant to allow investment in natural resources. [3] Inga III is currently under construction and will produce 4,800 MW of electricity without much disruption to the river as the river won’t be closed off and no tunnels built. Inga III might be said to be stage I of the Grand Inga dam even though it will be able to operate independently. [4]

The biggest project is the proposed $50 billion Grand Inga dam which would generate up to 40,000MW. It is a ‘run-of-river’ project in which water is siphoned off the main flow of the river before going through turbines to get back into the main channel. In the case of the Grand Inga this means flooding side valleys at a bend in the river. The advantage is that the main course of the river is left unaltered. [5] Despite this it is clearly an immense project that will provoke opposition from environmental activists and questions about the DRC’s ability to manage such a project.
