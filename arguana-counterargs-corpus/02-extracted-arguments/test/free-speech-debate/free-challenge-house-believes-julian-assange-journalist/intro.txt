The case: Julian Assange: a journalist?

In February 2010, Wikileaks , a clandestine whistleblower outlet, released the first in a series of classified US state department cables. The documents, which came from 274 US consulates and embassies around the world, contained confidential reports (at times, extremely unflattering) on host countries and their leaders. They are alleged to have been leaked by former US army officer Bradley Manning. (He has been tried for the offence, and is awaiting a verdict.) Eventually, over 250,000 cables were made public, in the world’s largest-ever release of classified material. By the end of 2010, the cables had been published widely in the press, as part of a deal between Wikileaks and five major newspapers. US Defence Secretary Robert Gates deemed the document dump “ extraordinarily embarrassing ”. Others preferred the term “national security threat”.

The episode – which has since been dubbed “Cablegate” (a reference to the 1970s Watergate scandal) – made Julian Assange a celebrity. But did it make him a journalist? That question is now the crux of a pressing debate: about who qualifies as a “journalist” and what constitutes “journalism” in the internet age. If Assange is a journalist, he receives certain rights that many states extend to that professional group. In the US, for instance, reporters who receive information from government sources enjoy a number of privileges, and often protection, under the first amendment. Yet if Assange is not a journalist, he is on his own – and not protected by press freedoms. In the US, this debate about where to draw professional boundaries is an old one. (Recall the “ Pentagon Papers ” leak of 1971.) But it has recently taken on new urgency, with a number of US prosecutors demanding that Assange be tried in court for his involvement in Cablegate”.

Critics charge that “dumping” documents online is not part of the journalistic enterprise. Instead, they call Assange a “source”. The most extreme opponents have branded Wikileaks a terrorist organization – a far cry from a news outlet. (Former US vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin puts Assange on a par with al-Qaida.) But groups like the Centre for Investigative Journalism recognise Assange as one of their own. And many first amendment attorneys and American commentators agree with that classification, arguing that “the lines distinguishing professional journalists from other people who disseminate information, ideas and opinions to a wider audience have largely disappeared with the advent of the Web.”

(Assange himself prefers the title “publisher and editor-in-chief who organises and directs other journalists”.)

Katie Engelhart’s opinion

Julian Assange is a journalist, and should be treated as such. The current debate rests on an archaic definition of the journalist and the news organisation, which has not adapted to the age of citizen journalists, tweets, leaks, links and re-posts. We should expand our concept of what makes a “journalist” – and thus, who can take shelter under the umbrella of “media”. We may need to interrogate the lines between “speaker’, “disseminator”, “source” and “reporter” of knowledge.

Otherwise, we risk obstructing the new media’s use of government sources. And we risk applying the law in a lopsided fashion. Consider this: if we agree to prosecute Assange – for endangering national security by leaking confidential government information – should we not also prosecute the editors of The New York Times, Der Spiegel and the other traditional news outlets that re-published Wikileaks material?

On the other hand, we could draw the very valid conclusion that these flagship newspapers are already bound by editorial guidelines, ethics standards and professional journalism practices: like verification, fact-checking, placing in context, and anonymising names of those in danger. In other words, these newspapers act professionally – and it is that which earns them the kinds of protection extended to other professional groups, such as lawyers and doctors. If Wikileaks does not act in accordance with journalistic standards, should it be able to seek refuge under journalistic privileges?
