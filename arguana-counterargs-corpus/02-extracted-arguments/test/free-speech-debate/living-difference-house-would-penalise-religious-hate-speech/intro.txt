The case: The preacher against homosexuality

In October 2001, an Evangelical Christian preacher called Harry Hammond started preaching in a square in Bournemouth, England. He held up a placard saying, “Stop Immorality, Stop Homosexuality, Stop Lesbianism.” The words “Jesus is Lord” were inscribed on each corner. An angry crowd gathered around him, arguing, shouting and even throwing soil at him. At one point, someone tried to pull away his placard, causing him to fall backwards [1] .

When Hammond refused to stop, a policeman arrested him. He was subsequently convicted of an offence under Section 5 of Britain’s Public Order Act 1986, which forbids the display of “any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby”. The conviction was upheld on appeal , on the grounds that Hammond’s words were “insulting”, although the appeal court noted that the sign’s message was “not expressed in intemperate language”.

Timothy Garton Ash’s opinion

“This conviction was quite wrong. Hammond was expressing his beliefs. These are offensive to many of us, but in a free and diverse society, no one has a right not to be offended. He was not inciting violence. The policeman should have warned and if need be arrested the person using force to pull the placard away from the preacher – not the preacher himself. By tackling the wrong man the police officer was encouraging what in the US is called “the heckler’s veto”. Shout loudly enough, with menace, and you can close down legitimate debate. This is a textbook example of how the law should not be used.”

- Timothy Garton Ash
