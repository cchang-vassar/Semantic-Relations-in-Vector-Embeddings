The Case: Jerry Springer &amp; Blasphemous libel

BBC television’s broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera in January 2005 was met with protests by Christian groups. Speaking to the BBC, one protester said, “There should be freedom of speech but there should never be freedom for desecration.” A record 63,000 people complained about the programme’s use of profanity and “blasphemous” script; many before the broadcast. Reports place the number of swearwords, including fuck and cunt, at around 400 while the cast of characters includes a nappy-wearing Jesus who confesses he is “a bit gay”.

Three days after the broadcast, radio producer Antony Pitts resigned, saying the BBC had flouted its own guidelines and brushed off complaints. BBC director-general Mark Thompson stood by the corporation’s decision: “I am a practicing Christian, but there is nothing in this which I believe to be blasphemous.”

One organisation, Christian Voice, failed in its efforts to sue the BBC for blasphemous libel after two High Court judges ruled that broadcasters and theatres could not be prosecuted under this offence. They added that as a parody of Jerry Springer, the US chat show, and not of Christianity, the programme could not be deemed blasphemous.

Maryam Omidi’s opinion

I emphatically agree with the BBC’s decision to broadcast Jerry Springer: The Opera. The BBC was right to think that the programme, which was based on the award-winning British musical of the same name, would be of great interest to its viewers. As a public service broadcaster, the BBC has an obligation to broadcast programmes that appeal to a diverse audience. The 63,000 people who complained were a fraction of the 24 million-odd licence-fee payers in 2005.

Furthermore, the corporation gave sufficient warning about the programme’s strong language and religious content before it was aired – anyone who felt uncomfortable with the subject matter could choose not watch it. The fact that thousands complained before the programme was broadcast, also points to the often knee-jerk reaction to religious themes deemed offensive. Most of the burners of Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses had reportedly not even read the book . The case study also raises another interesting question: if the parody concerned Islamic rather than Christian themes, would the BBC have broadcast the programme?
