The case: Can Christians wear the cross at work?

Two Christian women, Nadia Eweida and Shirley Chaplin, appealed to the European Court of Human Rights after being barred by employers from wearing the cross at work. Since both discrimination cases were lost in the UK courts in 2010, the two Christians sought redress under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The article provides a right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion , which includes a person’s “freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance”.

Eweida was placed on unpaid leave by British Airways for not covering up a necklace depicting a Christian cross. British Airways argued that the wearing of a crucifix falls under their general uniform regulation of not allowing jewellery. In a separate case, Shirley Chaplin, who works as a nurse in the UK, was moved to a desk job upon refusing to remove her crucifix. The NHS trust’s uniform policy, which Shirley Chaplin works under, bans necklaces for frontline staff on the grounds that they may be grabbed by patients. The UK government argued against both Christians’ appeal to the Strasbourg court on the grounds that wearing the cross is not a “requirement of the faith” and therefore not covered by European human rights legislation.

Dominic Burbidge’s opinion

Compared with other treatments of religious expression, these two cases of Christians trying to wear crosses in the workplace seem out of step. Though the two cases were lost in the UK courts, special status has been granted for the Sikh turban and kara bracelet, and the Muslim hijab. Even if sufficient grounds can be found for the cross being a dangerous piece of jewellery in the workplace, the cases were clearly unnecessarily politicised by the UK government’s stance. Should government be the body to define what forms of expression are necessary requirements of a faith? Christianity is a diverse religious body, with some members arguing against any symbols whilst others, for example Coptic Christians (such as, Eweida), place greater value on the right to symbols and public expression. Government defining what counts as a religious requirement invites accusations that its decisions have been arbitrary, theologically ignorant and trying to satisfy only those groups who might back their rights with civil disorder.
