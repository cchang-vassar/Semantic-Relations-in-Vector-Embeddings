The case study: Censoring hip-hop music in London

“Guns, bitches and bling were never part of the four elements of hip hop and never will be.” Scroobius Pip, ‘Thou Shalt Always Kill’

Recurrent themes in discussions on popular culture are the origins and impact of violent imagery and music. Outlandish, atavistic and brutal content seems to be a naturally occurring part of imagined and narrative culture. All societies experience violent conduct, many societies tell stories involving violence, and most societies are likely produce cultural expressions that glamorise violence in some way.

Debates over the content and censorship of these forms of media have become increasingly prominent as mass production and communication technologies have enabled books, songs and images to be circulated to ever wider audiences.

During the last two decades, the musical genre known as hip hop has found itself at the forefront of this debate. Throughout the 1980s a trend towards realist lyrics that reflected the poverty and dispossession of the black communities from which hip hop emerged led to the creation of the “gangsta” rap genre, which fixated on gang violence and drug consumption. Feuds between commercially successful rappers during the 1990s culminated in shootings and deaths. Links between hip hop music and violence in inner city areas remain largely unexamined. However, hip hop’s apologists point out that gangs and crime are more closely linked to poverty and poor policing than to rap lyrics.

In January this year, a large “urban” music event in south London was disrupted when police officers conducted searches of eighteen performers and a number of young people, looking for concealed weapons. Such searches are justified by the terms of a risk assessment form- a “696”- that organisers of events in London venues must complete and submit to the police, at the risk of losing their licence. The form requires organisers to state the type of music being performed at their event. Up until 2008 the form asked organisers to give “demographic” details of an event’s likely audience, including their age and race.

“Proposals of this type often tend to focus on one particular musical genre. In the case of the example above, the genre targeted for increased regulation is hip hop. Many critics, from both inside and outside the hip hop industry have noted its increased focus on themes of gang violence, misogyny and aggressive materialism.

Those at the most extreme end of the critical spectrum claim that feuds between hip hop artists demonstrate that it is an art form that trades exclusively in images of cynical brutality, and that by equating thuggish behaviour with a glamorous lifestyle, it encourages other individuals to act in a similar way. As noted above, this viewpoint is often used to make the case that hip hop’s fans are likely to engage in criminal behaviour.

The use of 696 forms to shut down urban music events or to justify intensified policing at concerts touches directly on many of the issues contained in principle 1. Plainly, closing down a musical event based on a tenuous connection between the style of the music that will be performed and the behaviour of the audience is denial of self-expression. Crucially, however, the disproportionate targeting of hip hop and associated musical forms by the police, taken alongside comments made by high ranking politicians such as David Cameron also suggests that it is seen as an inferior form of speech, one that can be freely censored and displaced because it contains no socially valuable content.

The capstone of this misleading approach to the sometimes violent and controversial content of hip hop music is the attitude of public authorities to those who consume and produce it. Broadcasters of hip hop music have been accused of encouraging knife crime and violent muggings; stickers advising ‘Parental Guidance’ are regularly attached to hip hop albums. At the height of civil unrest in London during 2011 the prominent historian David Starky commented that ‘A particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion,’ and that ‘Black and white, boy and girl operate in this language together. This language, which is wholly false, which is this Jamaican patois that has intruded in England [sic].’

The result of such comments is the demonization of hip hop artists and the infantilisation of their fans. Both these trends are effective in obstructing free speech. Once again, they deny the veracity and authenticity of a particular type of free expression under the aegis of protecting the public from criminality. In addition, such comments seek to portray the audiences that hip hop attracts as gullible and overly impressionable, adding an additional stereotype to a constellation of already damaging assumptions.

Reactionary attempts to shut down music venues and censor hip hop are no replacement for an equitable and even handed assessment of the content of hip hop music. Violence, even in its glamorised form, will always be part of popular culture, but it is telling that we only begin to find it objectionable when it threatens to bring the problems and realities of life at the margins of society into the mainstream – when fictional glamour reflects too closely on real-life social breakdown.”
