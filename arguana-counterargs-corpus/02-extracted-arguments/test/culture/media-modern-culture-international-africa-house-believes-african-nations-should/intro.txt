In our globalized world with an increasingly international media, beauty standards for both men and women are becoming more internationalized - or, perhaps, Westernized. This has included skin tone, with cultural values in many countries favouring lighter skin tones.

One particular aspect of this has been creams aiming to whiten skin. This is not an issue that affects women, the key target of much of the fashion and beauty industry, exclusively - some products are aimed at men. This is not a phenomenon unique to Africa and communities of African origins. India is a large market for skin whitening creams, with a market worth just shy of half a billion US dollars in 2010 and growing at nearly 20% per year [1] . In Hong Kong, around a third of women have used such products [2] . The issue of people seeking to look “whiter” or Caucasian is not limited to any area or simply skin whitening creams – there are also products and the possibility of surgery to mimic more European-looking eyelids available in East Asia [3] . West Africa is a key market for these products, with over half of women in Togo and Nigeria claiming to use them. While some contain chemicals aimed at modifying the skin’s transfer of melanin, others use harsh chemicals such as mercury, which can lead to medical conditions from eczema and infections to renal failure [4] .A particular controversy has been generated by the launch of a new skin whitening product in early 2014, known as “Whitenicious”, by Nigerian-Cameroonian singer Dencia [5] , and her comments relating to the product, including a spat with actress Lupita Nyong’o [6] . Nyong’o, who shot to fame outside her native Kenya following her powerful performance in the popular and well received British-American film “12 Years A Slave [7] ”, has been critical of skin lightening creams and the conception of lighter skin tones in African mind-sets [8] . In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration proposed a ban on over-the-counter sales of skin whitening creams [9] . Is this a solution for Africa?
