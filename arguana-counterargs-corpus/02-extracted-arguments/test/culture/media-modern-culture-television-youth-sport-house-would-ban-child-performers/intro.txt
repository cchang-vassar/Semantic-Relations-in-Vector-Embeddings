The term child performer includes young singers, actors, dancers, gymnasts, etc. These children are exceptions to the 1973 Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, and so may be paid for their work, as long as they have permits that “limit the number of hours during which and prescribe the conditions in which employment or work is allowed”. [1] However, some feel that child performers ought not to be such an exception, and that it should be ensured that no child under the minimum age for admission to employment be allowed to partake in paid work of any kind.

Currently, child performers are protected by various laws, for example laws which dictate how many hours the child may work and how much education they must receive (both of which vary by country), or how much of their pay must be reserved for the child themselves (e.g., Canada’s “Coogan Law”). Yet some believe these laws do not provide adequate protection, and that these child performers represent a group (and a group which is on the increase) [2] whose rights are being undermined. A subset believes that the only way to protect these children completely is to ban child performers outright.
