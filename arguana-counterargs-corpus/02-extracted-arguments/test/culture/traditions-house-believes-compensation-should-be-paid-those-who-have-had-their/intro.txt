Recently, many celebrities and companies have been accused of 'cultural appropriation'. Famous examples of this include: Miley Cyrus' use of 'twerking', a dance move rooted in African traditions; Urban Outfitters use of the Native American tribe 'Navajo' on products; and lingerie franchise Victoria's Secret’s use of a Native American war bonnet on the runway. The result of these 'scandals' have often resulted in an apology or retraction of products, but some people are calling for reparations which may be better for all concerned.

The term 'cultural appropriation' first emerged in the last twenty years of the 20th century. According to Oxford reference, the term ‘cultural appropriation’ describes the overtaking of ‘creative or artistic forms, practices or themes by one cultural group from another’. Generally, the term is used to describe ‘Western appropriations of non-western or non-white forms, and carries connotations with exploitation or dominance’ [1]. Fordham University Law professor and author of 'Who Owns Culture?: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law' Susan Scafidi, explains cultural appropriation as ‘’Taking intellectual property, traditional knowledge, cultural expressions or artefacts from someone else’s culture without permission’’. In more detail, this can include ‘’unauthorized use of another culture’s dance, dress, music, language, folklore, cuisine, traditional medicine, religious symbols, etc. It’s most likely to be harmful when the source community is a minority group that has been oppressed or exploited in other ways or when the object of appropriation is particularly sensitive, e.g. sacred objects’’ [2].

As shown above, there is no unanimous definition of the term 'cultural appropriation'. Likewise, the term 'culture' can be defined in different ways. It is a complex term which has collected many definitions over time but for the purpose of this debate, we will use two definitions. According to Parson and Shils, culture is comprised of a set of norms, values and symbols that guide the behavior of an individual [3]. This definition assumes that culture influences individual people more than a collection of individuals forming and shaping culture. In 1955, Herskovits argued that "there is a general agreement that culture is learned; that it allows man to adopt himself to his natural and social setting; that it is greatly variable; that it is manifested in institutions, thought patterns, and material objects" [4]. In addition to this, culture can be seen as a problem-solving tool. Moran and Stripp define culture as "a group problem-solving tools that enables individuals to survive in a particular environment" [5]. This shows culture to be a thing that comes with human nature, evolution. Just as humans evolve, so does culture as it is used as a coping mechanism and tool for survival.

Why compensation?

Compensation is a form of reparations which is understood to 'Include any quantifiable damage resulting from the crime'. This typically consists of but is not limited to 'physical or mental harm, including pain. Suffering and emotional distress; lost opportunities, including education; material damages and loss of earnings, including loss of potential; harm to reputation or dignity'.[6]

In a time of globalization and the threat this poses to native cultures it is important to discuss how those cultures can be protected and preserved. Discussion of compensation for the use of culturally appropriated ideas is a part of this.
