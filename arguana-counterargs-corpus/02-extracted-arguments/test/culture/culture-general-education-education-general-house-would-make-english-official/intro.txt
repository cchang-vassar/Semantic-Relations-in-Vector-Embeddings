The United States declared independence in 1776 against what it saw as the overweening power of the British crown regarding taxes, regulations, and representation. Since that time, Americans have resisted anything that smacks of government enforced conformity. The United States at its founding was “secular”, and it did not even have a national anthem until 1931, when the Star Spangled Banner was adopted.

As a consequence, despite the fact that English is almost uniformly used as the language of culture, government, and commerce, the United States has no codified official language.

In recent years this has become something of an issue. Much of this change is linked to the spread of the Spanish language as millions of immigrants from Latin America have moved to the United States and an industry of Spanish television stations and services has grown up to cater to them.

In reaction there has been a push to place on the ballot referendums to declare English the official language in several states. These referendums have generally appeared fairly harmless to most voters, and have tended to pass overwhelmingly, with even liberal Massachusetts passing theirs in a vote which also banned bilingual education with 83% of the vote.

Proponents have focused on a perceived lack of integration, and the major target of ire has been English as a Second Language (ESL) education in Public Schools. It is argued that by allowing children of immigrants to take classes in their native language the government is actively encouraging immigration.

These amendments of course do not have to be packaged with bans on bilingual education (though they often have been). Where it is not the focus is on identity, and history, with opponents arguing that English is not threatened.
