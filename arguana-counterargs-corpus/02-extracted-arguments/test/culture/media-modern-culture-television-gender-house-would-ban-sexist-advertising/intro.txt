As concern for gender equality continues around the world, so do the concerns in how women and children are portrayed and perceived in an ever increasing international media. Since advertising carries those messages, images of women continue to come under scrutiny. In May of 2011, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly received a report from its Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Children which discussed the nature of this problem and called for action regarding sexist advertising. These portrayals of women are believed by opponents to sexist advertising to present unrealistic beauty standards and often objectify women. These opponents argue stereotypic images are contributing to harmful effects such as eating disorders and violence against women. One primary focus in this dialogue is whether responses should be made which interfere with business practices. What is the nature of the marketplace? Should business be monitored and censured? How or could appropriate criteria for judgement be established?

Advertising is the promotion of good and services through public messages. Sexism can be defined as discrimination based on gender or attitudes which promote stereotyping of social roles based on gender. Sexist advertising, then, is the promotion of goods or services which stereotype women and men based on gender. Banning refers to the public restriction of a particular action to achieve a desired goal.
