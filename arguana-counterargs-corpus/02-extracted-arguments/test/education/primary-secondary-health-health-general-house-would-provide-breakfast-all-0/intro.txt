Breakfast, the first meal of the day is a vitally important especially for school students, yet in deprived neighbourhoods there are many who go to school hungry. This debate proposes to end this by having schools provide a meal for every one of their pupils at the start of each day. The government would pay for this in all non-fee paying schools. Those schools that charge fees would have to implement the policy themselves but this would usually simply mean a small increase in fees so would have little impact. This debate is often restricted just to primary or elementary school students but there is little reason why the arguments cannot apply to secondrary school students as well.

Variations on this suggestion are done around the world. In the UK a policy that gave free school meals to the poorest was expanded to reach 1.9million, all children of ages 4 to 7 years old in 2014. [1] Free school meals are also provided in Sweden, Finland, and Estonia. [2] Providing breakfast for free is even rarer as school is usually deemed to have started after breakfast time. The United States has a School Breakfast Program however it is not universal and is not always free rather, it is free for those whose families are on incomes under 130% of the poverty rate and subsidised for those between 130% and 185%.

Note: this is a debate for Debate in the Neighbourhood; we have kept the arguments short and simple following the SEXI model. In your debate you may well have much more personal examples than those here.
