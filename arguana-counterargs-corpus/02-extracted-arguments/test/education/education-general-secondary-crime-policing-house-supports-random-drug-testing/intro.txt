In a landmark ruling, the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Vernonia School District v. Acton that schools could randomly test student athletes for drug use, after a student, James Acton, was banned from trialling for his school football team without consenting to a test [1] . The legal battle for the school’s right to drug-test has gained and lost ground for many years in the USA; in 1998 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Todd v. Rush County Schools upheld an Indiana school board program that banned students from participation in extracurricular activities without first passing a random drugs test. This was however later struck down as being against state constitutional law. [2] And in 2001 the Tenth Circuit in Willis v. Anderson Community School Corporation ruled that tests imposed unreasonable searches upon students in violation of Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. [3]

A study conducted in the United Kingdom in 2004 by the Independent Inquiry into Drug Testing at Work found that attempts by employers to force employees to take drug tests could potentially be challenged as a violation of privacy under the UK Human Rights Act and Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. [4]

This debate should focus on society’s desire to combat what it perceives as a growing drug abuse problem, pitted against children and families’ right to privacy. Tests can be conducted on urine, hair, breath or occasionally blood.
