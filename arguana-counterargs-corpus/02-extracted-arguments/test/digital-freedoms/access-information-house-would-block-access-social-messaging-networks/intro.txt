With the birth of social media people have become instantly connected to each other, and have been able to gain access to news and information with incredible rapidity. That new access has given groups unprecedented power to organize. On the dark side of all this is the use of these tools by rioters and looters to coordinate their efforts.

Yet the use of social media is not confined to those who act within the rule of law. It can equally be used to organise riots or violence where there are alternative methods of protesting. Twitter, Facebook, and Blackberry Messenger were all used extensively in the riots in London and Manchester in August 2011 in much the same way as they had been used as an organising tool in the revolutions. While Twitter and Facebook were both used the nature of the rioting meant that Blackberry messenger was much more useful; it is much more private and importantly for a potential rioter not traceable back to the user’s phone. It could be used to rapidly bring groups ready for violence to particular areas so enabling rioters to outmanoeuvre the police. [1]

The rioting lead to calls for social media to be more tightly regulated and policed. The British Prime Minister David Cameron called for suspected rioters to be banned from social networks and demanded greater effort for the social media giants to remove content that incites violence. He also suggested the more radical proposal that if a riot was in progress the police should have the power to shut down a social network in a localised area to reduce the rioters’ ability to organise. [2]

Since the use of social networks for coordination in riots is through mobile phones and devices the government would potentially be using powers, such as Britain’s Mobile Telecommunication Privileged Access Scheme, that can be used to shut down individual base stations so that the effect would be localised. [3] However it may potentially be necessary to shut down a whole network as Mubarak ultimately did in Egypt. [4]
