The advent of computing has allowed governments, businesses and individuals to store, collate, analyse, and utilize huge amounts of data. Firms have made use of this power to store the personal data of their customers in order to better understand them and to cater to their needs. Others have even used the data online to offer targeted marketing aimed at the personal profiles of individuals, often created by way of information gleaned from cookies, search histories, etc. that give them a window on the sorts of people using their services. Sometimes even phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses are sold in this way. Databrokers such as ChoicePoint and Acxiom purchase data from many sources, including government agencies, businesses, credit bureaus and investigators. They then offer “analytical services” on millions of households. This collation and utilization of data has spawned a secondary market in which firms have sold on their compiled data on individuals to other companies seeking to better understand the marketplace and to find consumers for their products. It is a booming $300 billion-a-year industry. [1]

This vast increase in the dissemination and use of individuals’ private data has resulted in extensive debates across the world, and has spawned many laws, that mandate privacy controls and strict regulation of how this information is used. However as the gathering and use of data rapidly changes the law often struggles to keep up. The European Union for example is in the process of reforming its Data Protection rules that it implemented in 1995. [2] The debate is a serious one, because at its heart is the question of what information people use in their commercial dealings should be accessible permanently by firms and which can actually be distributed to someone willing to pay for. For those who wish to prevent companies from collecting this information this represents a serious violation of privacy and runs the risk of data being misused by firms, and misappropriated by even less savoury institutions, such as hackers. Their opponents, particularly business, on the other hand contend that the efficiency and targeting gains generated by this information-gathering has allowed firms to offer more and better services to consumers, enriching their lives.

The following debate addresses all these issues, focusing on the ethics of the data storage and whether in fact it can lead to meaningfully better outcomes both for consumers and companies.
