File sharing, for the purposes of this debate, is providing access to or getting access to software, video, music or other media files for free that you would normally have to pay for. File sharing outside of the control of the copyright holder has become a major problem for media companies who blame it for lost revenues as their content is illegally copied and shared over the internet reducing the demand for the legal product. ‘Graduated response’, sometimes also called ‘three strikes’, is a policy copyright holders are calling for to combat online copyright infringement. Graduated response means that copyright holders would use automated technical means to monitor the activities of internet users, for example via surveillance of forums and blogs, posing as file sharers in peer-to-peer networks or via an automatic copyright filter applied to internet traffic (‘fingerprinting’ of ‘watermarking’). If a copyright infringement is detected, the copyright holder will collect the Internet Protocol address (IP-address, the address your internet service provider uses to identify your computer) and then report the infringer’s IP-address to its internet service provider (ISP). The ISP will then warn the owner of the IP-address. After they have been warned a certain number of times, the ISP can terminate or suspend the subscriber’s internet connection, or send a fine for copyright infringement.

This casefile focusses on the specific policy of graduated response, and only minimally deals with the larger ethical/legal question whether downloading copyrighted content from an unauthorized source should be considered illegal.
