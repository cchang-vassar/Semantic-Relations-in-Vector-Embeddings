The topic of tolerance towards religious symbols has caused much controversy among many both in the Western and Eastern hemispheres. Religious symbols are incorporated into every religion and are expressions of both faith and devotion. Examples of religious symbols include the Christian, particularly Catholic, Crucifix, the Muslim Hijab and the Sikh Kirpan. For many people, particularly from the West, the Hijab or Muslim head covering symbolises the repressive and extremely regressive character of Islam. However, for its supporters, it represents the defence of women's modesty against the assault of modern society. In this way, religious symbols and their meanings and consequences differ depending on cultural perception. Recent controversy has arisen around France's plan to ban the Hijab, along with other visible religious symbols, in schools. France's secular constitution provides the grounds for excluding religion from their schools. However it is not just western countries who have taken this approach. Turkey has for many years suppressed the Hijab in schools, public buildings and among employees of the state. In the aftermath of 9/11, many minority Muslim communities in western countries view attacks on the Hijab as part of a wider attack on Islam conducted in tandem with the 'War on Terror'. In a similar way, there is anxiety as to the freedom to bring Sikh Kirpans' to school because they are ceremonial daggers. It should be noted that the Sikh religion requires the Kirpan to carried with the Sikh at all times. In this way, the practice of the religion is seen to be restricted and can, therefore, be possibly considered as discrimination. However, there are other forms of religious symbolism that are not necessarily a requirement of the religion and are merely an expression of faith. There was recent controversy over a British woman who lost her job simply because she continued wearing a Crucifix after she was told not to by her employers. All of these points present an interesting question. Should authorities be more lenient on religious symbols that are a requirement of the person? Also, should there be a limit to physical or material expressions of faith?
