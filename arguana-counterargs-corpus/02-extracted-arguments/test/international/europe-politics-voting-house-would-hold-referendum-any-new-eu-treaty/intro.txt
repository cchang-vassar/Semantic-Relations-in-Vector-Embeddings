The European Union (EU) is the economic and political partnership of 27 member states, primarily based in Europe. Based on precedence set from treaties signed in the wake of the Second World War, the European Union established itself under its current title in 1993. Since this time it has grown in size and undergone several constitutional changes, most notably the Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force in 2009. Up until now the process through which proposed amendments are accepted has not been uniform. For example a draft Constitution drawn up in amended form at a European Summit in June 2004 caused a divide when some countries ratified the treaty through national parliaments while others opted for a referendum within their country. As a result the Treaty was rejected by popular vote in France and the Netherlands, and abandoned. In October 2007 the idea was again resurrected in the Lisbon Treaty that proposed similar reforms to the draft Constitution in order to streamline the workings of the European Union. However unlike the Reform Treaty, when the Lisbon Treaty needed to be ratified many member states including UK, Poland and the Czech Republic that had previously decided on holding a referendum passed the Treaty through national parliaments, leaving only Ireland and Denmark committed to holding a referendum on these important constitutional changes. In France and the Netherlands the decision to not repeat the public vote was broadly accepted, in spite of the previous no vote. However in Britain Gordon Brown's decision to not hold a referendum was met with heavy criticism. Proponents of holding a referendum for constitutional changes to the EU suggest that such important changes, which affect national sovereignty, need to be ratified by public vote in order to remain democratic. However opponents argue that referendums are ineffective and that the public know little about EU constitutional issues and therefore would not vote effectively. This debate will not cover whether or not reform itself is beneficial, but only the vehicle through which reform should be agreed upon.
