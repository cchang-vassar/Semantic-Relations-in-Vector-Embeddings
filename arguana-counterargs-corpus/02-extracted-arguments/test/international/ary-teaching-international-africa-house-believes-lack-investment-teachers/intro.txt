Millennium Development Goal 2 targeted inequalities in primary education - setting an agenda of equality in opportunities to achieve universal primary education, for girls and boys, by 2015. In response to the development hype enrolment rates have increased across the developing world and disparities in literacy rates narrowed. The target is expected to be met in Northern Africa, by 2015, however, in Sub-Saharan Africa while there have been moderate gains progress has stalled making it questionable whether the target will be made a reality. Over half of the children not in school are in Sub-Saharan Africa (UN, 2013).

Achieving universal primary education has centred on tackling issues on enrolment - particularly gender based inequalities to recognise the equal right to education, completion of primary school, and improving literacy rates. This debate therefore turns to a focus on teachers - a vital resource in achieving and fundamentally sustaining, the goal. Rising protests by teachers, in Tanzania (2012), Zimbabwe (2014), and South Africa (2013), indicates the sense of dissatisfaction amongst current teachers. Further, low student-teacher ratios identify the growing reality of overcrowded schools. Can efforts be placed on encouraging enrolment if the teachers who provide teaching are inadequate, unmotivated, and underfunded?

The scale of the teaching problem requires recognition. The focus is on teachers across the education sector - from primary to universities. This debate returns to discussion on how the right to education can be achieved; and what models of investment need to be encouraged. Currently funds are diverted to building infrastructure and rapid training for teachers, failing to integrate social policy schemes for teachers and ensuring the quality of education for students.
