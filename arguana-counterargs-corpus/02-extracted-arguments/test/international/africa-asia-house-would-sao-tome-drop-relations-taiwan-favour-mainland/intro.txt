There is only one China, but which is it? There are two Chinas, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan) but because both accept there is only one China all states need to decide which they recognise as China.

At the end of the Second World War there were two main factions in China; the Communists (CPC) under Mao Tse-tung and the Nationalists (KMT) of Chang Kai-shek. These two groups had already been fighting prior to the interruption of their conflict by the Japanese invasion of China. Despite some cooperation during the second world war the civil war resumed in 1946 soon after Japan was defeated. The Communist Chinese won several important victories in 1948-9 and captured the KMT capital Nanjing. On December 10 th 1949 Chang retreated to the island of Taiwan. The CPC lacked the amphibious capacity to invade the island. And in June 1950 the Korean war began bringing renewed US interest in Asia with the US 7 th fleet moving to the Taiwan Strait making any invasion impossible.

The People’s Republic of China was proclaimed on the 1 st October 1949; the KMT however made Taipei their new capital and refused to give in. The result was therefore two regimes both claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. Both sides claim the entire territory of China, not just that which they occupy. Communist countries, along with some non-aligned countries such as India quickly changed their diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Most western countries however continued to recognise Taipei.

This changed in 1971-2 with a sudden thaw in relations between the US and the People’s Republic. First Secretary of State Kissinger and then President Nixon travelled to Beijing [1] showing that the USA would no longer oppose those who have good relations with the PRC helping to precipitate a large number of countries changing their recognition from RoC to PRC. The United States itself did not change recognition until 1 st January 1979 as a result of lobbying by the ‘Taiwan lobby’ and concerns over jeopardising détente with the USSR. [2] Since the US change however Taiwan has been rapidly losing diplomatic support to the People’s Republic.

Only three nations in Africa currently recognise Taiwan: São Tomé and Príncipe, Burkina Faso, and Swaziland. This is out of a total of twenty-two countries that recognise Taiwan all of which are comparatively small states with the biggest being Guatemala (in terms of population)and Paraguay (in terms of area). [3] But with China playing an increasing role in Africa, and the world more generally it is increasingly a question how long the remaining countries will hold out their recognition of Taiwan.

N.B. most of these arguments work for any of the countries that recognise Taiwan, and indeed it might also be used for a debate about The Gambia which has only recently cut ties with Taiwan and has yet to fully recognise the PRC.

For the purposes of this debate I will use PRC, Beijing, and Chinese for the People’s Republic, and RoC, Taipei, and Taiwanese for the Republic of China. When “China” is mentioned it is as either the territory, or the dispute.
