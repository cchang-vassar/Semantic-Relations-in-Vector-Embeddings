Victims are often no better off by seeking prosecutions, especially because prosecutions are often hard to make stick in the first place. But moreover, the process often involves victims having to relive their story while being cross examined, which further harms the victim.

The continued trauma among genocide survivors in Rwanda is largely due to having to give testimonies in such cases [1].
