One of the leading disputes surrounding modern International Criminal Law is how best to deal with the crimes of repressive regimes that have been overthrown. Some advocate for the prosecutions of the offenders. With the establishment of stronger international bodies such as the International Criminal Court and ad hoc tribunals such as the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda such prosecutions have become easier to implement. The International Criminal Court (ICC) began in 2002, formed under the Rome Statute to try the most serious of war crimes when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves. The ICC is an independent international organisation, outside of the United Nations system, and runs on funding from state parties. In order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the ICC needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the United Nations Security Council (being made up by the US, France, Russia, China and the UK), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves. It is therefore now available new regimes to refer their predecessors for prosecution if they have committed crimes against humanity or other war crimes; there has been a suggestion by Geoffrey Robertson that it might be the best place to try those who ordered attacks on protestors in Ukraine during the winter of 2014.[1]

Others however advocate for more reconciliatory approaches, such as amnesties, Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and inquests. An amnesty is an agreement with dictators and leaders who might otherwise be prosecuted that they will not be tried for crimes if they give up power. Truth and Reconciliation commissions (TRC) can also offer amnesties, in exchange for testimony. They serve to provide a forum where both perpetrators and victims give their stories of the conflict, with the aim of providing Restorative Justice, or breaking down ethnic tensions. The most high profile TRC to date occurred in South Africa at the conclusion of the apartheid era. This case will ask whether seeking prosecutions are beneficial with the healing process, and will compare with the alternatives.
