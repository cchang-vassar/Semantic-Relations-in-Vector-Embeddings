The World Bank (2012) have provided data indicating, globally, 75% of the world’s poor are ‘unbanked’ - meaning 75% of the world’s poor do not have access to a bank account. In Sub-Saharan Africa the figure is 76% of adults (CARE, 2014). The focus on banking has taken two key directions. On the one hand, a focus has been placed on understanding the geography of the unbanked - who is unbanked, where, and why. The multiple factors affecting access to banking have been identified. For example, barriers identified by the World Bank include poverty, inaccessibility to banks, and a banking supply issue. On another hand, concern with a lack of banking has focused on the opportunities that being ‘banked’ creates. Whether the concern is on land, empowerment, and entrepreneurialism, banking has been identified as a means for poverty alleviation [1] . Although the evidence remains open to debate.

Microfinance is one model used to enable the unbanked to access financial services [2] - referring to the provision of money, credit, insurance, and savings. Microfinance is structured around the community and providing an alternative system to distribute loans. The social policy model is based on the idea that access to small loans funding will make a difference to the everyday lives of the poor. Small loans should be provided into the community, which is able to organise and distribute loans, and through trust ensure flexible repayment schemes. The model is argued to be responsive to the needs of women.

Microfinance schemes have been rolled out across Africa - integrating informal, traditional finance groups with modern updates. However, this debate looks at the evidence of whether microfinance schemes in Africa are beneficial. How has the geography of money - in terms of savings, spending and future investment - changed through microfinance? What opportunities are emerging for those given access to microfinance? Is the organisation of microfinance working in the African context? Fundamentally, is providing finance to the ‘unbanked’ an effective solution to poverty?
