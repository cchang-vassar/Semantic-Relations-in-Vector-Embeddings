Syria, a relatively small but pivotal Middle Eastern Country, has been on a downward spiral since March 2011 when there were peaceful street protests calling for the President, Bashar al Assad, to step down. Assad responded with force, firing on the protestors in Daara on 21 st March, and within a week demonstrations and some clashes in six of the twelve provincial capitals. Quelling Daara with force was followed in late April with violent clashes in Homs which in turn escalated nationwide on April 22 when more than 100 demonstrators were killed across the country. [1] Some among the protestors responded to force with force and formed the Free Syrian Army at the end of July whose organisation was enhanced by defections from the Syrian army. [2] Peace attempts have failed [3] and the country is now involved in a full scale civil war between rebel groups, that want to overthrow the government as inspired by the other Arab spring revolutions, and Assad's government. The civil war is compounded by the fault lines that run through Syria's history, the government is supported by a Shi'ite sect called the Alawites, that have historically been a persecuted minority but under Bashar's father, Hafez who was president from 1971 to 2000, they rose to prominence. Sunnis, the majority, want to return to political dominance, but these are not the only two groups, there are also Christians and Kurds who both have reason to fear a Sunni return too dominance and worry there will be no place for them in a post-Assad Syria.

The European Union imposed sanctions from 10 th May 2011 with further restrictions in 2012 preventing any export of arms to Syria. [5] Yet both sides have been armed; the Assad by Russia and Syria, [6] and the rebels by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. [7] Western states, unlike in Libya, have so far been unwilling to take any action. However in March 2013, two years after the start of the conflict, David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Francois Hollande, President of France urged the European Union to lift its arms embargo but the rest of Europe was unmoved. The Obama administration has so far also been unwilling to take any steps beyond the diplomatic; the White House has overruled a plan to arm moderate groups of the Free Syrian Army that was backed by much of the Washington foreign policy and security establishment including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Martin Dempsey, and CIA Director David Patraeus. [8] Should Obama have gone along with the establishment’s plan?
