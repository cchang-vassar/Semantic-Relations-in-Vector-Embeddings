Africa has abundant natural resources. From diamond and timber to oil, the continent has a large concentration of mineral wealth which has turned Africa in to a major exporter of these goods. There are 22 countries in Africa which are termed as resource rich, where oils and minerals count for over 20% of GDP. These resources were a primary reason for the involvement of Western powers on the continent, which soon resulted in the Scramble for Africa [1] .

Since decolonisation the West has continued its extraction of Africa’s resources, with other countries such as China involving themselves more recently. Since decolonisation there has been a higher prominence of transnational companies (TNCs) over state actors. These TNCs extract the mineral wealth and export these resources to the rest of the world. Despite the trade of resources from the continent, Africa has arguably not benefitted. This disparity between natural resources and economic development led Jeffery Sachs and Andrew Warner to the claim that there is a resources curse where, despite trade, Africa has seen little development [2] . Resources however are not destiny. There is the possibility to benefit from mineral wealth, through better management of resources and greater transparency, mean that the presence of natural resource is positive.
