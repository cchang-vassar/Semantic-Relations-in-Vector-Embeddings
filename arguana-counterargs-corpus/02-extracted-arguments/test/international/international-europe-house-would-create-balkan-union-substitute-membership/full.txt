# THESIS
This House would create a Balkan Union to substitute membership in the European Union.


# INTRO
The Balkan Peninsula also referred to as Southeastern Europe generally encompasses the countries that are commonly known as the Balkan states: Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Eastern Thrace, the European part of Turkey.

Known for it’s violent history the Balkans have been fighting among each other for a century. The first Balkan War broke out in 1912, followed by the second one the same year. Since then numerous of conflicts have took place among the social states, most recent in 1990 after the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Led by nationalism and religious hatred the conflicts took 300.000 civilian lives thus leaving the independent states with unsolved bilateral issues. Instead of solving the old ones, new problems arrised, when Kosovo became an independent state.

Some efforts are being made by the international community in order to solve the problems but they have left with no successes. After the EU tried to force the states to signing the Balkan stabilization pack only Macedonia and Croatia have decided to sign it.

But besides it’s problems can these state agree to exist together in order to achieve economical and social benefit. And will this union be an answer to the bilateral problems of the Balkan states?
