Federalism is as a system of multilevel government where each level of government has a direct relationship with the citizen. It is distinct both from systems of government where all executive authority rests with a single institution (unitary government) and also from those systems where the decisions at the highest level of government can affect only the state’s interactions with other states and not the functions of lower levels of government or its citizens (confederal government).

Federal systems of government are characterised by two principles - the idea of subsidiarity, which relates to the distribution of powers between the different levels of government, and democracy, which relates to the way in which decisions are taken at any given level.

In the context of federalism, subsidiarity is invoked as the reason for allocating decisions to one level of government rather than another. It is usually defined as insisting that political power should be as decentralised as possible, and only centralised if necessary. Democracy is achieved as each level of government will have its own political relationship with the citizen. Its politicians will hold office because they have won elections specifically for that purpose, rather than because they have been nominated by a different level of government instead. A federal legislature will be composed of directly elected MPs rather than MPs nominated by the parliaments of its member states.

A federal system therefore has to have a constitution to set out the distribution of powers between the different levels of government and to guarantee their practical and political independence in exercising them. The core problem, however, with creating a federal system of governance within Europe is the sovereignity issue – countries will lose their original power and absolute control over their territories and population. Developed countries such as the western European powers do not want to grant such control to only one government, which is going to decide the fate of the entire continent.

Federalism implies a strong degree of subsidiarity, with power devolved to the lowest appropriate level, rather than a very centralised state (such as France or Britain were before reforms in the 1990s). This implies that the current states within the EU, while losing overall independence, would retain considerable powers over issues such as culture, education, law and order, infrastructure, and the taxation and justice systems required to support these, as the states within the U.S.A do today. Devotees of subsidiarity would, however, also wish national governments to devolve other existing powers downwards to their regions and local authorities, further weakening the role of today’s national politicians within a future federal Europe.
