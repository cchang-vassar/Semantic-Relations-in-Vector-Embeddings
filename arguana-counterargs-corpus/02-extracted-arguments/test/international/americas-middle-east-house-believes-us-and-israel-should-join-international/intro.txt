The International Criminal Court came in to being in 2003 as a permanent court created in order to prosecute the most severe international crimes, including crimes against humanity and genocide. It was intended that it would replace the single-purpose international courts such as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

The Rome Statute is what the International Criminal Court derives its powers from. However, as an ordinary international treaty, it does not have universal jurisdiction, it can only prosecute in cases involving nationals of state parties, in cases where the acts took place on the territory of a state party, or when referred by the UN Security Council, which the US has a veto on due to its permanent membership . There are 122 countries that have ratified the Rome Statute including all of the European Union member states, Brazil, Canada and Japan.

The United States has attempted to “un-sign” the Rome Statute by declaring it has no intention to ratify the Rome Statute – something that would require a vote of the US Senate, which has been highly hostile to ratification. Subsequent US legislation, including the American Service-Members’ Protection Act, dubbed the “Hague Invasion Act” by its critics, authorizes the US president to use “all means necessary and appropriate” to remove any Americans from the ICC – in theory, according to critics of the legislation, even up to invading The Hague. Israel never signed it in the first place. Both countries fear that the ICC could be used as a political weapon against them.

Similarly, Israel initially signed the Rome Statute but subsequently "unsigned". Israel’s concerns are centred on long-running issues with the Palestinians, and the US concerns are based on the prospect of a future US military intervention that they consider justified being subject to prosecution, coupled with doubts over the compatibility of the US constitution, both in terms of national sovereignty and the protections available for defendants such as trial by jury, and rules of evidence.

Would it be in the best interests of the global community if the USA and Israel were to join the International Criminal Court?
