This debate centres around two crucial changes occurring across Africa: technology and a youthful population. The demographic transition, occurring internationally, showcases the rise of a ‘youth bulge’ [1] . Across the developing world statistics show youths will account for &lt;25% of the population by 2020 [2] ; and in Africa the figures are higher. In Africa today, 70% of the population is under 30 and by 2020 youths (15-29) are projected to account for ~28% of the population [3] . In response to the identified demographic changes questions are being raised concerning why such trends are emerging; what youths are doing; why youths matter, and to what extent the rising young population present a resource for developing countries. In focusing on youths in Africa, two extreme discourses have emerged. First, youths are being identified as entrepreneurs - they hold the resources, skills, and drive, to start up new businesses and markets. As the World Development Report (2007) states, the increasing proportion of youths represents an untapped resource for Africa. Secondly and alternatively, discussion on youths has also centered on their ‘dangerousness’. Youths have been defined, and branded, as criminals, violent actors, and leaders of conflict [4] . In this perspective, current projections of a ‘youth bulge’ in Africa are a cause of concern and risk needing to be monitored, not opportunity.

Additionally, a technological shift across Africa has received attention. Africa has gone digital, and is using technology to contribute to national GDPs and create a new position within the global-economy [5] . Over half of urban consumers have access to 'internet-capable devices'. The emergence of technology, and mobile devices, across the continent is presenting new opportunities for productivity, social policy, and individual livelihoods. However, to what extent is Africa's 'technological revolution' a reality for all; is it the right technology; and can it change the perception of Africa? More importantly what is it being used for?

In focusing on the role of technology this debate shifts focus to understand what changes will arise for young people across Africa. An entrepreneur reflects someone with innovative ideas and an ability to manage them in order to enhance the efficiency of a firm. Can technology provide a solution to create new jobs and more entrepreneurs? Can it integrate, and include, youths in society? Can the technology actually be used by youths to explore their talents, ambitions, and desires?

[1] Typically ‘youth’ reflects a stage of transition between childhood and adulthood; defined as being aged between 15 and 29, however, it is important to note variations emerge in the definition of youths across Africa. For example in Tanzania a youthful population is defined as being under 25 years, while the African Youth Charter define ‘youths’ between ages of 15 and 35.
