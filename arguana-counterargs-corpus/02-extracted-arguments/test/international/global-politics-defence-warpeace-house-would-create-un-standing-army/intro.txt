A standing army is a permanent military force, entirely under the command of a single authority. This is almost always a national government, although in the past European colonial companies sometimes maintained their own private military forces, as did feudal barons and warlords (for example, in China in the 1920s). At present the UN has no military force of its own to send on peacekeeping or peace enforcement missions. Instead, it has to gather together troops and equipment volunteered by member states on an ad hoc basis for each individual crisis.

Moreover, the army would only act at the behest of the Security Council. It would only act in peacekeeping capacities , in order to stay overtly aligned to the neutrality and civilian focus of the United Nations as a whole.

A UN standing army would be under the control of the UNSC; if individual states could pull troops out of it when they chose to (for example because they disagreed with the objective of a particular mission), then it would not fulfil the true definition of a standing army. There are significant practical Issues to be considered: how large the force would be? What military capabilities it would have (e.g. would it have air and sea power?)? How it would be recruited? How it would be funded and where it might be based.? To what extent it would add to or replace the existing methods of raising troops should also be considered? Long term peacekeeping missions (for example, in Cyprus or Bosnia) might still be undertaken by detachments volunteered by individual states, while the UN Standing Army might be deployed to deal with short-term crises.
