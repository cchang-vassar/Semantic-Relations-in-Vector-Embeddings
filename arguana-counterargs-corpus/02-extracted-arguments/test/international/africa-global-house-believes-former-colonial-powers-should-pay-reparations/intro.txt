Under colonialism, developed and established countries exerted power over less-developed or newly discovered countries. It was ‘a practice of domination’, and ‘the subjugation of one people to another’ [1] , where a dependant territory was politically and economically controlled [2] by the colonial power. Many believe that such territories were unashamedly exploited by the colonial powers, both in terms of economic opportunity and the human rights of the native people. Colonial powers often attempted to disguise motives by labelling their control of colonies as a ‘civilising mission’ [3] , to reconcile the cultural and religious beliefs of the native people with Western cultural values of ‘civilisation, commerce, and Christianity’ [4] , in the words of explorer and missionary David Livingstone. However, colonial belief in their own ‘national, racial, and cultural superiority’ [5] meant that the cultures and values of the colonies were often damaged and abused, and colonial powers had little hesitation in exploiting the economic opportunities of the colonies to their own advantage without giving thought to how the colonies themselves would be affected.

Many groups advocate that developed countries should pay reparations to their former colonies, which tend to be less developed. These reparations fall into both an economic and a moral context. In terms of economy, some former colonies claim that colonisation, or even the sudden end of colonisation in the case of Japan and Korea [6] has damaged their ability to form a stable and flourishing economy disruption of trade [7] , or by seriously damaging and abusing the natural resources available within the former colonies [8] . Kwame Nkrumah, the ‘first head of an independent Ghana’ [9] , labelled colonialism as ‘the policy by which the . . . colonial power, binds her colonies to herself by political ties with the primary object of promoting her own economic advantages.’ [10] In this way, it is perceived that the economic interest of the former colony had been ignored unless it also coincided with the interest of the colonial power.

In a moral context, some groups argue that former colonial powers should pay reparations for wrongdoings during the time of colonisation. One crucial example of this is the demand that Western colonial powers should pay African former colonies up to $777,000billion in reparations for slavery [11] . This is more an argument to repair the historical moral wrongdoing of the colonial power. However in both economic and moral cases reparations present a potential to facilitate development in under-developed countries and the developing world more broadly. Particularly in countries such as African nations which suffer from high rates of poverty [12] and high international debt [13] , financial reparations could pose a solution to serious domestic problems.
