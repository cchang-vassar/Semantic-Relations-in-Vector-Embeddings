With the Lisbon Treaty reforms, the EU has sought, amongst other things, to strengthen and to streamline its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and to develop further its Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP). As part of this, the post of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) has been joined with that of First Vice President of the Commission (VP) responsible for External Relations (including development and relations between the EU and neighbouring states to the East and South). The holder of this post (HRVP), currently Baroness Catherine Ashton, acts on the basis of agreement within the Commission and unanimous agreement between all the EU foreign ministers. Her stated goal is to steer the EU foreign policy agenda and represent the EU as a united front. With this post – as well as that of the European Council President – the EU will have partially answered the question: if we want to talk to Europe, who do we call? The creation of the post of HRVP is a culmination of a number of different efforts to turn the initial project for a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) – adopted under the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 – into a workable, better integrated policy that is able to respond to international crises more quickly and to present a united front to the world on behalf of the EU. It is a direct response to both internal and external criticisms that the EU has had to face over the last 15 years in its handling of a variety of international crises; the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the ‘war on terror’ and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. With bigger budgetary and diplomatic powers - including the creation of a dedicated EU diplomatic service (the European External Action Service) - the newly strengthened post of HRVP may set the stage for the creation of an increasingly stronger political union along practical rather than rhetorical lines.
