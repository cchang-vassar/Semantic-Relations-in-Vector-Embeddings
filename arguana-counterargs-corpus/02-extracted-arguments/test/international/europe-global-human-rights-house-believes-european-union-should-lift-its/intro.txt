Both the USA and the European Union have bans on arms sales to China. These were put in place in 1989, as part of the international reaction to the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. In the sixteen years since the ban was imposed, China has experienced rapid growth and has become a very important part of the global economy, both importing and exporting goods worth many billions of dollars a year. It has also opened up to foreign investment and, as a recent member of the World Trade Organisation, is committed to further opening. Over the same period, China has also become more active diplomatically, participating more in global and regional bodies such as the United Nations. The Chinese leadership has called this increasing engagement China's "peaceful rise", although other nations worry about continuing territorial claims affecting relations with most of China's neighbours, as well as pressures from growing popular nationalism. The United States in particular is concerned about China's claim on Taiwan, which is regarded as a break-away province by the mainland, but which enjoys an unspoken promise of American support in case of an unprovoked Chinese invasion. In recent years China has spent a great deal on modernising its armed forces, buying advanced military equipment from Russia in particular, and much of this build-up appears to be designed to enable China to project its power outside its own borders.

As China has become more important on the world stage, and a very important trading partner for Europe, it has lobbied hard for the EU arms ban to be lifted (Australia's similar ban was lifted in 1992, but there is no prospect of the United States doing so). France in particular has argued within the EU for removing the ban, pointing out that a 1998 code of conduct on weapons sales would ensure that European military technology did not flood into China. This position appeared to have widespread support from member states, including Germany, Italy and (at times) the U.K, although the European Parliament and public opinion in most member states remained strongly against change. It looked likely the ban would be repealed in mid-2005 but plans were put aside after strong American pressure and concern about China's attitude to Taiwan. Nonetheless, the issue appears likely to return and will remain controversial.
