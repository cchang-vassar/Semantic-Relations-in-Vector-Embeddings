The case: (Not) reporting homosexuality in the Middle East

Homosexuality is a taboo subject mainstream Arabic news outlets regularly avoid. If reported at all, stories typically address homosexuality as a foreign phenomenon or loathsome disease unique to the west. Journalist Brian Whitaker explores how Middle Eastern media self-censor homosexuality in his 2006 book Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East. According to Whitaker, regional governments routinely censor positive portrayals of homosexuality. When the topic is discussed in mainstream media, the Arabic word shadh, loaded with negative connotations equivalent to pervert in English, is most often used to mean gay. Journalists improperly trained on homosexuality are also to blame for the dearth of accurate coverage, allowing grossly inaccurate stereotypes of this minority group to pass as fact. Outside of the newsroom, fear of legal and cultural backlash has also stymied homosexuality as a topic of literary exploration. Proving its point, Unspeakable Love is banned in many Middle Eastern countries.

Brian Pellot’s opinion

As a gay man I’m biased. As a journalist I’m not. If an event is timely, happens locally, involves conflict and has significant impact, it’s a story. Events that fit this classic definition of news happen every day in the Middle East and are reported as routine. When stories involve critical elements considered culturally taboo like homosexuality, they are often ignored by state and independent media in an attempt to preserve cultural sensitivities. News is news, and facts should be reported without biases. Al-Jazeera English’s relatively balanced reports on regional gay issues do not give its Arabic counterpart carte blanche to avoid or vilify the subject. News is seldom pleasant. Just because some audiences in the Middle East might be offended by homosexuality does not mean significant stories should be wiped from the evening news.
