Turkey, being as one of the founding members of the Council of Europe and one of the earliest member states of NATO is pursuing its wish to access the European Union in a near future. Turkey has been an associate member of first the European Economic Community and its successors since the Ankara Agreement of 1963. [1] This associated status was intended to be an interim measure in a process leading to full accession, which has not yet happened. Turkey’s first application to join the European Union as a full member was in 1987 however it was not officially recognized as a candidate country for the admission in the EU until 1999 and negotiations did not begin until 2005. In 2008 a revised accession partnership was adopted. [2] Now that Turkey has started on the process of applying it needs to complete negotiations on the thirty-five chapters of EU law, the acquis communautaire, however so far only thirteen chapters have even been opened and only one, science and research, has been closed. [3]

The biggest sticking point in Turkey’s negotiations with the European Union is relations with Cyprus, which is now a member of the EU. Cyprus is blocking any further progress by Turkey towards membership as a result of Turkey’s support for Northern Cyprus. Cyprus was divided in 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the Turkish speaking northern half of the island in response to a coup by supporters of a union with Greece. [4] The internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus as a member state since 2004 now has a veto over Turkey’s application to join the EU. [5]

As a result of the drawn out application process that Turkey has been through Turkey has seen many countries which applied to join after it overtake and join the EU even before Turkey has got any approximate date of admission. Turkey has already been waiting for twenty five years while Austria, which applied in 1989 became a member in only six years. [6] Even neighboring countries that are similarly poor such as Bulgaria have joined in less than half the time that Turkey has spent as an applicant. However as Turkey’s European Affairs Minister Egemen Bagis notes "Until now, all countries that have started negotiations with the EU have become full members. Turkey will not be the first exception." [7]
