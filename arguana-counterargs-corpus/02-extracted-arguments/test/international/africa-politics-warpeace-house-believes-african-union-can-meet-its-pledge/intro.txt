Africa has been plagued by conflict in the second half of the 20 th century and the start of the 21 st. 65% of states in Sub-Saharan Africa have experienced an armed conflict since independence with the number of conflicts rising from only one in 1964 to a height of eighteen in 1992 before falling back to single figures. This may be exaggerated as the data set counts conflicts as where there were 25 battle deaths in a year – a very low threshold. [1] But while some of these conflicts may have been very small, Africa has also had its share of the most horrific conflicts since the Second World War, most notably the Congolese civil war which up to 2006 had caused an estimated 3.5million deaths, [2] and the Rwandan Genocide (not always considered a conflict) that may well have killed up to 800,000 people. [3]

Despite (or perhaps because of) this history, the 50 th Anniversary Solemn Declaration by the African Union (AU) in 2013 declared “We pledge not to bequeath the burden of conflicts to the next generation of Africans and undertake to end all wars in Africa by 2020”. [4] Ending all wars is a high minded principle and a desire to do so is regularly espoused by politicians but is it actually achievable in Africa – and by the ambitious date of 2020?
