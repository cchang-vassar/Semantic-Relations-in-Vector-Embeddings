Traditionally, there has been a view that Africa is a violent, dictator led, undeveloped continent. Extremes of poverty and weather, combined with exploitation, corruption and war are common themes when one thinks of Africa. Conventionally seen as the least developed continent in the world, Africa contains 34 of the 49 LDCs (least developed countries) [1] .

In recent years, however, a new narrative has gained popularity; one of ‘Africa rising’. As early as 2001, Time Magazine made the claim that a new narrative was emerging [2] of an Africa beginning to break the status quo. This idea of Africa ‘rising’ is a reference to the current strong economic growth and aiding factors such as democracy, development, and political stability. National GDP, poverty, democracy indicators and education have all seen improvements in the majority of African countries, and Africa is now being hailed as ‘the world’s next economic powerhouse’ [3] . In the past few years this has become a dominant discourse when one discusses Africa’s future. There has, however, been a similar discourse in the past. The 1960s during the wave of independence that swept the continent saw a similar euphoria about the future emerge, although the economic growth never materialised.

The proposal is that this dominant discourse is correct in its assumptions that Africa is emerging from its dark age. [4]
