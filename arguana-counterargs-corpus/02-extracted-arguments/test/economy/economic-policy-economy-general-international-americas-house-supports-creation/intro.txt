In 2001, during the Summit of the Americas held in Qu√©bec City, then President George W. Bush spearheaded the effort to introduce a trade agreement that would have united all 34 countries of the Americas (except Cuba) into a single free trade area, stretching from Alaska to Patagonia. Proponents of the agreement presented it as an extension to NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) which already covers the US, Canada, and Mexico. Negotiations between the parties were supposed to conclude and be implemented before 2006. However, the plan never came to fruition, beset from all sides by protests from various interest groups, all with their distinct reasons for opposing the agreement. Human rights activists, environmentalists, farmers, labour groups, anti-globalisation protesters all opposed the plan. Venezuela president, Hugo Chavez, was also a vocal critic who managed to coalesce other socialist South American leaders around him. However, former Brazilian president, Ignacio Lula da Silva and Argentinean president Cristina Fernandez de Krincher were in favour of the plan but disagreed on the specifics. Current Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff is also a supporter. Therefore, the proposal for the FTAA is sure to come up again for debate at the Sixth Summit of the Americas that will take place in Colombia, in 2012.
