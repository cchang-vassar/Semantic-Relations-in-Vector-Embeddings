Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was founded in late 1950s as a mechanism against further food shortages in Europe. European leaders envisioned the CAP as a system of subsidies for damaged agricultural industry still affected by residues of WWII with several main goals stated in the Treaty of Rome, Article 39 :

1. to increase productivity, by promoting technical progress and ensuring the optimum use of the factors of production, in particular labour;

2. to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural Community;

3. to stabilise markets;

4. to secure availability of supplies;

5. to provide consumers with food at reasonable prices.

The ways how to reach these goals varied – several policies ranging from interventions of EU when the price of goods is under certain level to production quotas to avoid overproduction and direct subsidies paid to farmers. However, these policies are only one part of CAP as whole. The second pillar of CAP is the rural development programs aimed at improvement of competitiveness of agricultural and forestry sector, improving the environment and the countryside, diversification of rural economy and implementation of local development strategies through public-private partnerships..

Nonetheless, CAP faced a lot of criticism during the years. One of the main scandals were so-called mountains of butter and lakes of wine and milk which were in the 80s a result of EU purchasing the goods in order to maintain the reasonable market prices. However, in recent years there were signs that the butter mountains can be back. [1] Among other criticised aspects were the effects of CAP on environment, unfairness to new member states of EU, hurting of smaller farms among others. The critique escalated to such degree that in 2007 Sweden became first EU country to take position that all EU subsidies should be abolished.
