Tunisia is well known for its numerous tourist attractions and its holiday destinations on its coastline. In 2010, the tourism industry brought in a revenue of £1.18 billion (3.2 billion dinar) 1. The industry employed 450,000 people directly and 2 million indirectly 2. The beach holiday resorts are popular with Europeans due to the high temperatures, high quality of hotels and, unlike many other Muslim countries, the availability of alcohol. The remains of the ancient city of Carthage, excavated in the mid nineteenth century, have attracted those interested in history and classical studies. The Saharan desert has also proved to be a popular tourist destination; the set of the fictional planet of Tatooine from the Star Wars films is a famous attraction.

The leisure industry suffered in 2011 when the Jasmine revolution swept President for life Ben Ali from power. Tourism decreased from £1.18 billion to £814 million (2.2 billion dinar) in 2011 due to the perceived instability in the new transitional environment 2. While there has been an increase in revenue since the revolution, the event has prompted a discussion on whether Tunisia should rely on their tourism anymore. Post revolution Tunisia has been focussed on using this sector for economic recovery. Tunisian minister Jamal Gamra has been quoted as saying that ‘the importance of tourism-and investment in tourism- to the economy cannot be understated’ 3. This debate is focussed on whether relying upon tourism for future economic growth is viable or not.
