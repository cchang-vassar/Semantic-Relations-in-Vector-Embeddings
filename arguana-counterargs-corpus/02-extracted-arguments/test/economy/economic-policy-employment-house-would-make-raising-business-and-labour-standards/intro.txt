Developmental aid exists in a variety of forms such as the Official Developmental Assistance (ODA) awarded by donor nations in the UN’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC). These flows of official financing are given with the aim of “promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as the main objective…”. [1] Although there may be discussion over what parameters or index should be used to measure the overall development of a nation, the success of the awarded aid depends largely on the localised effects of the particular aid projects and any wider results that have been obtained. ODA often has strings attached to the aid, but this usually is conditions such as equipment having to be bought from the country that is providing the aid. There may sometimes be other conditions such as a country being unwilling to give development assistance to countries that have particularly poor human rights records, though this will almost certainly not apply to any emergency aid. For example the UK suspended aid to Rwanda at the end of 2012 in response to reports showing Rwanda was fueling the civil war in neighbouring Congo. [2]

This however does not usually translate into action in other similar areas. In the contexts of scarce accountability and poor labour standards, development aid often carries on regardless. This is despite International labour standards, being particularly suited to ensure that economic development remains concentrated on improving human life and dignity by making sure that economic growth and development go along with the creation of decent work [3] . In other words labour standards could be seen as a core part of any sustainable development that such aid is aiming to achieve. Should raising labour standards therefore, to increase the efficacy of aid, be considered a pre-requisite for development aid. Whether this is a fair, efficient and more importantly, achievable criterion to be met by developing nations is the keystone focus of this debate.
