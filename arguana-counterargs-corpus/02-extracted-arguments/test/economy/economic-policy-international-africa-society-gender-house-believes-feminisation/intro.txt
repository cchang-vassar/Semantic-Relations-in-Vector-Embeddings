In the 1990s the World Band and the IMF demanded that developing countries follow structural adjustment programmes to make their economies more market orientated. The resulting change to free market policy brought about changes in the labour market - changes in terms of who is involved in the labour force, what type of employment individuals are able to access, and the degree of risk associated with jobs. Loans were made conditional on the implementation of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) encouraging neoliberalism, flexibilisation, and a decentralisation in control over the economy. Conditions applied affected the lives of inhabitants both in urban and rural economies. Today Africa’s labour force is continuing to change following the economic crisis.

A feminisation of labour has been occurred in both periodic events. A ‘feminising’ labour force can be referred to in two aspects: firstly, an increase in the number of women being incorporated into paid work. Secondly, ‘feminisation’ refers to the increasing flexibilisation of work for both men and women. A shift in the nature of employment is found, with a rise in informal employment and irregular conditions of work. The feminisation of the labour force therefore means changes in the structure of who is employed and the structure of jobs available.

This debate focuses on labour force participation and empowerment [1] . The World Development Report (2013) argued jobs are key to development - more jobs are needed and focus should be on getting employment. However, by exploring the picture of female employment and jobs, does work provide empowerment - who is empowered; what kind of empowerment; and fundamentally, how long for? Will the convergence, and continued inclusion of women, in employment mean gender differences will disappear in Africa’s labour market and society? Finally, with women seen to be able to pioneer national development and GDP growth (i.e. Barsh and Lee, 2011) should we be encouraging more women to enter the labour force?

[1] Women’s empowerment is defined broadly as the processes of agency which enable women to achieve change in their lives and against the larger structures constraining, and subordinating them (Kabeer, 1999)
