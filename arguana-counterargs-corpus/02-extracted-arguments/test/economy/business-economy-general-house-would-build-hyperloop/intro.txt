California is building a high speed railway line to link its two most populous areas; San Francisco and Los Angeles. The project is staggeringly expensive and has been criticised as too slow by Elon Musk, the creator of Paypal, Tesla, and SpaceX. Instead he suggests a new idea he calls the Hyperloop to be used between “high traffic city pairs that are less than about 1500 km or 900 miles apart”. Beyond 900 miles Musk believes that supersonic jets would be more economic – though of course at the moment there is no supersonic air travel. The route for which the proposal is initially designed from San Francisco to Los Angeles is only 350 miles so the Hyperloop would be the best possible mode of transport; it would be several times faster than any current commercial transportation method as well as being cheaper.

There are several main elements to the proposal;

First it is in a tube the whole distance. The reason for this is to reduce resistance. The tube would be at a much lower pressure than the outside world so there would be less density of air creating less resistance and so allowing faster speeds while using less energy. The tube itself would be on pylons and could be built above existing road infrastructure for much of the way, with the exception of when the corners on the roads are too tight.

Despite the low pressure there would still be a build up of air in front of the pod (the individual car in which the users are seated) essentially making it like a syringe with the pod pushing the air in front so once again building up resistance. The Hyperloop however would use a compressor fan to transfer air at high pressure to the bottom and rear of the pod. This would allow the creation of an aircushion – Musk suggests this is much the same as an air hockey table – underneath the pod so eliminating the need for wheels.

The Hyperloop would be powered by electricity. The pod would be initially accelerated by external round induction motors, as used by Musk’s own Tesla cars, at the stations that would bring the pods to high speeds of around 700 mph. The limited resistance would mean there would be no motor operating most of the time but the pods would be given a reboost every 70 miles or so. The pods themselves would have batteries to power their fan and any internal electronics. As it is all electric Musk suggests that by placing solar panels along the top of the tube the Hyperloop would generate more than enough electricity to run itself so this would be a green method of travel.

The proposal for the Hyperloop provides two separate options for the system; either a passengers only system in which each pod would take 28 passengers, or one in which the pod would also accommodate 3 vehicles which increases the cost of the system. [1]

The Hyperloop would not be anything like any current transportation, Musk seems to have described the proposal quite accurately in the months before the announcement as a “cross between a Concorde and a railgun and an air hockey table”. [2] It would be like concord in that it is an (almost) supersonic transportation system, a railgun in terms of how the propulsion is created and an air hockey table keeping the pods afloat.
