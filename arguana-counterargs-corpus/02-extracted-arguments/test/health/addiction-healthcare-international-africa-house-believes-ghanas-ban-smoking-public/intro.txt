Smoking tobacco, in all its forms, is a highly popular recreational drug. However, it is known that it is very harmful, and has been described by the World Health Organization as the single biggest cause of preventable death worldwide 1 . Due to the prevalence of its use, banning it entirely would be highly unpopular and politically something that would not be considered – Bhutan is the only country where it is illegal, it has been banned in the country since 2005 2 .

The ill effects of tobacco should not be considered to simply be a “first world problem”, as tobacco smoking is not just a “first world phenomenon” – an estimated 82% of the world’s smokers live in lower and middle income countries 3 . Indeed, as tobacco use falls off in the developed world 4 , the international tobacco industry is looking at new markets. In parts of Nigeria, 25% of teenagers smoke 5 .

Many nations have brought in laws and policies aimed at banning or heavily restricting smoking in public places – a solution endorsed by the World Health Organization 6 . These bans often take the forms of bans on smoking in enclosed – i.e. indoor public places, or parts of them. This would cover workplaces, bars, restaurants and amongst other places. Reasons for these bans are legion – chief amongst them “passive smoking”, the risk of tobacco smoke on those who are not smoking themselves.

In 2012, Ghana banned smoking in public places 7 . Tobacco advertising had already been banned in the country in 1982. 8 These measures while unusual in Africa are common in the Global North, where there has been resulting falls in tobacco use.
