While all continents suffer from their own prominent diseases, Africa bears a disproportionate burden. The continents holds 11% of the population, but has 25% of the world’s disease burden [1] . While HIV and malaria are well known, other common deadly diseases such as measles and pneumonia are also prominent on the continent; all of which are exacerbated by high levels of malnutrition. HIV/AIDS alone cost the lives of around 1.2 million Africans in 2012, 75% of the global deaths to the disease [2] . Cheap, generic drugs have been proposed as an answer to this problem

Medical drugs take one of two forms. The first is a patented drug, which has been researched and developed (R&amp;D) by a company and cannot legally be reproduced by another company for a set period of time. This allows the initial company to recuperate financial losses for R&amp;D. Once the patent ends the information on how to create the drug becomes available to all drug companies. They are generally produced at a lower price due to competition between firms and are called generic drugs. Some countries, such India and Brazil, have developed a generic drug industry, with Africa as a primary market [3] . Some legislation in developed countries already provides high quality generic drugs to Africa and there are propositions to increase the quantities. There is, however, a conflict of interests between pharmaceutical companies operating for a profit and humanitarians. This debate examines whether the mass export of high quality generic drugs to Africa is a viable and effective option.
