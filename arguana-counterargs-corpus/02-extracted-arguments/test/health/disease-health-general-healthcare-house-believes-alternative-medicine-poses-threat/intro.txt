Alternative (or complementary) medicine, as a concept, covers such a huge range of techniques and practices. However, broadly speaking, the term usually refers those techniques that fall outside conventional, pharmacological or surgical practices. In some countries such as the US and Germany practitioners are frequently physicians; in others they may have no medical training at all. Generally speaking both critics and supporters tend to define alternative medicine as any medical approach “that does not fall within the realm of conventional medicine” [i] .

From the point of view this debate, the status of alternative medicine raises a number of problems, as is always the case with defining terms in the negative. It may be relatively easy to criticize the medical value of “crystal healing”, “psychic surgery” or a laying of hands, but aromatherapy, massage, chiropractic treatments and, notably, homeopathy are slightly harder to attack. However, there is a vibrant debate in all of these areas. In the same way that there are certain areas that Prop needs to leave off limits for the debate to work at all the same applies, for Op, to some ‘holistic’ treatments that realistically could be prescribed by a mainstream practitioner such as good diet and regular exercise or removing smoking and drinking – whether these are called pathogens or negative forces is, frankly, incidental. As a result this debate will focus on those areas that are contentious. Critically, it needs to focus on the extent to which some of the treatments currently on offer are simply an expensive scam. Another common criticism is that practitioners who promote their approach as, genuinely, an alternative, rather than a compliment to contemporary medicine can be taking risks with their patients’ health, hopes and even lives.

According to a survey in South Australia about half of the adult population of the developed world use alternative medicine, [ii] and in the developing world it could be considerably more. Either way it is clear that for a sizable portion of the world, complementary and alternative medicines represent a significant part of their medical treatment. It’s also worth noting that a large number of conventional remedies were once considered “alternative”. Indeed, the consumption of prepared herbs and plants said to have beneficial or medicinal properties, for example, predates written history and underpins sizable chunks of modern pharmacology. A significant auxiliary industry has now grown up around the process of identifying the active chemicals contained in flora and refining and concentrating their properties for use in clinical medicine.

Despite the sheer scale and duration of longitudinal studies conducted by the National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the US (NCCAM) not a single study has provided firm proof for the effects that many popular alternative therapies are claimed to have. Arguably, of course, the moment science backs something up, it ceases to be alternative. Perhaps in the light of this Arnold Relman, former Editor in Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine commented, “There really is no such thing as alternative medicine – only medicine that has been proved to work and medicine that hasn’t”.

On a word of caution it’s easy for this debate to degenerate into either anecdotal evidence or a squabble about the psychosomatic benefits of one therapy or another. Generally both are best avoided, after all if Op proves the benefits of a placebo it’s not exactly something that is new to science which has been using them since its foundation and the fact that Aunt Bertha’s hip is much better now that she’s using reflexology is not really a point that lends itself to open debate.
