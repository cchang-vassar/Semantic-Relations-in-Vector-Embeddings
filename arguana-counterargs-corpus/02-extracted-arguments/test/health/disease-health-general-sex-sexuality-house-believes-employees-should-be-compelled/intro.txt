Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in people, a condition in which the patient’s immune system is progressively compromised until it is unable to combat opportunistic infections and cancers. HIV progresses to AIDS at a very variable rate that depends upon the health of the patient but on average takes around 10 years. A person with AIDS will only survive for about a year without treatment, but in a Western state with access to the latest treatments life expectancy can be raised to several decades. Like all viruses HIV is incurable and it has proven difficult to develop a vaccine. The main routes of HIV infection are through blood transfusions (largely eliminated in the developed world by screening), unsafe sex, contaminated needles and mother-to-daughter transmission either in the womb or though breast milk.

HIV is therefore a disease which is very difficult to transmit, yet at the same time extremely lethal. It’s been estimated that AIDS killed 25 million people between 1981 and 2005, making it one of the most destructive pandemics in recorded history. Even in the developed world, HIV infection is a life changing event that will require the patient to carefully adjust many aspects of their life. They will have to participate in a rigorous anti-viral treatment regime that requires taking drugs several times a day.

An employer may (depending on the circumstances) have serious concerns about the HIV status of his employees given the possible risks to themselves, to other employees, and to their future within the business.
