Organ donations are one of the most vital steps of progress made in the field of medicine. Where the failure of a vital organ previously would lead to a person’s imminent death, there is a chance today of saving lives by transplanting hearts, kidneys, livers etc. However, in the case of organs such as hearts and livers, transplantation can only take place if a patient’s need coincides with the death of a donor. In the status quo, many people die as there is not a sufficient amount of organs that match the blood type and antibodies of the recipients. [1] If these are not matched then there is a chance of rejection of the organ. Live donations are growing becoming more common and often increase survival rates but this is only for cases where an organ can be donated with little risk of life such as with a kidney. [2] This proposal is much more extreme as it would allow parents instead of standing by watching their children die, unable to do anything to save them to take action. The proposed motion would allow the relatives whose organs would save their loved one to donate their organ at the expense of their own life. While this is an attractive idea to some, for others it violates the fundamental principles of how we are to relate to life. It also touches upon the question of whether one can qualify and quantify human life. Regardless of which side might be found to be right, it is a motion that affects families at a pivotal point of their lives, but also health care professionals, religions, politicians and society as a whole [3] .
