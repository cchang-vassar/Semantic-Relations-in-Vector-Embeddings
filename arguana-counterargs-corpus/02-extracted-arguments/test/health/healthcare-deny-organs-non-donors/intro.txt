There exists no nation on Earth that does not face a severe shortage of organs available for transplant. As a result, millions die every year for want of a heart, lung, or other vital organ. There are several mechanisms by which people receive donated organs. Many people receive them from loved ones, provided that the two people in question are an acceptable match on the basis of their HLA serotype {The Effect of}. If they are not a match, some people choose to engage in “organ swaps”, where a loved one of one person needing an organ agrees to donate an organ to a stranger in exchange for the stranger’s loved one doing likewise (such trades need not even involve the same organ, and can even involve complex chains of people involved.) {5 Receive Kidneys} In most developed countries, the sale of organs is illegal. Finally, and most pertinently, many individuals in need of organs sign up for waitlists in which they are to receive organs that have been donated by registered organ donors to a public repository of organs. The resolution is that those who are not registered organ donors should be denied organ transplants from such a public system. Obviously this wouldn’t mean letting an organ go to waste rather than give it to a non-donor; instead it would mean giving absolute priority to donors.
