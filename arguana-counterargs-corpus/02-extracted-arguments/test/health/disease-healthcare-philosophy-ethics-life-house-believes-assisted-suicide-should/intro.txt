Assisted suicide is “Suicide accomplished with the aid of another person, especially a physician.” [1] It is sometimes used interchangeably with euthanasia “The act or practice of ending the life of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or an incurable condition, as by lethal injection or the suspension of extraordinary medical treatment.” [2] The important part is that it is assisted death rather than simply being allowed to die. Assisted suicide is an issue which causes world-wide conflict with various countries differing strongly on their legal stances towards assisted suicide. Currently there are only four places which openly and legally authorise assisted suicide; Oregon since 1997, Switzerland since 1941, Belgium since 2002 and the Netherlands since 2002. Equally, there are countries such as Russia, Hungary, Republic of Ireland and England and Wales that look upon assisted suicide as a criminal offence with harsh penalties. Between these two extremes there are also countries such as Germany, Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg where there is no specific law against assisted suicide but equally there is no legislation proclaiming it to be legal. [3] . Doctors themselves are divided upon whether it should be legalised. In September 1996 issue of the BMA News Review, the results of a survey of over 750 GPs and hospital doctors showed that 46% of doctors supported a change in the law to allow them to carry out the request of a terminally ill patient for voluntary euthanasia, 44% were against euthanasia and supported the present law and 37% said they would be willing to actively help end the life of a terminally ill patient who had asked for euthanasia and so assisting suicide, if the law allowed it. [4] This debate will examine both the propositional and oppositional arguments concerning whether assisted suicide should be legalised. This debate has received a lot of press recently due to the death of Jack Kevorkian, the man nicknamed 'Dr Death' since he claimed to have assisted more than 100 suicides. Throughout his life he waged a defiant campaign to help people end their lives, both sides of the debate would agree that he provoked a national discussion, and doctor-assisted suicide is now legal in three American states.
