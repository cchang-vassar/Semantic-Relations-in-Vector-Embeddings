Even following the collapse of white minority rule, South Africa is still a country with many racial divides in society. Sport is no exception.

Rugby union [1] was, and still is, a sport associated with white groups, particularly Afrikaans speakers, in South Africa. Before fully democratic rule in 1994, the national team, the Springboks [2] , were considered poster boys for apartheid. They were met with opposition after the 1977 Gleneagles Agreement between Commonwealth nations, which signalled the strong support for a sporting boycott of South Africa. South Africa did not compete in a Rugby World Cup until the 1995 tournament, held in South Africa shortly after the end of apartheid. The home team famously won, but the abiding image of the final was Nelson Mandela, political prisoner turned President, presenting the William Webb Ellis trophy to captain Francois Pienaar.

Despite the increase in non-white participation (the national team only contained one non-white player in 1995, Chester Arthur, but there were nine non-white players in the national first team for two major matches in 2013 [3] ), even after the end of apartheid, rugby union is a sport largely comprised of the white minority, in particular Afrikaans speakers. While South Africa is one of the most competitive nations in international rugby, the sport is not the most popular in the country (that is football). Rugby union has been seen as, to some extent, a sport for social “elites” in many, but not all of the countries it has been played.

Effective for the 2014 season, the South African Rugby Union has created a system of racial quotas in the third tier Vodacom Cup competition (below the Super Rugby competition run with Australia and New Zealand, and the Currie Cup, the flagship domestic competition [4] ). Each side, which represents all or part of a South African province (except for a Kenyan team), will have to have a minimum number of black players: seven in each match-day 22 player squad, two of which forwards, five of which in the starting fifteen [5] . No penalties for violation of these quotas have been outlined by SARU.

No such quota system is used for the national team, or the Currie Cup and Super Rugby. A quota system was introduced in 1999, but dropped in 2004 [6] . In South Africa, Cricket (another sport historically far more popular in white communities) has used quotas too, with the domestic professional franchises required to field one black player with cash bonuses available for those who play more than one [7] .

AfriForum, an organization linked to the largely white Afrikaans speaking trade union Solidariteit, has criticized the measure and has suggested it might be against the rules of the world governing body [8] , the International Rugby Board, whose by-law 3 prohibits racial discrimination [9] .

[1] All references to “rugby” in this debate refer to the union form of the sport, which is more popular worldwide and in South Africa. There is another form of the sport, rugby league, which has popularity primarily in Australia, parts of England and New Zealand, which arose from a division in the sport in 1895, which has a number of key differences in its rules. The author had tried to phrase this debate in terms that don’t require much, if any, knowledge of the rules of rugby.

[2] “Springboks” was the typical nickname for South African sports teams, after the animal that was a national symbol of the country under white minority rule. Following the transition to democratic government, most sports teams have dropped it
