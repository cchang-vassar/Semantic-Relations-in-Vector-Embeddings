Major League Baseball (MLB), often referred to as “America’s national pastime,” differs from some other team sports—such as American football, rugby, and ice hockey—in largely seeking to avoid forceful physical contact between players. The rules of baseball largely prohibit players from attempting to crash into or otherwise physically incapacitate opponents. There is, however, one notable exception: collisions at home plate.

These collisions occur when a runner attempts to score by reaching home plate before the catcher (the defensive player responsible for covering home) receives a throw from elsewhere on the field and tags the runner out. A catcher is permitted to block the path of the runner trying to score if the catcher has the baseball in his possession or if he is about to receive a throw. (Otherwise, the catcher may not block home plate.) Runners, in turn, are permitted to collide with the catcher in order to reach home plate, or to jar the ball loose from the catcher’s possession; either of those outcomes would allow the runner to score.

Catchers wear protective gear, including a chest protector, helmet, and shin guards (though they tend to remove their face mask when receiving throws, supposedly because it limits their range of vision). Runners have only a helmet, though they tend to be running at top speed at the time of a collision, whereas the catcher is stationary and sometimes is unable to observe the runner’s approach because his attention is focused on receiving the throw.

These collisions at home plate have occasionally resulted in serious injury. When injuries occur, they are usually—though not always—to the catcher. Famously, Hall of Fame player Pete Rose barrelled into catcher Ray Fosse in the 1970 All Star Game. Fosse was injured and was never the same player again, but the collision allowed Rose to score the winning run. More recently, in May 2011, the San Francisco Giants’ star catcher Buster Posey suffered a gruesome, season-ending leg injury when he was hit by Scott Cousins of the Florida Marlins. Cousins scored, helping the Marlins win the game. But the images of Posey’s injury sparked a debate about whether such collisions should be permitted.

Those who oppose crashes differ in precisely how they would change the rules, but the most common proposal is to require the runner to slide, just as they must do when attempting to reach other bases. Another option is to disallow catchers to block runners’ paths. Most of the arguments in this debate do not depend on the specific proposal.
