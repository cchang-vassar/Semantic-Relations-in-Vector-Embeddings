The UEFA Euro 2012 tournament is being jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine. The football is scheduled to start on 8 th June with a match between Poland and Greece and it will run until 1 st July. The Final will be held in the Olympic Stadium in Kyiv the capital of Ukraine. This will put Ukraine in the spotlight throughout the tournament as leaders regularly attend international tournaments to show their support for their national team and sometimes engage in some international diplomacy on the side. There have however been calls for Europe’s leaders to not attend, to boycott, those games that are to be held in Ukraine. [1] German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been campaigning for a mass boycott by European leaders [2] and she has been joined by the Austrians. [3] Others such as the European Commission President Barroso and British Foreign Minister William Hague have said they will be staying away without explicitly stating that they are boycotting the tournament. [4] The furore has been caused by the conviction of Yulia Timoshenko on charges of criminally exceeding her authority over a 10-year gas contract signed with Russia in January 2009. Timoshenko and her supporters claim it was a politically motivated show trial and an attempt by the President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych to prevent his main rival from contesting elections in the future. [5] Timoshenko went on hunger strike in April having accused prison guards of beating her and fearing that the Ukrainian authorities would attempt to have her killed. Although Timoshenko ended her hunger strike on 9 th May the international fallout continues. [6]
