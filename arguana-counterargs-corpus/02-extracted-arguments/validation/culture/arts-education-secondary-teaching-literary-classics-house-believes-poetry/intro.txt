Poetry is a literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic an evocative qualities as well as the language's normal meaning. Poetry dates back as far as any literature, to the first civilization in Mesopotamia with the Sumerian epic Gilgamesh. It undoubtedly has a long pedigree but that does not mean it should be taught in schools. Can we justify keeping this subject obligatory for failing schools and schools under special measures? At the moment poetry is part of the English national curriculum where only essential skills, often called the three R's are considered essential. These are reading, writing and arithmetic. None the less unlike the skills these subjects mostly teach it cannot be considered a life skill. Poetry unlikely to be necessary for daily life after a student has left school. Poetry is currently taught at all levels of education from primary school up until students are allowed to drop key subjects after GCSEs.
