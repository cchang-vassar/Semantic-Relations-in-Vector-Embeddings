The Western World is getting fatter. Obesity and being overweight are the 5 th largest cause of death in the world[1]. 44% of diabetes, 23% of coronary heart disease, and 7-41% of some kinds of cancer deaths can be attributed to obesity[2]. One of the factors that contributes to obesity is the amount of energy in the food that is eaten Fats have twice as much energy for the same weight as protein and carbohydrates (9 calories per gram compared to 4)[3].

Could taxes on high fat foods, aiming to discourage their consumption, reduce obesity? Such a tax has been tried in Hungary [4] and Denmark [5], and it has been suggested in other counties.

N.B. This is a junior version of the Debatabase debate ‘ This house would implement a fat tax ’ for people who are in school. The original version has more explanation, detail, evidence and references.
