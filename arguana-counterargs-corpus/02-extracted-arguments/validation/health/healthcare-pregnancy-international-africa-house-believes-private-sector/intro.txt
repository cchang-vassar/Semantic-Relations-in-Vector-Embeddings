The commitment to improving healthcare can be seen by the prevalence of health indicators in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). This has resulted in innovative models, and thinking, on healthcare. The MDG provide a means for monitoring national progress in tackling multiple dimensions of poverty [1] . The defined goals encourage intervention to enable equality in health care, ensure a healthy population, and promote healthy environments. However, Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be far from reaching the MDG targets (UNDP, 2013).

In seeking to achieve the predefined goals the role of the private sector [2] has received increasing attention. Questions have been raised as to what the private sector can do to assist in eradicating poverty; how the private-sector is enticing innovative models of care; and why targeting the goals need to move beyond state intervention. The private-sector has played a key role within the distribution, and provision, of health care in Africa(McKinsey, 2007). Further, the rise of an urban middle class has encouraged a new market towards care. Willing to pay for care and demanding better care, the middle-class are encouraging a shift towards continuing privatisation.

This debate focuses on the relation between health and privatisation. With the public-sector underfunding health care, and a rise in consumers opting for private healthcare, what conclusions can be made? The debate returns to the issue of social policy in Africa - its importance and the need for new ideas.

[1] The MDG incorporate eight goals (see UNDP); recognising ‘poverty’ is not simply measurable in economic terms, but as freedom and social. ‘Health’ remains explicit in three goals; and implicit in the remaining five. The goals applicability has been widely criticised; however, in this case, the focus is on the process of achieving them.

[2] The private-sector includes a broad range of actors, ranging between formal and informal, for-profit and non-profit, insurers and manufacturers.
