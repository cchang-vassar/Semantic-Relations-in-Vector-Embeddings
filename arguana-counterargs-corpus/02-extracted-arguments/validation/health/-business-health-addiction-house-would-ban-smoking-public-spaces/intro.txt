Loosely speaking, "smoking bans" mean it is illegal in that country to smoke tobacco in workplaces and other public places, e.g., in hospitals or hotels, to prevent the health problems that can arise as a result of accidentally inhaling other people's cigarette smoke. However, of the countries that have smoking bans, there is wide variation in what public places are actually included. For example, smoking is banned in all restaurants in Berlin, but in Austria large establishments are allowed to have separate rooms for smokers 1. In Japan, only some companies (like McDonald's) ban smoking in their buildings 2, whereas in China a ban introduced in 2011 means smoking is illegal in all enclosed public spaces 3.

As well as these differences between countries that do have smoking bans, there are some countries where there are not yet any restrictions on smoking in public places. These countries include Costa Rica 4 and Jamaica 5, where bans are still only in consideration.

Because of this variation across the globe, it is important to discuss the reasons for and against having smoking banned in public places, and what kinds of places should be included. However, for simplicity's sake, this debate will discuss whether smoking should be banned in all enclosed public places.
