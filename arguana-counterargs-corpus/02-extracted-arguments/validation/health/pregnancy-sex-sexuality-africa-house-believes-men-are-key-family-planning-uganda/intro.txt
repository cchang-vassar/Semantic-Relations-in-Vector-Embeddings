In 2050 the global population is set to stand at 8.9 million (UN-Population, 2004). Africa, as a whole, will account for 20% of the world’s population by 2050. Such figures have raised concern within discussions on development and the environment. How can the rising population continue to sustain itself? Theories have previously been used to express how populations interact with the environment. Firstly, Malthusian and Neo-Malthusian perspectives emphasise the environmental sets limits to growth. A population size can only be sustained over time as long as it doesn’t rise over the environmental threshold limit to growth. Secondly, and alternatively, Boserup’s theory suggests that when faced with scarce environmental resources we make adaptations over time. The growth in a population can be met with technological, and political, alterations to its environment to adapt and sustain expansion. Following such ideas raises the question: what action should be taken to control the rising demands made on diminishing resources? One such strategy is family planning.

Family planning schemes have been implemented across Africa. The implementation of family planning has been justified through environmental, gender, and economical, discourses. This can mean presenting family planning as an effective means to control the population demand on scarce resources; empower; and offer an opportunity to reduce vulnerabilities within livelihoods. However, a key critique raised against family planning approaches is how it should be approached. The case of Uganda raises interesting debate. Uganda’s approach has called for the direct inclusion of men. Often in family planning women are targeted as the recipients, distributors, and key actors, within family planning in Africa. However, in Uganda’s approach family planning works across gender. Family planning is a service provided by the government along with international actors such as the UN population fund(Heuler, 2012). The service involves providing a range of short and long-term contraceptive methods (i.e. distributing condoms and injections; or providing education and advice). Both men and women are called upon, to understand and be aware of what measures to take.

This debate returns to the concept of family planning and how it is applied in the case of Uganda, to question whether bringing in men is the right approach. In doing so investigation is provided into what family planning is; whether it should be used; and whether the problem is who is involved.
