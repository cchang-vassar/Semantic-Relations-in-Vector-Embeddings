In his book The Death of Punishment, Robert Blecker proposes that prison conditions should vary, based on the offences that a person is convicted of; those who have committed more heinous crimes should have harsher prison conditions. Currently prison sentences are calibrated to fit the crime by their length, rather than their conditions.

Blecker supports the death penalty for the worst of the worst, but if this is unavailable wishes a separate prison system for them. The system proposed by Blecker is a “permanent punitive situation” in which prision would deliberately be make “painful and unpleasant” for those whose crimes are heinous enough that they are “specially condemned by a jury to suffer this fate”, essentially for those who today in the United States would receive the death penalty.

The regime under PPS would include the sole food being nutraloaf (euphemistically referred to as “special management meal” by some), a foodstuff made to be tasteless and used as a disciplinary measure: the compatibility of punishing inmates by altering their food intake with the US constitution has been disputed [1] . “We should keep their visits to the constitutional minimum, and none would be contact visits, ever… They would labor daily, and exercise. But they would not be allowed to play.” It goes without saying they would have no access to computers or the TV. [2] Blecker proposes placing photographs of the victim of the offence the prisoner was convicted of in their cell, restricting visits the absolute minimum, minimizing showers to once per week, the constitutional minimum exercise and no association with other prisoners.

Blecker singles out for criticism the system of the US where he argues that counterintuitively the worst prisoners get the best treatment in prison. An action that draws Blecker’s ire in particular is the sight of prisoners serving life without parole (LWOP) playing baseball (note that while LWOP is, in theory, the second highest sentence after the death penalty, over 3,000 people in the US are serving LWOP for nonviolent drug and property offences. [3] Blecker would have such offenses in normal prisons) [4] . The problem, in part, is that those who are in prison longest are most able to obtain privileges for good behaviour. Even worse is Death Row as “They have it better than everybody else in the prison” to the point that Blecker quotes a lifer saying “I’d be better off killing an officer. Get better privileges if they moved me to the Row.” This is because the wardens “want to make the time as easy for them as we can because it makes it easy for us if it is easy for them.” [5]

In England and Wales, male prisoners are divided in to a number of categories based on factors including the type of crime, duration of sentence, escape risk and potential danger in escape. Categories A, B and C are closed prison categories, Category D is for those held in open prisons. Category A prisoners are subdivided in to further categories based on escape risk. Remand prisoners (those who have not been convicted of anything and await trial, but bail has been denied) are generally given some privileges that those convicted don’t have (for example, in general, wearing their own clothes). This is not always the case in the US.
