The rise in cohabitation before, or as an alternative to, marriage can be seen across the Western world. The number of unmarried couples rose from 1.4 million in 1996 to 2.3 million in 2006. [1] 13% of Finland’s population cohabits. [2] This social change has not been reflected in the law. When married couples divorce, the law intervenes to separate their property and assets in a way that is deemed to be fair (or as laid down in a pre-nuptial agreement). In some countries the court will investigate what is fair in the circumstances of the specific individuals, taking into account the two parties’ needs and contributions to the family (as in England and Wales) [3] . There is no similar provision for cohabiting couples. There have been cases where couples do not put their home in both of their names (for example if one person has worked and paid the mortgage whilst the other has raised the family and cared for the home) and where one party has consequently been left worse off upon separation. This is not a debate about giving money to look after children: almost all states have laws to oblige parents to provide for their children financially after separation. It is about whether long-term relationships should result in a division of property similar to that following marriage. The UK Law Commission suggested such a policy in 2007 [4] but it stalled following strong opposition from religious groups.
