The War in Darfur refers to the civil war taking place in Darfur, Sudan. Unlike the Second Sudanese Civil War, this is believed to be an ethnic, rather than a religious war, though it has racial overtones and grew out of the existing Sudanese Civil War.

The people of Darfur occupied an equivocal position in that other conflict. Like the Southerners they are black. Like the northern government and unlike their racial counterparts in the South, they are Muslim. They largely sided with the northern forces in the Civil War, but as the North moved towards a peace agreement, the Darfur tribes increasingly began to resent the neglect which they felt Khartoum showed to their influence. In February of 2003 they rose against the government,

Rather than making concessions, the Sudanese government sent in military forces. One side of the armed conflicts is composed mainly of the Sudanese military and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group recruited mostly from the Afro-Arab Abbala tribes of the northern Rizeigat region in Sudan. These tribes are mainly camel-herding nomads. The other side is composed of rebel groups, notably the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The Sudanese government, while publicly denying that it supports the Janjaweed, is accused of providing financial assistance to the militia, and of participating in joint attacks targeting civilians.

Complicating matters is a history of conflict between the nomadic Abbala, and the historically settled Zaghawa and Masalit, which has embittered the conflict and increased the impression that if the genocide is not the policy of Khartoum it may well be that of its proxies.

Western intervention is harder than it may seem. For one thing, its unclear if the Sudanese government could gain control of the situation even if it wished to. Having armed the Janaweed, any effort to crush them would likely face Khartoum with a two-front war. Furthermore, Darfur is isolated, and there are no clear ways to support an international force even with Sudanese support. With official opposition it might well have been impossible.

The Darfur conflict is essentially over for the moment at least. A Darful Peace Agreement was drawn up by mediators at the Doha Peace Forum in 2011. This was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement on 14 July 2011. [1] This means that this debate is really a post-mortem about whether more should have been done more. There is unlikely to be any debates about what the United States should do in Darfur however it may be a useful example for similar cases in the future.
