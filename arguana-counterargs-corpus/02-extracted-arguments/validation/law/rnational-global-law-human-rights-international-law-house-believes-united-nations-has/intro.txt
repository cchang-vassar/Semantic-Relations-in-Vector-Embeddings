Throughout the 1990s, humanitarian disasters and perceived United Nations' failures in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Kosovo led to considerable discussion of the need for military intervention to stop atrocities among civilian populations, even though this would involve overriding traditional notions of state sovereignty. In 2000 a Canadian government initiative led to the creation of an International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS), which produced a report in 2001 calling for the recognition of a Responsibility to Protect citizens on the part of both national governments and the global community [1] . This drew on existing thinking in the 1948 International Convention against Genocide, in which the United Nations and its members committed themselves to take acts to prevent and punish genocide [2] . The ICISS Report went further, however, in arguing that a vital part of sovereignty was the responsibility of the state to protect its people, and that if a government was either deliberately targeting part of its population, or failing through inaction to protect them from serious harm, then it could not claim a sovereign right of non-interference to deflect mitigating protective action by the international community. In effect, R2P sought to remove ‘the license to kill’ from the understanding and practice of state sovereignty. The Commission then argued that if human rights were truly universal, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) against gross violations did not stop at state borders, but that the international communities were obliged to intervene to uphold these rights in particular cases of large scale loss of life or ethnic cleansing. The notion of state and international responsibility to protect was later adopted by the UN Secretary-General's High Level Panel, which argued in 2004 that the UN should take on a responsibility to protect when five criteria of legitimacy are met. [3] The five criteria were as follow; the harm was sufficient to constitute a ‘just cause’, the primary purpose of the military action was to halt or avert this threat (a ‘right intention’), the military option was a ‘last resort’, the means used were ‘proportional’ to the objective and finally, that the operation had a ‘reasonable prospect’ of success [4] . If those criteria could be met, they argued, the United Nations collectively, should act.
