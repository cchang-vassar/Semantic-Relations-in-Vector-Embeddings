Uganda hit the international headlines in late 2013 and early 2014 due to controversy over an anti-gay law proposed by parliament and passed by the president.

The initial bill commonly known as “kill the gays bill” was proposed by MP David Bahati in 2009 and approved by parliament in December 2013 before being sent to the state house for final confirmation. Mr Bahati argued that he would fight to see the bill passed claiming that it was aimed at protecting children and conserving the country’s values; “Because we are a God-fearing nation, we value life in a holistic way. It is because of those values that members of Parliament passed this bill regardless of what the outside world thinks”[1] he noted after the parliamentary vote to support the bill.

Despite international pressure from various countries such as the USA and UK as well as from humanitarian organisations worldwide to stop the progress of the bill Uganda’s President passed it as law in February 2014. President Museveni proclaimed he did so to show that Uganda is an independent country which won’t create laws just to suit other countries agendas [2].

The Anti-Homosexuality Act metes out jail terms of up to life for "aggravated homosexuality" while "aiding and abetting homosexuality" is punishable by seven year prison sentences. It includes penalties for individuals, companies, media organisations, or non-governmental organisations that reach out to gay people or support LGBT rights. Individuals can be sentenced to seven years in jail. Organisations will be shut down.

The response from around the world has mostly been critical. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke against the law stressing that it violates basic human rights and endangers the LGBT community in Uganda[3]. South Africa’s Nobel peace prize winner Desmond Tutu argued that there is no scientific justification for prejudice and discrimination ever, and called on Museveni to strengthen Uganda's culture of human rights and justice[4]. President Obama in a written statement against the move noted; the new law “will be more than an affront and a danger to the gay community in Uganda. It will be a step backward for all Ugandans and reflect poorly on Uganda's commitment to protecting the human rights of its people”. It is therefore a question of concern, has the Ugandan government failed its citizens on LGBT rights?
