Especially since the end of World War II, there have been calls for a global system of justice and an effort to prevent massive atrocities from occurring. Tribunals to prosecute crimes committed in Yugoslavia and Rwanda brought up the question of whether a permanent court would be beneficial. The International Criminal Court (ICC) was born out of these efforts to recognize an international court on July 1, 2002 with the founding of the Rome Statute to prosecute crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes. The Rome Statute states that the court also has jurisdiction over crimes of aggression, but lacks a definition of what constitutes those crimes and thus will only have the ability to prosecute them when there is an amendment passed. The ICC differs from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in that the ICJ tries legal disputes between countries; the ICC is specific to individuals. The ICC is a permanent court that will try individuals if either a) the Security Council refers a case to the court, or b) if the state on whose territory the crime was committed/the state of the accused's nationality has ratified the Rome Statute. Thus, the ICC relies on the cooperation of member states to find and apprehend criminals. The Security Council's role in the court was a contentious issue during the conference held to draft the Rome Statute and remains one of the issues with the court today; currently, the Security Council can either refer cases or delay them for 12 months an unlimited number of times. The ICC prosecutor may investigate cases based upon information from reliable sources other than the Security Council such as non-governmental organizations, victims, etc. 1

Currently, 115 countries have ratified the Rome Statute and another 34 have signed but not ratified the treaty. Proponents argue that the ICC is a necessary step to fight heinous crimes and institute justice while deterring crime in an increasingly globalized world. Other nations who oppose the ICC, such as the United States, China, and Russia cite issues of sovereignty and abuse. Possible alternatives to the ICC include individual tribunals and reconciliation programs. This debate questions whether the ICC should be accepted by nations and consequently whether states should ratify the Rome Statute.
