Intelligence services provide the government with essential information to make decisions in regards to threats to national security. There are three sources of threats to national security and therefore three ‘target areas’ for intelligence: domestic, foreign and military. In many countries (but not all), each target area has its own specific agency: for example, the UK has MI5 for domestic intelligence, SIS (also known as MI6) for foreign intelligence and DIS (Defence Intelligence Staff) for military intelligence. The intelligence services usually perform the following four types of activities: intelligence gathering, analysis, counter-intelligence and covert action.

There are several methods of intelligence gathering, including ‘using personal contact’ such as paid informants, planting agents within organisations, etc. (called HUMINT, Human INTelligence), inferring information from electronic signals (called SIGINT, SIGnals INTelligence) and more. Counterintelligence refers to the activities employed by intelligence agencies/governments to prevent other countries/actors from successfully gathering intelligence against them. Covert action is when an intelligence agency engages in clandestine operations against a target.

To protect national security, intelligence agencies are given broad and exceptional powers. Exercising these powers can clash with citizens’ basic rights. In this casefile, I will explore this tension between national security and basic rights by focussing on the case for domestic intelligence in a democracy. The case for military and foreign intelligence in a democracy is more straightforward and more easily justified, but many of the arguments against domestic intelligence agencies could also apply against foreign and military intelligence. Does domestic intelligence have a place in a functioning democracy and is it an infringement on this democracy?
