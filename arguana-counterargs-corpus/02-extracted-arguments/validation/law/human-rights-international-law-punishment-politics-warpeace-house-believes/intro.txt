Popular demonstrations started in Syria in March and April 2011 as part of the Arab Spring movement that swept across large areas of the Middle East. This deteriorated in to a civil war. [1]

Both sides, the Assad government and to a lesser extent the rebels [2] , have been accused of grave human rights abuses. This includes including the use of chemical weapons against civilians, most likely by the Assad regime as they are the ones with control over chemical weapons [3] , as well as the deliberate targeted killing of civilians [4] , and widespread rapes [5] . The rebels have been accused of summary killings of soldiers and civilians they have captured, including an incident caught on video where a boy, whose age would make him a child soldier under the Rome Statute, kills a Syrian Colonel with a machete [6] .

This has led to calls for military intervention by the US and France, with some support from the British government, who lost a Parliamentary vote on the issue. This is a course of action opposed by China and Russia.

However, there have been suggestions, including by the British government [7] and Human Rights Watch [8] that the case should be referred to the International Criminal Court to put various figures in the conflict, likely including Bashar al-Assad on trial. If he were to go on trial at the ICC, he would be one of a small number of former heads of state, including Charles Taylor and Slobodan Milosevic, to have been tried before an international court.

Neither Syria, or Lebanon, which is being affected by overspill of the conflict, have ratified the Rome Statute to the International Criminal Court. Therefore, in order for this to be added to the jurisdiction of the ICC, a reference by the UN Security Council would be necessary.
