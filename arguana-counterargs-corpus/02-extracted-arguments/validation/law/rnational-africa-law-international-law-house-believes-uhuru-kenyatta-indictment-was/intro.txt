On the first of July 2002 the Rome Statute that formed the International Criminal Court (ICC) came into force. The ICC was needed to try the most serious war crimes and crimes against humanity when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves but this inevitably means there will be conflicts between the individual sovereignty of nations, and a court that wishes to try their nationals outside of their domestic justice system. The ICC as an independent international organisation, outside of the United Nations system running on funding from state parties is able to conduct its own investigations, but still needs cooperation from the states parties for the arrest of those who violate international criminal law. In order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the ICC needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the United Nations Security Council (being made up by the US, France, Russia, China and the UK), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves.

In the case of Uhuru Kenyatta Kenya referred the case to the ICC itself. The case was the result of violence after disputed elections in 2007 which pitted the Kikuyu ethnic group’s party the Party of National Unity lead by Mwai Kibabi against the Orange Democratic Movement mostly made up of Kalenjins and Luos with Raila Odinga as their candidate. Odinga’s party believed they had been cheated of the election leading to protest, and violence; an estimated 1200 were killed and 600,000 fled their homes. [1] Those accused of instigating the violence are Uhuru Kenyatta on the PNU side and William Ruto and Joshua Sang for the ODM. Kenya conducted an investigation, the Waki Commission, but the Kenyan Parliament refused to act on its advice to create a special tribunal so the information from the commission was passed to the ICC in July 2009. With this information the ICC prosecutor invoked proprio motu powers to launch an investigation without a prior request from the UNSC or Kenya. Charges for crimes against humanity against Kenyatta, Ruto, Sang and one other, Francis Muthaura, were confirmed on 8 th March 2011. [2]

Politically however the situation is difficult for the ICC. Despite having been on opposite sides in 2007 in the next elections in 2013 Kenyatta and Ruto had put their differences behind them to form a coalition. This coalition won the 2013 elections, though by a close margin and not without dispute, making Kenyatta the fourth president of Kenya and Ruto his Deputy. Ruto’s trial has already begun, though it was interrupted by the attack on the Westgate shopping center. [3] Kenyatta’s trial is set to take place in 2014 though it is being delayed. [4] Both Ruto and Kenyatta have stated they are willing to cooperate but have criticized the court calling it “a painfully farcical pantomime” and a “toy of declining imperial powers” while the African Union has called for immunity for all sitting leaders, and for the indictment of Kenyatta to be dropped [5] .
