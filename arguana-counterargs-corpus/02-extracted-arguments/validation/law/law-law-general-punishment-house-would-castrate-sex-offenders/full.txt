# THESIS
This House would castrate sex offenders


# INTRO
Many people consider sexual abuse one of the worst crimes a person can commit. In these circumstances, it has been proposed by some that such an offender should be punished, normally in addition to a jail term, by castration. Castration is the removal of the sex glands, and is normally defined as a chemical process, using hormones to render them impotent. The goal of such an operation would be to remove the sexual drive of sex offenders which, proponents of the procedure advocate, would drastically reduce the chances of re-offending. Opponents of the punishment argue, in contrast, that the punishment does not fit the crime and that it would not deter sex offenders once freed.
