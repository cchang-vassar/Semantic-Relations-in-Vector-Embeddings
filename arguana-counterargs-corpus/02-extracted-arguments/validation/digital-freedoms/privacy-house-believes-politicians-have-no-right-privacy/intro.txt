The right to privacy is enshrined in constitutions and law around the world. But what are its limits? Politicians, the elected representatives of the people often claim the right to privacy, but many suggest that the right should not apply to those who serve the people in public office. The debate centres around two broad issues: first, whether the right to privacy is sacrosanct for all, or whether citizens right to know who they are electing overrides it, and second, whether the elimination of politicians’ right to privacy would make them better at their jobs and improve governance generally.

This debate emerges from a context of scandals in the private lives of many public figures that have arisen over the years. While some have to do with secondary aspects of private conduct, such as religious opinion, most that draw attention focus on sex scandals of various sorts. The most famous, and one that will be considered in the debate, is the case of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski. [1] Another more contemporary example is the Petraeus sex scandal. [2] All of these personal misdeeds have exploded onto the public sphere and had significant impact on politicians’ careers and lives.

The following arguments seek to lay out the major branches of thought put forward by both sides in this age-old debate. In doing so it generally takes politicians to mean elected representatives, though the logic of most of the arguments applies to appointed posts in public service. By “no right to privacy” this debate means to discuss an umbrella of transparency and public scrutiny measures that would serve to reveal most aspects of politicians’ private lives, as well as to give justification to the practice of journalists of actively delving into the private lives of public figures. Different boundaries may exist, and the level of public scrutiny could be justified to varying degrees, but for ease of understanding and clarity of two-sided debate, the loss of the right to privacy might be considered here as being entirely abrogated by politicians.
