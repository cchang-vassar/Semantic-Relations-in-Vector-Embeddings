Modern day society relies more and more on electronic forms of communication for ease, speed and accessibility. A huge majority of citizens in developed countries have easy access to the internet, and internet access in developing countries is becoming more and more common [1] . Mobile phones provide another opportunity for developing countries; for example, in Kenya, the mobile baking company M-PESA has now provided a farmer in the Rift Valley the same banking opportunities as somebody living in a major city [2] . Thousands of people who become new mobile phone subscribers live in emerging markets [3] , and electronics have demonstrated an extraordinary power to connect communities. However, while banking and instant messaging have already taken off, simple actions such as voting in a local or general election must be done by traveling to a polling station and physically checking off a piece of paper. In both developed and developing countries, this can be a problem for those who live far away from a polling station [4] . Many people are beginning to ask whether this should change to online voting.

Electronic voting brings with it many complex issues. Electronic voting machines which have been trialed in the USA are still criticised, and their effectiveness and integrity have been questioned. [5] Some American states now demand that electronic voting systems must produce a paper record which can be checked manually if there are any doubts about the results [6] . This was a particularly prominent issue in the 2004 US Presidential election, where it is suspected that thousands of votes were actually lost by the machines [7] . However, even in states where these terminals are used, they are still located at the polling station [8] rather than allowing people to send in votes from their own homes.

This debate is concerned with the prospect of voting over the internet or via mobile phones, which is known as Remote Electronic Voting (REV) [9] . While no country has yet adopted REV as the main voting method, the UK conducted trials in 2003 [10] , and Arizona introduced internet voting for overseas citizens [11] . Despite this, there are still plenty of critics who stand against electronic voting and believe that it is an unreliable way of measuring votes [12] .

The proposition case must consider whether they intend to make all voting electronic, or whether only in certain cases. If all voting was electronic, then the current norm of local polling stations would be unnecessary, which would save a huge amount of time and money [13] . External voting alone costs many European countries millions of Euros for a relatively small proportion of the population [14] . However, performing all voting electronically raises questions about those who do not have home access to internet, and perhaps more importantly how the entirety of the vote could be completely accurate given problems experienced with this form of voting in the past. It is easier to defend a case which argues that internet and electronic voting is one option which should be enacted alongside traditional polling methods to benefit those who cannot or do not, for whatever reason, get to the polling stations to vote. If proposition chooses to use a mechanism which states that all voting must be done electronically, they take on an (unnecessary) burden to show that the software used is completely secure and cannot be infiltrated or suffer from technical complications which could compromise the elections, for example by losing votes. This is very difficult to prove as many experts believe that there is no computer (especially in a ‘distributed system’, or network of computers) which is completely and utterly impenetrable [15] . Given that a large part of the proposition case is extolling the virtues of voters having personal, home access to the internet and electronics, it would be impossible to avoid the networking connections between computers when conducting an election in this way. Therefore, it is more difficult to defend a case which states that all voting should be done electronically than defending a case which allows multiple forms of voting, of which electronic or internet voting is one.
