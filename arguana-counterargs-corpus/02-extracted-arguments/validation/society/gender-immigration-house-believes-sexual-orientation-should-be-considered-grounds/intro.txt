Asylum is “protection from arrest and extradition given especially to political refugees by a nation or by an embassy or other agency enjoying diplomatic immunity.” [1] Asylum can be best understood as protection a country grants an individual by means of granting them ‘refugee’ status and allowing them to live in their country without fear of persecution or prosecution from their home country. Asylum is granted in cases where there is a reasonable and immediate threat of what is deemed “unjust” harm or punishment by the receiving country if the individual being granted asylum were to return to their home country. The origin of the concept of Asylum is rooted in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees [2] and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees [3] . These international conventions were further supported by Resolution 2198 (XXI) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly [4] . The international organization that provides administrative and institutional support to asylum-seekers is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees [5] .

Mirroring a growing acceptance of difference in sexual orientation seen in most Western liberal democracies is a continued and violent lack of acceptance of “taboo” sexual practices in less socially-progressive areas of the world. Homosexuality, Bisexuality and Transgendered peoples are common targets of violence and hatred in much of the developing world [6] . In many parts of the world homosexuality is criminalized [7] and even carries the death penalty as punishment in many countries [8] . Early May 2011 saw Uganda’s parliament attempt to back a bill that would make the crime of homosexuality punishable by death [9] . Much of the world is an unsafe place for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered (LGBT) peoples and the discussion of asylum is centred on how to appropriately address this issue.
