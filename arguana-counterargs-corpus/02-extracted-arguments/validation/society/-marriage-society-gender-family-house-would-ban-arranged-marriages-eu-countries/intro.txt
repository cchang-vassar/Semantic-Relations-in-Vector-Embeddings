Although arranged marriages are an entrenched cultural norm in many European-Asian communities, there is still a lot of controversy over their practice. Although there are differences in the ways cultures carry them out, they can be broadly defined as forms of matrimony where the individuals involved are brought together by parents or family members, and not necessarily through their own choices. However they are different from forced marriages in the sense that arrange marriages can involve the consent of the man and woman at the centre.

Forced marriage was made punishable by law in the UK in early 2012. [1] Before then laws were introduced in Britain in 2008 allowing people to apply for Forced Marriage Protection Orders, where penalties for its breach can include up to two years in prison. [2] France also banned forced marriages and tried in recent years to discourage its continued usage via public education campaigns. [3]

Yet arranged marriages are practiced across societies in South Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, particularly in communities that are predominantly Hindu and Muslim. Many diaspora communities in Britain also practice them, and it was widespread among white Europeans for centuries. However many people in the West now see it as clashing far too much with more modern ideas of marriage where people often enter into matrimony independently of their families.

However, sympathisers claim that arranged marriages are not necessarily damaging or threatening to young men or women if they are not forced, and are a vital part of the cultural heritage and functioning of various diaspora communities in Europe.

As the use of forced marriage already carries strict penalties, this debate will focus purely on arranged marriages. The mechanism would be to outlaw marriages where the individuals at the centre have been introduced to each other by parents or relatives and had little or no contact with each other beforehand. Police officers, social workers and other public service workers would be made aware of the new regulations and be required to make those in their communities who might be vulnerable more aware of their rights.
