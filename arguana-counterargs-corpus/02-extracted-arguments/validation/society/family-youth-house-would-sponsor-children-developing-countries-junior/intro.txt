Sponsoring a child is a popular way of supporting charity work in the developing world - countries where people don’t have much money. Many charities run schemes which link a person in a more wealthy country (the donor, or sponsor) with a particular child in a developing country. The sponsor gives a little bit of money (a donation) every month to support that child, it’s usually between $20 and $40[1]. Some charities focus their sponsorship work on orphans, but most choose children living at home with their families, and the money is often spent by the charity rather than given directly to the child’s family. Usually the child benefits through education, health care, and perhaps food aid. Some charities use the sponsored children as a way of assisting a whole community, while others focus more on the individual child and their family.

Communication is an important part of sponsorship schemes. As well as their regular donations, sponsors usually send letters to the child they are supporting, and perhaps occasional gifts. In return they can expect to receive regular reports and photographs from the charity about the child’s progress and how their money is making a difference to his or her life. Often the child is also expected to write to their sponsor, if they are able to do so.

Although sponsorship is a major source of funding for charities working overseas, it does have critics. Most of the largest aid agencies choose not to offer child sponsorship schemes, this discussion looks at why that is, and whether or not sponsorship is a good form of charitable giving.
