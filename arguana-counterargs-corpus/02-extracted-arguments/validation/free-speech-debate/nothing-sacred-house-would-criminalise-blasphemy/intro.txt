The case study: England’s last blasphemy trial

Blasphemy is the act of showing contempt or speaking offensively about a deity or of persons and symbols regarded as sacred by the followers of a specific religion. The concept of blasphemy is mostly associated with the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) and many nation states which affiliate with one of these have, at one time or another, created laws against committing blasphemous acts directed at their dominant religious tradition.

As the world in general becomes more liberal and secular however the need for such laws has come into question. In a number of European states, blasphemy laws still exist in common law and statute, but are left dormant and unused. Censorship and classification bodies in western liberal democracies may be permitted to take account of statements or images that may be blasphemous when deciding whether films or broadcast media should be cut or certified.

Contrary to assertions that the idea of blasphemy no longer has a significant influence on free speech within western liberal democracies, in 2007 an attempt was made by a Christian campaigning group to sue the producers of the music Jerry Springer: the opera for blasphemous libel. Jerry Springer featured an appearance by a character strongly resembling Jesus, who admitted to being “a little bit gay”. On 31 March 2012 it was announced that the film Visions of Ecstasy would be released on DVD in the UK, after the film was banned from cinemas by the British Board of Film Classification in 1989. Visions, based on the life of the Christian mystic St Teresa if Alvila, portrayed female actresses and an actor representing a crucified Christ in a number of highly sexualized scenes. Following initial attempts to release the film, the conservative MP Graham Bright openly called for its negative print to be destroyed.

Although laws allowing prosecution of the producers of blasphemous material were repealed in the United Kingdom in 2008, blasphemy laws are still strongly enforced in many Muslim states. The parliament of the small gulf state of Kuwait voted in April 2012 to allow the death sentenced to be imposed on anyone successfully prosecuted of blasphemy in a Kuwaiti court. Hamad al-Naqi, a Kuwaiti citizen was arrested earlier in the year for allegedly publishing blasphemous comments on the social networking site Twitter. On April 19 he was repeatedly stabbed by another inmate of the prison where he was being held pending his trial.

On 03 May a Tunisian court is due to hand down a verdict in a blasphemy prosecution mounted against one of the Arab states private television broadcaster, Nessma TV. The case followed the broadcast of the film Persepolis, which recounts a young Iranian girl’s perspective on the country’s islamist revolution of 1979. Politically engaged Salafist Tunisians perceived the broadcast of the film as an attack against Islam and Tunisian’s moderate Ennahda political movement. Secular middle and upper class Tunisians, many of whom were connected to the authoritarian regime of the country’s ousted dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, have portrayed support for the prosecution as an attack on free speech and Tunisian’s broadly liberal academic traditions.

“ The philosopher J B Bury referred to laws that instituted religious toleration as an “imperfect” form of liberty. Bury thought that imperfect or limited religious liberty was preferable in plural societies, as it limited possible conflicts between groups with competing religious claims. Religious tolerance is closely interlinked with blasphemy, as historical, moral, ethical, legal or cosmological claims made by one religion can often be seen as a direct attack on similar claims made by other religions.

As noted above, many religions call for the persecution or, at the very least, condemnation of anyone who chooses to make a blasphemous statement. Allowing members of these religions to exercise a full range of religious liberty would entail allowing them to act against statements that they identified as blasphemous. In a multi-cultural society that permits freedom of conscience, such a policy would inevitably lead to conflict.

Anti-blasphemy laws often manifest themselves in states that contain a majority population of individuals who actively practice a particular religion. Official recognition of blasphemy laws is often described as being derived from a popular mandate – states such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia claim that their citizens want to see blasphemy laws based on religious proscriptions enforced, and that their executive and judicial authorities are doing nothing more than carrying out citizens’ demands. Indeed, some forms of blasphemy law may do nothing more than recognize and regularize norms that already exist in certain societies. But this position becomes problematic when these values and ideals are used to persecute groups who lie outside of the majority religion that enforces them.

In November 2010 Asia Bibi, a Christian Pakistani, was sentenced to death for blaspheming against Islam. The accusation of blasphemy followed an incident during which Ms Bibi was attacked by a mob, following accusations that she had “dirtied” drinking water used by Muslim women in her village. A prominent Pakistani cleric later announced an $8000 reward for her death.

This, and similar cases, provide some of the most extreme examples of the chilling effect that laws which restrict speech can have on the development of a society. Although states may aim to give official recognition to blasphemy laws that may already exist in communities under their control as a means of regulating and tempering their use, official recognition often serves to do nothing more than strengthen zealots’ causes and justify acts of violence directed at non-conformists.

Many religious scholars, such as Al Shaffi in the Islamic tradition, and the Christian theologian Erasmus have openly espoused toleration for dissenters within a faith and for those “outside” a particular religion who profess alternative religious ideas. Both recognized that social stability and the progress and development of centralized and increasingly cosmopolitan societies could only be achieved by implementing religious tolerance of a form similar to the “recognition respect” described in Timothy Garton Ash’s article on freedom of religious expression.

Often, recognition of this kind of freedom of expression can be influenced by external factors that affect the structure of particular societies. As both Garton Ash and Bury point out, freedom of religious expression and belief has been a frequent subject of debate throughout India’s history. India- to this day- comprises a wide range of communities, ethnicities and religious traditions. The durability of any monarch or ruling power within the sub-continent has always been contingent on official support for limitations on religions’ ability to react to perceived blasphemies or slights.

Historical experience has proven the efficacy of such policies. With the world becoming increasingly plural, mobile and multi-cultural, now is the time to revisit and refresh these principles, and to position them prominently in public discourse. - Alexander Cavell
