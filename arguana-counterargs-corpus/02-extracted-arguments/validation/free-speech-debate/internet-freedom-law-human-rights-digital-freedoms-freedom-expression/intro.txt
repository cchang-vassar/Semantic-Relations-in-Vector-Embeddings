Repressive governments, here defined as governments that are anti-democratic, that do not afford general civil rights to their citizens, and that do not have a robust respect for the rule of law, have sought to quell dissent and the voices of reform by many means. Through a sophisticated security apparatus, states have succeeded in making most forms of physical protest extremely difficult. Demonstrations and clandestine organization are suppressed with the same vigour and effectiveness. Countries like China, North Korea, Cuba, and Iran have all developed these strategies with precision.

One of the only avenues people in these countries feel capable of turning to is in the blogosphere. Bloggers are at the forefront of the battle for political rights in China and Cuba. But their zeal often leads them to fall foul of the government, and many end up harassed by state agents, or even in prison. In Vietnam bloggers have been reporting on crackdowns on house churches and other human rights abuses. The response is surveillance and ‘working sessions’ with police interrogators. [1] Bloggers such as Nguyen Van Hai, Ta Phong Tan, and Phanh Thanh Hai were jailed for ‘anti-state propaganda’ and Nguyen Hoang Vi beaten and stripped by police officers. In all such cases no matter what country the government seeks to undermine the writers by accusing them of wicked plots, treason, and manipulation by outside power. [2]

The appropriate response to all this that This House, defined broadly as democratic states and narrowly as the Western liberal democracies, should adopt in response to all this is contentious. This debate focuses on the decision to offer amnesty to those facing prosecution in their native countries. This policy has been implemented to various degrees already in some countries, with the United States, for example, housing dissidents from China, Cuba, and elsewhere. But whether this is good policy, whether it should be expanded or ended, remains to be seen.
