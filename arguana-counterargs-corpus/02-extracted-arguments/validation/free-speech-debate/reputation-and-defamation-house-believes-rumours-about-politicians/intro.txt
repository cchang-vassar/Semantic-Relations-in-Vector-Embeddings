The case: The Mexican journalist and the "alcoholic" president

Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui was fired for publicly calling on President Felipe Calderón to clarify rumours that he suffered from alcoholism, writes Felipe Correa.

In February 2011, the well-known Mexican journalist, Carmen Aristegui, was dismissed for violating broadcasting company MVS Multivisión’s ethical code. It was alleged that Aristegui disseminated rumours as news. During her radio programme she reported that deputies from the opposition party unfurled a banner inside the Mexican Congress that said: “Would you let a drunk drive your car? Of course not! So why do you let one run the country?” Members of the governing party decided to leave the plenary hall in protest against the insult to the president.

After the report, Aristegui said there was no evidence to confirm whether President Felipe Calderón did have problems with alcohol. However, she emphasised that it was a delicate topic that needed formal clarification. “This deserves a serious, formal, and official response from the presidency of the republic,” she said . Aristegui added that in democracies around the world, the well-being of heads of states was in the public interest.

Two days after this event, MVS broadcast a formal message dismissing Aristegui on air. Her dismissal sparked a lively debate on social media networks and the media. Two weeks later, MVS revoked the dismissal, stating that Aristegui’s programme would continue and the case would be subjected to an arbitration process to settle the dispute. After that Aristegui continued working for MVS and remains conducting the show nowadays.

Author opinion

This case reminds me of one occurred in 2004, when a New York Times journalist, Larry Rohter, wrote a story about Lula da Silva, the president of Brazil at that time. In this story, Rohter alleged that Lula had problems with alcoholism. In response, Lula tried to expel Rohter from the country.

Allegations that politicians have problems with alcohol are common but rarely evidence-based, leading often to libel. However, in the case that occurred in Mexico it seems to me that the journalist was just commenting on an act that happened in the Mexican Congress, and asking for clarification from the president. Commenting on an event occurring in Congress is different from claiming something in an investigative story. In the case of Rother, he did not report an event. He did an investigation and wrote a story insinuating (giving no evidences, but rumours) that the Brazilian president suffered from alcoholism. In the case of Aristegui, it is clear to me that it was not defamation and she shouldn’t have been dismissed

Debaters’ Note

This is one specific example of a very common type of debate referred to as ‘public figures / private lives’. It is also a huge issue in discussions about freedom of speech and the independence of the press. If a politician is an alcoholic, or having an affair, or is gay, or takes drugs or a million other things does the public have any right to know? More to the point in this case, if it is just gossip is there a public interest in it being more widely known that such gossip is taking place in political and journalistic circles?

Usually the issue comes down to whether;

A) The politician is being a hypocrite – backing homophobic legislation while at the same time living with a gay partner.

B) The issue is affecting the politician’s performance at work – missing meetings because she is drunk or hungover.

C) There is a possibility that the politician could be threatened with the release of the information – either though blackmail or internal political horse-trading. It’s worth noting, the allegation doesn’t really need to be true for this to be a threat.

D) Finally, can the journalist prove that there is a matter of public interest. Remember that the public interest is something much more than the public just being curious about a scandal – it means that there is a provable reason for revealing the information.

In the light of this, these arguments have been kept deliberately broad but are set within the confines of the case set out above.
