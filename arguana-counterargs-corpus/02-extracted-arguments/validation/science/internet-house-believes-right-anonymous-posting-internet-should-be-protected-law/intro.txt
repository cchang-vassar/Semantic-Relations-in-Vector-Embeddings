Anonymous posting on the internet is where someone posts something on an online bulletin board, internet forum, blog or comment and is allowed and able to remain anonymous – either because he or she doesn’t have to give up any identifiable information (like a pseudonym or email) or because he or she is allowed to give a non-identifiable pseudonym.

There are different ways in which someone can remain anonymous or can be identified online. To understand these different ways, it’s important to understand something of the technical process of communicating online. From the hardware perspective, the internet is a ‘network of networks’: a vast network of large and small computers connected to each other via cable and wireless signals. The network is ever changing: whenever someone goes online, their computer connects to the network. When they turn off their computer, it’s disconnected from the network. Whenever someone visits a website, the user’s computer connects via the network to the computer where the website is hosted and downloads the website to the local computer. The user could then log in to the website or just read it.

There are several steps in this process which can help in identifying an internet user. The first step is the assignment of an ‘IP address’. As soon as a computer connects to the internet, it gets an IP address. This address is unique to the local computer, which means that with the IP address someone else can trace from which computer someone was accessing or sending certain information. If that computer is your home computer, than tracing the IP address is a pretty certain way of discovering where exactly you live.

Identifying an IP-address is not the same as identifying the sender of information. There are several ways in which someone can remain anonymous as the sender of information. For example, people can hire computers (usually from commercial firms) to host information from. The host-computer (called ‘server’) then resides somewhere else – the only way to then trace hosted information to a sender is via a legal paper trail, for example by requiring legal identification for everyone who wants to hire server space.

But even then not all information is necessarily traceable to the sender of information. Take email, for example: email is sent through a specific software protocol called SMTP. Whenever you send an email from within an email program (not a browser), it typically leaves traces in several different places on the way, allowing the sender to be identified.

Apart from identifying the sender, the route between sender and receiver of information provides another step through which an internet user can or can’t be identified. Whenever you access a webpage, the server (the computer where the webpage ‘lives’) sends the webpage to your computer in packets. These packets get assembled back to the complete webpage by your computer. Each packet can take a different route: the packets ‘know’ your IP address so they know where they are heading, but they can take different routes to enable them to take the shortest route with the least congestion. This process of ‘routing’ can be anonymised: by placing an intermediary anonymising server on the route between sender and receiver through which packets are forced to travel and from which identifying information can then be stripped.

A final way of identifying someone online is by requiring people to identify themselves whenever they log into a website. An example is Facebook: Facebook requires users to provide ‘real names’. Other sites allow people to comment anonymously.

These different technical means of identifying someone online mean that there have been different proposals of curbing internet anonymity. We will identify the different proposals when relevant in the arguments.
