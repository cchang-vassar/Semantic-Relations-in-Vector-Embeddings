June and July 2013 brought a large number of revelations about the size of surveillance by the National Security Agency, the US intelligence agency that deals with monitoring communications around the world. While it was known that the internet was monitored it was not known to what extent, the leaks showed that such surveillance was indiscriminate essentially hovering in much of the internet for analysis, so much that the data is often held for only a few days. The revelations also applied to other countries agencies such as the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters.

On the 5 th June a court order by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court was published. This showed that Verizon was being forced to hand over all telephony metadata to the National Security Agency. This included “session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, International Mobile station Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers, and time and duration of call… [however] metadata does not include the substantive content of any communication”. [1]

This was however just the start. A program called PRISM was revealed the next day. The PRISM program allows collection of data on via a large number online services run by US companies including Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook among others. The companies provide structured information that is easy for the NSA to search and analyse through the PRISM program.

A couple of months later information of another program called XKeyscore were published in the Guardian newspaper. XKeyscore is apparently the NSA’s widest reaching system that covers "nearly everything a typical user does on the internet", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata. [2] This is a data retrieval system that lets the NSA search other sources, particularly all the unstructured information they hoover up from tapping into the fiber optic cables that enter and leave the United States allowing access to almost all internet traffic. [3]

The response to this spying has of course been outrage, but most of that outrage has been internal; that the spying is so indiscriminate it means that the National Security Agency is spying on Americans and so breaching their fourth amendment rights. However no one is particularly bothered about whether the United States should be using these programs against other countries – the implicit assumption is yes it should. [4]

The United States clearly gets an immense amount of data out of its dragnets of information on the internet but what is more questionable is whether such programs are actually a benefit to the country. Most nations manage with much smaller amounts of worldwide surveillance and there was outrage across many countries at the extent of the surveillance. The actions of the NSA have therefore both benefited the United States; they provide the benefit of being able to track almost anyone but the cost in terms of lost trust and damaged relations with the rest of the world.
