The issue of when a child is mature enough to consent to various decisions is a complicated one and this debate focusses on just one part; those decisions that relate to their medical well-being. There are a number of areas where the consent of parents is required – surgery, transplants, blood transfusion and others where the child is not able to give consent because they are too young; circumcision being one obvious example. Many jurisdictions stress that the child should be involved wherever possible but, the decision lies with the parents, or in their absence, a court.

Put simply, the doctor is free to use their medical judgement in an emergency situation – an arrival in an emergency room or accident and emergency department but where there is time available to ask for consent it must be sought from both the young person and their parents.

For example the General Medical Council in the UK sets out;

22. You can provide medical treatment to a child or young person with their consent if they are competent, or with the consent of a parent or the court. 4 You can provide emergency treatment without consent to save the life of, or prevent serious deterioration in the health of, a child or young person.

23. You should involve children and young people as much as possible in decisions about their care, even when they are not able to make decisions on their own. [i]

In many case, parents are happy to take the advice of doctors for their children, just as they would for themselves. However, and this is the focus of this debate, there are occasions where there is a conflict between the values or beliefs of the parent(s) and the general consensus of medical opinion. The contention of some doctors is that it is unfair for the parents to make a decision, that could cost the child her life, and that she may not have taken that decision later in life.

This is further complicated by the fact that many children, especially younger children, share the views of their parents, somewhat uncritically. Therefore, the doctor and the courts face the question of whether the doctor is able to overrule the opinions of both, let us say, a teenager and their parents. This debate will focus on the issue of blood transfusion for teenage children of parents who are members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses (JWs).

In 1945, a ‘blood ban’ was introduced and, since 1961, the willing acceptance of transfused blood by an unrepentant member of the faith has been grounds for expulsion from the religion [ii] . Clearly the issue here, for the believer is one of conscience. Their refusal of blood relates to the group’s interpretation of Acts 15: 28, 29 [iii] .

Set against that is the medical reality that a blood transfusion may be vital for several life-saving procedures and are an important part of many surgeries. The use of blood transfusions dates from the early-nineteenth century but only came into widespread use is the 1930s (Soviet Union) and 1940 (US and then other nations) so the position of JWs has been relatively consistent since the inception of the technology – although recent changes have continued to reject full blood transfusion but have accepted plasma products [iv] .

The issue of whether the rejection of transfused blood is in and of itself sensible is irrelevant both legally and in this debate.. Nobody disputes that the lack of medical action is a risk in medical terms – and one that may lead to death. The issue for debate is whether the religious views of the parents or the medical opinion of the doctors should have primacy in determining the correct course of action. The debate is about who should have the right to decide, not what that decision should be. This is considered as an issue of conscience, the implications for the soul of the patient are not considered here.

Although this debate relates to blood transfusion and JWs – we will assume that proposition have defined it as such – it’s principles would apply to other, similar, disputes such as whether parents have the right to reject organs from a person of another race or reject drugs that have been tested on animals.
