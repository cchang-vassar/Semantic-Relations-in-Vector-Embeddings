The free market is a system for allocating goods within a society. In a free market, prices for goods and services are determined only by the interchange of supply and demand. The means of production are privately owned, not government owned or controlled, and supply and demand match up through the interactions of private individuals, not through central planning or political decree.

For the purposes of this casefile, we assume ‘free market’ means an absence of every form of government intervention or regulation (‘laissez faire’), except the protection of private property and enforcement of contracts if freely entered upon. Alternatives to the free market are the ‘command economy’, in which the means of production are in government hands and supply to consumer demand is centrally planned, and the ‘mixed economy’, in which free markets coexist with regulated markets, wherein the government provides rules and regulations for the market to abide by.

Because the free market is a system for allocating goods and services, any type of debate where redistribution of goods is discussed, is likely to involve some of the arguments developed here. Examples range from a debate about privatizing or nationalizing utility companies, like water or gas companies, to a debate about legalizing the sale of one’s own organs. This casefile tries to give the most abstract and general arguments so as to be relevant for every type of debate, and provides illustrations from widely different areas.
