In many countries around the world individuals are free to choose to vote or not to vote, while in other countries (Australia, a couple cantons in Switzerland, Belgium and Singapore , for example) it is compulsory for citizens to vote. Punishment for non-voting can vary from a $15 fine to the possible deprivation of government services or the freezing of one's bank account. Is this a violation of an individual’s freedom of choice? With the citizens of many countries fighting for their right to vote, is it right that US voting turnout hovers around 50 – 60%of registered voters 1? Should voting be seen as a duty or a right? This debate explores whether compulsory voting improves voter participation, increases voter awareness on key political issues, and reduces the powers of special interest groups.
