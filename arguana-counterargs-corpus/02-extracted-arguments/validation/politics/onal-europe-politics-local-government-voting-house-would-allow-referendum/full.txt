# THESIS
This House would allow a referendum on Catalan independence


# INTRO
This debate is not a cost benefit analysis of whether Catalonia should remain within Spain as Catalonia despite how much many Catalans may wish for a vote on independence has yet to get that far. Instead for the moment the much more urgent question is whether the Catalans should get their vote on independence at all; the Catalans clearly say yes while the Spanish government and the other regions are firmly against. Once the issue of whether a referendum should be had is resolved and accepted by both sides, or the issue become less relevant by proposals of unilateral Catalan moves towards independence then this debate may become irrelevant and one about the costs and benefits of full independence much more necessary.

Although the pros and cons of independence are not particularly relevant to this debate the historical context for why the Catalans should want to have independence and why the Spanish state should be so against the prospect that, unlike the UK with its own secession problems over Scotland, 1 it is unwilling to allow a referendum on the issue may be of interest.

In the early part of the 15 th Century what is now Spain was still divided politically, Catalonia was a part of the Kingdom of Aragon rather than the Kingdom of Castile. In 1479 the territories of the two kingdoms were united in a personal union through the marriage of the King of Aragon Ferdinand II and Queen of Castile Isabella. Their grandson Charles I (usually known as Charles V outside Spain as a result of being Holy Roman Emperor) became the King of both territories in 1516. However each region within the Kingdoms maintained considerable autonomy; for example taxes had to be sought through each regions cortes rather than nationally and the Catalans in particular were often unwilling to pay for what they saw as Castile’s empire.

During the War of Spanish Succession Catalonia first recognised Philip V and then turned to the other claimant Archduke Charles when he entered Catalonia. Philip however won the war and kept the entirety of peninsular Spain in the Treaty of Utrecht on 1713. Having been on the losing side Catalonia had its constitution and independent political structure abolished, and its culture and language suppressed.

Catalan nationalism like other national identities was a result of the Renaixença of Catalan culture and literature during the 19 th century however this was simply devoted to greater self government within Spain rather than independence leading to the creation of the Commonwealth of Catalonia on 6 th April 1914 with the first devolution of powers back to the region of Catalonia from the Spanish state. 2 During the last days of the Spanish civil war Lluís Companys the Catalan President actually declared independence but there was never any opportunity to implement it. General Franco who won the Spanish Civil war in 1939 destroyed Catalan autonomy centralising Spain and suppressing dissent.

This suppression helped fuel resentment against a centralised Spanish government creating democratic movements against the dictatorship. Catalonia’s role in the end of the Franco regime and the return to democracy created for several decades a belief that the Spanish state would allow greater autonomy so allowing a Catalan nation within Spain. 3 However in 2000 the Popular Party won a landslide and began attempts to centralise Spain along with encouraging boycotts against catalan products such as cava. While the Popular Party lost power in 2004 they were still able to force the modification of a Catalan Statute of Autonomy in the Spanish parliament and then even after the modified statute passed they challenged it in the constitutional court. 4

The result of the court’s decision that the statute required further modification combined with the current economic crisis has led to a spike in support for independence. On 11 th September 1.5million people turned out for a Catalan independence rally in Barcelona showing the level of support for independence. 5

# PRO01A-POINT
Catalans clearly want self determination

Every peoples has the right to self determination. This is enshrined in the UN Charter right at the start in Article 1 as a purpose of the United Nations “To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples” and is also in other major international agreements. 1 Large numbers of states have been recognised since this principle of self determination was recognised by the world in 1945 a great many of them states that are less natural states in terms of size, economy, ethnicity or geography so it would be wrong to deny a right exercised by so many others from the Catalans. It is clear that the Catalans wish to exercise this right to decide their own destiny democratically through a referendum. When polled by the Catalan Survey Institute 74.1% said they would be in favour of organising a referendum with 19.9% against, the remaining 6% were undecided. 2

# PRO01B-COUNTER
It is far from clear whether self determination gives peoples the right to decide whether they should be independent. The Supreme Court of Canada has looked at this issue with reference to Quebec that has in the past argued for its right to self determination. The court argues “The recognized sources of international law establish that the right to self-determination of a people is normally fulfilled through internal self-determination -- a people's pursuit of its political, economic, social and cultural development within the framework of an existing state. A right to external self-determination (which in this case potentially takes the form of the assertion of a right to unilateral secession) arises in only the most extreme of cases and, even then, under carefully defined circumstances.” This is because such a right must fit in with the principle of territorial integrity of existing states. 1

# PRO02A-POINT
Control over Catalan destiny would reduce tensions and may help prevent independence

For Spain by far the biggest reason for allowing a referendum is that it may well be the best way of keeping Catalonia within Spain over the long term. So long as Spain says it will not allow a referendum or give the Catalans control over their own destiny the movement for Catalan independence is likely to get stronger as it can focus on the denial of democratic rights – Spain is waving a red flag to the bull. Allow a referendum, particularly if it has to be accompanied by a long period of campaigning for reflection and Catalans will have to agonise whether it is in their own best interests, 1 decide whether they want to damage their economy by having large companies such as Planeta the world’s largest Spanish language publishing business pulling out, 2 sever extensive links with Spain, and risk their membership of the European Union which Spain would veto. 3 If Spain were to offer as an alternative a new constitutional settlement that solves many of the grievances the Catalans have at the moment they might find they really want to remain within Spain, 4 much as many scots would prefer devo-max.

# PRO02B-COUNTER
This would be a very risky course to take; currently there is 51% support for independence and that could as well go up as down when given the opportunity. With both the Spanish and Catalan economies in crisis it is likely that such a referendum would only be bolstered by anger at the government due to the state of the economy. This might therefore be an option for Spain at some point in the future when the economy is back on its feet and so less of an issue but at the moment it would be waving goodbye to Spain as we know it.

# PRO03A-POINT
Catalonia will hold its own referendum regardless of Spain’s position

Catalonia is likely to go its own way and decide it should make its own decisions regardless of the rest of Spain’s views. Artur Mas Catalonia’s President says "If we can go ahead with a referendum because the government authorises it, it's better. If not, we should do it anyway". 1 So regardless of the Spanish position in his next four year term he will hold a referendum asking “Do you want Catalonia to become a new state within the European Union?” If Spain then does not back down about allowing this then there may well be a constitutional crisis. So far the Catalan option is simply to “internationalise the conflict we will have to go to Brussels to explain that they don't even let us consult with the people”. 2

Ultimately despite being within Spain so long as support for independence remains strong the Catalans probably have more cards to play; they provide more in taxes than they receive so could cut Madrid off, or in the final play they could unilaterally secede leaving Spain with the unpalatable option of either negotiating to get Catalonia back in, accepting, or invading.

# PRO03B-COUNTER
Such a decision by the Catalan government would clearly be against the Spanish Constitution and therefore illegal. The constitution makes it “the Army’s mission is to guarantee the sovereignty and independence of Spain, to defend its territorial integrity and the constitutional set up” so such a move would invite a military response. Some members of the ruling PP party have already stated that the Guardia Civil should take over the Mossos (Catalan police). 1 There are also members of the army who would be willing to take such action, "Catalan independence? Over my dead body and that of many soldiers" says Colonel Francisco Aleman who also compared the crisis to the start of the Spanish Civil war in 1936. 2

# PRO04A-POINT
If a referendum is not allowed violence may be the result

The worst case scenario is one in which the Spanish government continues to deny the Catalan people the ability to decide for themselves democratically and peacefully then it is possible that eventually the result will be a change from a peaceful movement to a violent one. Some outside observers see parallels with the break up of Yugoslavia where the solution has to be further decentralisation and the center accepting a democratic route – in Yugoslavia failure to do so ultimately lead to several wars. 1 2 For the moment there are only the slightest of hints that things may get more radical if denied Pujol the General secretary of the governing Catalan party says "There will be no way to avoid it. If we don't deliver it someone else will. More radical parties. But in a negotiation… it's not the best thing to reveal what you are going to do next" so there is the possibility some factions of the independence movement turning to violence as Eta did in the Basque region if denied the democratic route. 3

# PRO04B-COUNTER
Not getting your way in a democracy is not an excuse for turning to violence. Catalonia instead must attempt to persuade the other regions of Spain to allow a referendum or if it can’t then accept that the majority in Spain do not want Catalonian independence and respect their position. Violence will not help persuade the rest of Spain of its case; it did not for the Basques, and will not for Catalonia. So far the Catalan independence movement has recognised this with Lopez Tena the leader of the Catalan Solidarity for Independence party states “We would under no condition follow that [violent] path. That’s not how things are done in a democratic country.” 1

# CON01A-POINT
Spain is one indivisible nation

The Spanish constitution does not allow the holding of referendums on independence by Spanish regions. Spain is a single ‘demos’ made up of all the regions together rather than being separate and simply brought together under one banner. The Constitution says it “is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish Nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards”. 1

Moreover while referendums may be allowed for “political decisions of special importance” “The referendum shall be called by the King on the President of the Government's

proposal after previous authorization by the Congress.” 2 So the calling of one is first up to the national government to decide one is needed and then requires the approval of the national parliament. In case that was not clear enough it is reiterated in section 149 on the role of the State and Regions “The State shall have exclusive competence over the following matters: Authorization of popular consultations through the holding of referendums.” 3

3 Ibid, section 149

# CON01B-COUNTER
Section 2 of the constitution continues “it recognizes and guarantees the right to self-government of the nationalities and regions of which it is composed and the solidarity among them all.” 1 However it is not the constitution that is the problem blocking a referendum; rather it is the Spanish parliament. The government and parliament clearly could ask the King to allow a referendum on Catalan independence if it so wished. It should do so in order to prevent any more existential challenges to the constitution; constitutions have to be flexible if they are to survive the government is therefore wrong to treat it as a static unchanging document and justification for ruling out a referendum for Catalan independence. 2

# CON02A-POINT
Catalan independence would lead to further break up of the Spanish state

The issue of Catalan independence does not just affect Catalonia but the whole of Spain. All the regions of Spain have strong regional identities and Catalan is merely most widely spoken regional language with the both the Basque region and Galicia in particular having their own languages. Therefore a Catalan bid for independence might prompt other regions to make a bid for independence too. Moreover Catalan is spoken in regions outside Catalonia so these regions could potentially decide they are better off with Catalonia than Spain. 1

The basques in particular, who have already turned to the political path from that of violent separatism, are likely to take inspiration to work towards peaceful independence if the Catalans succeed and are allowed a referendum. 2 If Catalonia is allowed to secede then why should the Basque region be any different?

# CON02B-COUNTER
For the most part this is simply being alarmists. However if other Spanish regions do wish to go their own way then all the arguments for why Catalonia should be allowed its own choice apply to them as well.

# CON03A-POINT
The middle of a crisis is not the right time for divorce

Both Catalonia and Spain are in the middle of an economic crisis. Spain is considering a bail out by the European central bank and the prospect of losing 20% of its economy and the uncertainty while it happens would have an immense impact on the rest of the economy at a time when Spain already has unemployment of 23%. On the other side Catalonia’s regional government needs bailing out by Spain’s central government; it is seeking 5 billion Euros from a bailout fund set up by the Spanish government. Therefore while Catalonia may be the richest part of the Spanish economy but its government is missing its deficit targets. 1 It is therefore exactly the wrong time for Catalonia to be rocking the boat with a referendum on independence and the uncertainty this creates. Catalonia needs the Spanish government for its own bailout and the Spanish government needs stability if it is to avoid a bail out from the European Union and the conditions that are likely to come with such action.

# CON03B-COUNTER
It is not up to the Spanish state to choose when the Catalans should be able to have a referendum on independence. A time of crisis is as good as any; economic grievances are one of the main drivers in the desire for independence so it should come as no surprise that there is increase desire for a referendum when there is just such a crisis. Spain has already shown that it considers that there never has been and never will be a right time for a divorce. Even in the good times attempts to get an autonomy statute were met by challenges in the constitutional court which after years of deliberation watered down the agreement which had already been watered down by the Spanish Parliament. 1 More recently it was in large part the refusal of the Spanish Prime Minister to consider a request to consider Catalonia the same way as the Basques and Navarra in terms of finances that triggered the current crisis. 2
