Campaign Finance has always been a point of contention in American politics and the subject of a great deal of media attention every election cycle, because American political campaigns are particularly long and incredibly expensive. Money is needed to pay staff, buy media advertisement, and even raise more money. Presidential campaigns often cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Senate and congressional campaigns can cost several million dollars. In parliamentary democracies with smaller districts and shorter election cycles (or more irregular election cycles), the costs could be different and less significant.

Campaign finance reform (CFR) began in earnest in the post-Watergate era in the United States with the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act which created the Federal Election Commission (FEC), implemented disclosure requirements, donation limits, and federal financing of Presidential elections. The landmark Supreme Court decision of Buckley v. Valeo (1976) struck down the controversial provision of spending limits, as well as a provision of the law that limited the amount of personal money someone could spend on their own campaign. Eventually, this system of laws unraveled as the Supreme Court affirmed that political parties, labor unions, and political action committees(PACs) could spend unlimited amounts of “soft money” - spending not directly associated with a candidate’s campaign, such as broad issue advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and party building strategies. [1] PACs are types of organisations that campaign for or against candidates and are allowed to receive limited contributions from individuals but not from corporations and unions. [2]

However, in 2010 a landmark case came before the Supreme Court, Citizens United v FEC, which overturned a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act that prohibited corporations and labor unions from airing issue advocacy advertisements during the weeks immediately preceding an election. Furthermore, it overturned a prior Supreme Court decision that prohibited corporations and unions from engaging in direct advocacy – that is, advertisements that directly encourage citizens to vote for or against a candidate. Along with other related court decision, this decision is connected to the formation of Super PACs. Super PACs, in turn, are organizations that can receive unlimited individual, corporate, and labor union contributions to influence elections but may not co-ordinate with their chosen candidate’s campaign. [3] Total Super PACs spending on 2012 Elections reached $567,498,628 which invokes doubts over the integrity, corruption, and accountability of candidates to their constituency in comparison to their contributors. Super PACS are required by law to disclose the names of their donors and the amounts that people have donated. There have been other recent setbacks in bringing transparency to US politics, the DISCLOSE Act for example was blocked by the Republicans, but there has been legislation requiring on air identification of all advertisers. [4]

Bearing these events in mind, this debate will be looking at a campaign finance reform on whether corporations and individuals should be permitted to make unlimited contributions; whether corporations deserve the same political and/or speech rights as individuals; and whether those who engage in issuing advertisements should disclose their donors in the advertisements.
