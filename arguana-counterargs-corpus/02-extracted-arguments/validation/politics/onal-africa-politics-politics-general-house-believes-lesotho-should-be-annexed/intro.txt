Lesotho is a small country of just over 30,355 km2 (12,727 sq. mi) in size with a population slightly over two million which is landlocked and completely surrounded by South Africa, a much bigger country 40 times the size and 26 times its population. This unusual situation of a country having no access to the sea and being completely surrounded by another country is a result of South Africa and Lesotho’s colonial history.

Basutoland, as the current Lesotho was known was threatened from the 1830s by the Boers, originally Dutch colonists in South Africa though no longer under Dutch control, who claimed territory in the region. The British in charge of Cape Colony, the colony that would later go on to be South Africa, in response made a treaty with Basotho recognising them as an ally in 1843. While Anglo Basotho relations were briefly upset by a brief war in 1854 they were soon brought back together after the Boers declared the Orange Free State. Hostilities broke out in 1865 with the Boers besieging Thaba Bosiu a mountain stronghold that acted as the capital. King Moshoeshoe appealed to the British who agreed to make the country a British protectorate. Unlike the rest of South Africa therefore the region was brought under British control by diplomatic agreement, not conflict or settlement. The territory was ruled from Cape Colony, but mismanagement resulted in a rebellion in 1880-1 and an appeal for direct rule from London which was accepted in 1884. [1] This has meant that Lesotho and South Africa despite both being controlled by the British were run separately. In turn this meant that when South Africa became a dominion in 1910 and was then granted equality between the dominions and Britain in 1931 Lesotho remained separate and under British, not South African control. When independence came in 1966 Lesotho therefore became an independent country.

Key terms:

Annexation (Latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous). Usually, it is implied that the territory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size. The model of how the annexation is going to take place is not necessarily relevant to the debate but both parts can agree it will happen after a sovereign referendum by the people of Lesotho. Moreover, this debate will settle if the annexation is in favor of both countries and their population.

Mosotho is the demonym when referring to a single person from Lesotho while when talking about more than one person the word used is Basotho.
