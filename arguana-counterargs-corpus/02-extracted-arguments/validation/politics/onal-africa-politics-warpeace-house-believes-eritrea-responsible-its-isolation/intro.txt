Eritrea is a small nation state on the coast of the Red Sea with a history of past struggles. A former colony of Italy, its annexation by Ethiopia via the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 390 1 following the Second World War led to a thirty year armed struggle for independence. This movement allied itself with the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front and eventually gained independence once the combined forces overthrew Ethiopia’s Marxist government in 1991 2. Two years later it was finally recognised as a member of the United Nations (UN).

Despite initially positive relations, Eritrean-Ethiopian relations soon deteriorated over the Ethiopian occupation of Badme, which was traditionally Eritrean land as declared by the Boundaries Commision in 2002 3. Ethiopia claimed the land for itself and had occupied the town and other ‘Eritrean’ areas. Prior to this, the border had not been an issue for the unified forces as it was merely an arbitrary line between the two states. Eritrea eventually forced Ethiopian troops out of Badme, leading to the Eritrean-Ethiopian war. The 1998-2000 border war failed to completely resolve the issue. The war was symptomatic of decreasing international co-operation between Eritrea and the rest of the world. This debate examines whether Eritrea or other actors are responsible for the state’s isolation.
