The 1997 Ottawa Convention banned the use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines. [1] One hundred and thirty-three nations have signed the convention – the USA has not [2] although in 2009 the Obama Administration announced a review of US policy that might lead to it signing up to the Ottawa Convention. [3] The Convention's aims became official United Nations policy with General Assembly Resolution 53/77. [4] The Ottawa Convention requires those that do so to abandon the use of landmines within ten years, and also requires the destruction of the signatory's stockpile of landmines.

The main reason the US gives for its refusal to sign the Ottawa Convention is that it feels there should be a unique exception for the landmines in the Korean Demilitarized Zone to recognise the military necessity of preventing movement across that border.
