In October it was revealed that the United States’ National Security Agency had bugged German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s telephone calls and had been spying on her since 2002 [1] – long before she became chancellor in 2005. Although the suggestion was first reported in the newspaper Der Spiegel it was taken seriously enough that the BND, Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service, investigated and they too came to the conclusion that the German Chancellor had been bugged by the NSA. Merkel was not amused: “The federal chancellor spoke with President Obama today by telephone. She made it clear that, if the indications prove to be correct, she unequivocally disapproves of such practices, and considers them totally unacceptable. Among friends and partners, like the Federal Republic of Germany and the US have been for decades, such surveillance of communication of heads of government should not take place. This would be a grave breach of trust. Such practices must immediately be put to a stop.” [2]

Merkel is not the only world leader that has been spied upon by the NSA; the agency spied on at least 35 leaders. [3] However she is the most prominent, as well as being an americophile and the head of a country that is a prominent US ally; it might be expected that the US would be attempting to bug the phone of a rival’s leader such as Putin’s but not a close ally.

Despite the statements of outrage as the spying was revealed Merkel would prefer to resolve the situation quietly through diplomacy but there has been little progress in talks and it may not be entirely here decision to make. The German Federal Prosecutor, Harald Range, says that he has sufficient evidence to launch an investigation into the surveillance of the Chancellor’s phone. Whether there is a prosecution is mostly up to the prosecutor; the Justice Minister can block an investigation but it is very rare, and in this case would be controversial. [4]
