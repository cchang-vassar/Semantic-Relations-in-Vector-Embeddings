Tactical nuclear weapons are nuclear weapons designed for use on the battlefield and in other military situations. As opposed to the larger, strategic nuclear weapons, they are not meant for use against civilian population centers or to damage the ability of states to wage war. There are many kinds of tactical nuclear devices, including missiles, landmines, torpedoes, and artillery shells. These weapons have much smaller destructive capability than their large strategic nuclear weapon counterparts. Designed to destroy large troop formations and emplacements, tactical nuclear weapons are targeted weapons of war that leave fallout that does not leave the battlefield. The development of smaller and smaller such weapons has occupied the militaries of a number of states in recent years. The countries known to have deployable tactical nuclear weapons are the United States, Russia, China, Israel, France, India, and Pakistan. Supporters of such research argue that smaller nuclear weapons can find strategic application in situations where conventional weapons are ineffective. Detractors argue that development of smaller nuclear weapons will only encourage their use and create the risk of serious escalation. Proponents of tactical nuclear weapons argue that they are an efficient weapon for the battlefield that will not result in any escalation. Opponents on the other hand disagree fearful that their small size and lack of deterrence means they are both likely to be used and result in escalation.
