On the 30 th June 2012, Egypt welcomed its first democratically elected government and first elected President; Mohamed Morsi. Their election was the result of months of protest against the previous President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled over the country for the past thirty years. There was a great sense of optimism in both the domestic and international community for the first democratically elected president and parliament. It was expected that they would reverse the economic and democratic injustice which Egypt had suffered in recent years.

This was not to be the case, however. Several policies and actions taken by Morsi were poorly received by many in Egypt. When Mohamed Morsi announced in November 2012 that he was enacting a declaration which made him immune from judicial interference. This was perceived by many to be a return to dictatorship, which led to widespread protests. Both anti and pro Morsi supporters took to the street and the Egyptian army gave the President 48 hours to resolve the crisis. When Morsi failed to do so, he was ousted from power on the 3 rd July 2013. An interim government was put in place with the support of the army.

This action received a mixed response, some welcomed it stating that Morsi was undermining democratic institutions [1] . Others were less enthusiastic, however, pointing to Morsiâ€™s elected position and the authoritarian way in which the army acted.
