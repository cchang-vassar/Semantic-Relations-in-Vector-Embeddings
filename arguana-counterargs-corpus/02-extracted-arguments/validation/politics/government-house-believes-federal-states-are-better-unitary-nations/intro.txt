States are self-governing political entities with the monopoly of the use of legitimate force within a given geographic space. 1

A federal state is made up of constituent federal units (for example, the states of the United States of America) which agree to run some or all of their functions through a higher federal body with authority over those areas. This involves a formal agreement, often in the form of a constitution, which sets out the powers of the federal authority and constituent federal units. 2 Federal states can be contrasted with unitary states where the central government holds ultimate authority. They can have sub-state units like federal states, but these have autonomy on the whim of the central authority rather than guaranteed constitutional legal rights. 3

Nations are groups with strong cultural similarities through one or more factors such as common language, institutions, religion or historical experience. Nations with their own states are nation- states. A good example of a nation-state is Japan. Other states with multiple nations, such as the United Kingdom, are multinational states. 4

This debate is about whether nations should prefer to be members of federal states, where they enjoy some autonomy, or attempt to exist independently as nation states. Biafra attempted to secede from Nigeria between 1967 and 1970 in order to become an independent state for the Igbo people. This attempt was defeated by Nigeria, and Biafra was reabsorbed into Nigeria. 5
