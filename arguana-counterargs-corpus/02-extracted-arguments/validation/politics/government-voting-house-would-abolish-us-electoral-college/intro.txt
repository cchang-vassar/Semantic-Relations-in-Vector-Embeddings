The United States has perhaps the most arcane method of selecting its chief executive of any nation, one no country has chosen to emulate. There are a total of 538 votes in the electoral college, so a successful candidate needs 270 to win. Because all but two states cast their electoral votes as a unit, a candidate can win some states by narrow margins, lose others by large margins, and thus win the electoral vote while losing the popular vote. This last occurred in the election of George W. Bush in 2000.

The Founders had no political theory or coherent design in creating the electoral college, but they did have a number of motivations for doing so. Some were concerned about legislative intrigue and executive dependence on the legislature, so they wanted some mode for choosing the president other than legislative selection. Others worried about mob rule if the voters directly selected the president and feared the electoral legitimacy direct election would provide the executive. Still others felt voters would not know of distinguished men in other parts of the country, requiring intermediaries to identify the best candidates. Finally, the electoral college was a mechanism to protect slave interests, because slave states would receive credit for three-fifths of their slaves in the apportionment of electoral votes even though the slaves could not vote in an election. All of these intentions are now irrelevant in evaluating the electoral college.

There is no question that it violates core democratic principles, such as equality in voting. Are there compensations for this violation that justify maintaining it? Supporters of the electoral college argue that it protects small states, forces candidates to seek broad support, and helps to maintain the two-party system. Opponents respond that the electoral college ensures that candidates ignore most of the country, especially small states, in their campaigning, as they attend only to swing states; and that the system encourages third parties.

The electoral college has consistently proven to be unpopular with the public. Every Gallup poll taken on the subject has found clear majorities supporting direct election of the president. [1]

The existence of the electoral college is an arcane piece of electoral history but one with important consequences. As a result, it remains a hot button contemporary issue.
