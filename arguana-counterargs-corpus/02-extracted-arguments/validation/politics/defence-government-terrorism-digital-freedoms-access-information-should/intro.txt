Arguably, the main function of any government is to ensure the survival of the state and its citizens through economic, military, or political measures. That is why, in times of war, or imminent threat to national security, governments are legally entitled to adopt extraordinary measures, like restricting freedom of movement and communication, freezing of assets, or confiscation of property. Such measures are deemed necessary in a state of emergency to safeguard the safety of citizens, and are only meant to apply during the time of crisis. In recent years, the internet and access to digital media have proven to be powerful tools for political mobilization, and the organization of often-violent political protests. The clearest example of such mobilisation is the “Arab Spring”, where citizens through the Arab world, and Iran, used social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to mobilize and organize massive and violent protests that resulted in the overthrowing of several governments in the region. Given the proven potential of the Internet to facilitate the organization of such violence and disorder, should governments be given the prerogative to disrupt internet service when national security is threatened?
