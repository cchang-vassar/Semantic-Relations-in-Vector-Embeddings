The ICC is there to prosecute war crimes – there has been evidence of a war crime

The purpose of the ICC is to be the venue for the implementation of international criminal law, a principle that the international community has supported since the creation of the ICTY and ICTR and prior to that. [1] The crimes that the court is to prosecute include genocide – which is probably not occurring but has been alleged, [2] crimes against humanity and War Crimes [3] – which have certainly happened the chemical attacks being just one among many examples.

The allegations against the Assad regime are serious – including the use of chemical weapons, which are specifically mentioned as a war crime under article 8/1/b/xviii the Rome Statute. It would set a terrible precedent for such crimes to not be punished under international criminal law.
