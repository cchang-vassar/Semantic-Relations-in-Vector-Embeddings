On November 23rd, 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Committee passed a resolution condemning President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian government for the ongoing deadly crackdown on anti-government demonstrators in Syria [1] . Passing with a large majority of 122 to 14 (with 41 abstentions) [2] , the bill gained wide-reaching global support from Western and Arab nations alike. Arab nations voting for the resolution included Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt [3] . Turkey’s Prime Minister Mr. Erdogan has called for President Assad to step down [4] after accepting Syrian refugees to flee to his country and set up a base of operations for the opposition forces [5] .

The Syrian crisis began on March 16 th, 2011 when security forces broke up a gathering of 150 protestors in Marjeh Square in Damascus [6] . The United Nations estimates that the death toll in the Syrian protests now tops 9,000 [7] . Many people are calling for sanctions or more extreme measures to end the killing and restore peace and security to the people of Syria [8] .

The uprising in Syria can be seen as part of a much larger movement across the Middle East and North Africa known as the ‘Arab Spring’ [9] . People across this region have been rising up to protest against the undemocratic and ineffectual governments in power in their countries. Protesters have been met with oppression similar to that seen in Syria against the protestors. NATO intervened in a protest situation, by providing material and financial support along with air support for rebel fighters in Libya, who were fighting to unseat their dictator, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi [10] . The intervention has been largely considered successful in-so-far as the rebel forces, with the aid of NATO were able to kill Gaddafi and end his regime’s reign of institutionalized terror on the Libyan people [11] . However, as an on-going post-conflict situation with a power vacuum filled with violence and anarchy, there is large dispute over if the intervention was holistically beneficial or not for the Libyan people [12] .
