On New Year’s Day 2013 India launched one of the most ambitious anti-poverty programs in history. It marked a radical change from India’s previous anti-poverty policies which were charactarised by large subsidies on fuel, fertilizer and food. “The idea is to move to a completely electronic Cash Transfer System for the entire population” the subsidies will be abolished. The government will transfer up to 40,000 rupees ($720) per year for each household. The intention is that this immense change will just be in how money for poverty reduction is spent rather than affecting the total amount that is spent by the Indian state.

As the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh says “Direct cash transfers are now becoming possible through the innovative use of technology and the spread of modern banking across the country”. [1] The technology that is making this possible is Aadhaar a biometric identification system which every Indian is being signed up to. From this a cash transfer system will be used to electronically transfer benefits directly to the poor’s bank accounts, which they will now be able to open because they have id on the Aadhaar system.

As a radical change there will be close scrutiny of its progress and whether the change really does meet its goals of reducing corruption and eliminating poverty. Other countries will be considering whether to implement similar programs, will it provide a model to follow?
