Definitions vary, but a failed state is usually thought of as one where any government has broken down to the point where it can no longer provide certain essential services to the people. Most importantly, this often means that law and order has collapsed, with the government losing its monopoly over the legitimate use of force. In such cases, large areas of the country are in the control of non-government forces, perhaps through civil war but often as a result of lawlessness and banditry. Recent estimates by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace (see further reading) suggest that up to 2 billion people worldwide live in insecure states where the government has either failed or is fragile, and are exposed to varying degrees of violence as a result.

The most complete example of a failed state is perhaps Somalia, where no government has been able to take effective control of the country since the death of its dictator Siad Barre. Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cote D'Ivoire provide other commonly-discussed examples. States recovering from recent collapse could include Liberia, Sierra Leone and Angola, although in none of these is recovery certain, while Cambodia, Mozambique, Lebanon and East Timor provide examples of relative longer-term success after periods of failure. Today many observers are gloomy about the futures of countries including Zimbabwe, Nepal, Guinea, Afghanistan, Chad, Sudan, Bolivia and Iraq, as well as the Palestinian territories.

Proponents of preventative intervention argue it is necessary to prevent the suffering of civilians innocent of the decisions taken on the route to failure, and that allowing failure would risk regional instability. Opponents maintain, in contrast, that the cost of intervention is too high and that to provide a safety net to failing states would only encourage other struggling states to take risks.
