In 2009, the Ugandan government made international headlines when a private members bill was put forward which would have incurred the death penalty or life imprisonment for anyone proven to be homosexual. When Uganda passed the bill four years later, with the exception of the death penalty, it served to highlight the prevailing attitudes in many African states towards the issue of homosexuality.

As of 2013, 41 of Africa’s 54 recognised sovereign states outlaw homosexuality [1] . While the degrees of enforcement and severity for these laws do vary from state to state, the criminalisation of homosexuality has caused great controversy in the West. The majority of these states will not allow any form of same sex activity, even the possession of homosexual pornography can lead to a prison sentence. International criticism for the outlawing of same-sex relations has seen a notable increase since Ugandan Member of Parliament David Bahati proposed his private member’s bill. The Obama administration’s opposition to the international criminalisation of homosexuality and Britain’s proposals to reduce aid have increased the severity of the issue for many Africans[1].
