NAFTA- North American Free Trade Agreement- was implemented in 1994 by Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The agreement eliminated tariffs and quantity restrictions for imports and exports between the three countries 1. Almost twenty years later, the success of NAFTA is hotly debated. While trade between the three countries has increased, particular industries in each nation have been hurt by shifts in production. The debate focuses largely on Mexico and the United States, where it is unclear whether the benefits of cheaper products have outweighed job replacement. In this debate, it is important to consider that there are many economic indicators that may claim to evaluate the success of NAFTA- income inequality, unemployment, GDP growth, trade deficits, etc. Furthermore, NAFTA does not exist in a bubble- North America has been heavily influenced by social changes, technological advances, cross-continental relations, and many other factors which may influence the economy. Therefore, debaters should hesitate to assume particular changes are the direct result of NAFTA.
