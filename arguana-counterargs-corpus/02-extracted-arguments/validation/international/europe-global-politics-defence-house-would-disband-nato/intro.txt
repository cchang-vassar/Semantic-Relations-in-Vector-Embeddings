NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, is a military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty. It was founded in 1949 by twelve Allied countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and France, originally with the intention to provide collective security for Europe against the Soviet-led Communist bloc. In response, the Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955, a rival collective security organisation led by the Soviet Union.

When the Soviet Union collapsed, the Warsaw Pact disintegrated, but NATO continued existing. In fact, in 1999 and 2004, it expanded with many new members who originally were a member of that same rival Warsaw Pact, including Poland (1999) and the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 2004).

Through membership of NATO, all member countries commit themselves to ‘mutual defense’. This means that all member states commit to assist another member when it comes under attack. Formally, this assistance isn’t necessarily military, but in practice it is assumed it means military assistance. This idea of ‘an attack against one is an attack against all’ under NATO was invoked only once, after the attacks of September 11, 2011 on the U.S.

The members of NATO hold regular military exercises together, with the aim to improve coordination and cooperation between their respective militaries. NATO also issues so-called STANAGs (STANdardized Agreements) which harmonize rules, procedures and equipment of the militaries of all members.

Next to that, NATO also runs the Membership Actions Plans (MAP). Countries can request to receive a MAP, which is a plan to put them on course to eventually joining NATO as a full member. Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro all have MAPs. Georgia has expressed interest for a MAP and Ukraine expressed interest until 2010.
