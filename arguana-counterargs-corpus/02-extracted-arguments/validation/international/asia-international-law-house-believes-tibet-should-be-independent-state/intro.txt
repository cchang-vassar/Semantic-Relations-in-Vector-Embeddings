Located high in the Himalayan Mountains, Tibet is one of the most isolated places in the world. Yet while it is geographically and culturally distinct, it has a long history of interaction with its neighbours. An aggressive series of Tibetan rulers built a large empire during the 9 th century AD, repeatedly invading China, and while Tibet submitted to the Mongols, it was never quite conquered.

Tibet managed to remain largely independent of both the various Chinese and Indian dynasties until 1724 when the Qing dynasty sent a resident commissioner. His power varied – from 1794 until the late 19 th century he wielded significant control over the court of the Dalai Llama, but the Llama remained nominally absolute, and Chinese influence collapsed prior to the 1911 revolution. [1]

Tibet’s autonomy came to an abrupt end in 1950 when Chinese troops invaded. For the next nine years the Dalai Llama ruled in uneasy cooperation with the Chinese government before fleeing to India in 1959. Since that time China has pursued an aggressive campaign of secularization and modernization which on one hand has resulted in a large rise in living standards and the abolition of feudalism, but on the other in repression of Tibetan culture and the forced importation of Han settlers.

There are two main aspects to the question of Tibet’s future. First there are questions of how China has governed Tibet. Has China failed to govern Tibet in an appropriate manner, or has it done a pretty good job? Has it violated human rights in Tibet? Was its exiling of the Dalai Lama inappropriate? Is it illegitimate for China to govern Tibet while depriving it of its spiritual and historical leader? Does this constitute a suppression of its religious freedoms? How bad are China's human rights violations in Tibet relative to human rights violations elsewhere in the world where separatist movements exist? Is it really all that bad or are we just being hyper-sensitive to Tibet due to the public exposure of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan case? Has China stonewalled Tibet on negotiations, or has it been politically reconciliatory? Has China economically exploited Tibet or helped invest in and modernize it economy? Conversely, have Tibetans followed ethical and human rights norms in Tibet, or have they engaged in the same kind of abuses as the Chinese government? Have Tibetans killed and/or abused Chinese settlers in Tibet? Have Tibetan protests been peaceful and respectful, or have they been unethical and/or violent? Has the behavior of Tibetan exiles been appropriate, or have they been violent and revolutionary? Should a Tibetan right to self-determination survive any alleged Tibetan human rights abuses? Does Tibet have a history of human right abuses? What effect does this have on Tibet's bid for independence?

Secondly there are the more moral questions of legitimacy. Namely, whether the Chinese seizure of Tibet was legitimate, and whether that should have any bearing on the present.

Finally there are the questions of whether Tibet would be a viable independent state. Would it be able to resist Chinese influence? Would it only be able to do so with excessive Western aid? Would the latter justify Chinese fears about dismemberment? What would happen to the Han settlers who make up almost half the population?
