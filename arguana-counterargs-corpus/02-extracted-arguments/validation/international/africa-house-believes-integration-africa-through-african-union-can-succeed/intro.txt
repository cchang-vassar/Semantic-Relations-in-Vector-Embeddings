In July 2002, the fifty-three members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) disbanded that organization and inaugurated the African Union (AU). The goal of the AU is to create an international organization similar to the European Union. The OAU itself says its objectives are “to rid the continent of the remaining vestiges of colonization and apartheid; to promote unity and solidarity among African States; to coordinate and intensify cooperation for development; to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States and to promote international cooperation within the framework of the United Nations.” [1] It is to have a central bank, to be fully functioning by 2028, and a shared currency. Already there is a Pan-African parliament, an African Court of Justice and an African "peace and security council" has been created. [2]

The AU is, in part, the brainchild of Libya’s now deposed Muammar Qaddafi who withdrew Libya from the Arab League. Qaddafi regularly called for a United States of Africa, possibly with him as its first President. He had also suggested a unified African gold dinar as a currency with the intention that it would be based on gold rather than the US dollar. Qaddafi’s downfall does not leave the idea entirely without support as other states such as Eritrea, Ghana, Senegal and Zimbabwe has shown interest. [3] Despite Qaddafi leaving the scene the idea of a “united and integrated” Africa has not been abandoned, although it is likely the original timescale of it being done by 2025 will likely have to be extended.
