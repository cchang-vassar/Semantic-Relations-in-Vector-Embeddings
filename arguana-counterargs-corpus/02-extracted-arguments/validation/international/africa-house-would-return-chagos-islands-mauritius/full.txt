# THESIS
This House would return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius


# INTRO
The Chagos Islands are an archipelago of 55 islands with a total land area of just 60km 2 of which the largest, Diego Garcia makes up 44km 2. The islands are a part of the British Indian Ocean Territory which is located south of India approximately half way between Africa and Indonesia. [1] The islands are therefore a part of the legacy of colonialism as one of few territories still controlled by the UK.

Although the Chagos Islands are not considered ‘Non-Self-Governing Territories’ by the United Nations special committee on decolonisation [2] the sovereignty of the islands is disputed, and the inhabitants desire a form of self-determination.

The sovereignty dispute over the Chagos islands is with Mauritius. The Chagos islands were ‘discovered’ by the Portuguese in the 16 th Century but were first claimed by the French along with the islands that now make up Mauritius. These were ceded to the UK in 1814/15 at the end of the Napoleonic wars. [3]

Chagos might have become part of Mauritius when that country was given independence in 1968 but in the years prior to independence the UK engaged in wheeling and dealing to ensure that did not happen. The UK changed the administrative boundaries and paid off any complaint from Mauritius with £3million. [4] Mauritius despite this attempt at buying them off have consistently disputed the amputation of the islands. [5] The UK has said that it will cede the islands to Mauritius when they are no longer needed for defence. [6]

The people of Chagos are the reason why the islands are not a normal case for decolonization as they have been expelled from their home islands. 2,000 islanders were expelled between 1968 and 1973 so that the US military base of Diego Garcia could be built. [7] There are now believed to be 4-5,000 Chagossians, mostly living as citizens of Mauritius although some were given British citizenship in 2002. The Chagossians have demanded a right to return to the islands and have taken the UK to court. In 2000 the British High Court ruled that the islanders should be allowed to return to the outer Chagos Islands. The Government however contested this in the run up to the Iraq war. [8] After victories by the Chagossians in lower courts the Law Lords decided by 3 to 2 in favour of the government in 2008. This was followed in 2012 by the European Court of Human Rights ruling it did not have jurisdiction as the UK government had already given compensation. [9] The main hope of the islanders now rests on the Permanent Court of Arbitration where Mauritius is contesting the UK government’s decision to turn the islands and surrounding ocean into a Marine Protected Area.

There is likely to be a decision either way at some point in 2014. The agreement between the US and UK for a lease of Diego Garcia expires in 2016 and the deadline to extend or modify it is December 2014. Mauritius is determined that “The objective of 2014 is to reassert sovereignty.” [10]

# PRO01A-POINT
Mauritius is far closer

The UK should not be controlling territory that is almost 5786 miles away from London. The Chagos Islands should be under the sovereignty of an Indian Ocean country like Mauritius that is much better placed to look after the interests of the islands. The age when countries had the right to control territory half a world away on the basis of might makes right are long gone. The Chagos islands, as with other remnants of colonialism, should be handed over to the nearest state with a good claim. In this case Mauritius.

# PRO01B-COUNTER
If distance is anything to go by then the Chagos Islands should be a part of the Maldives which the islands are 600 miles closer to than they are to Mauritius. [1] Moreover the Maldives are on the same geographical feature as the Chagos islands; the Chagos-Maldives-Laccadive Ridge. [2] The irregularities of the borders of colonial administration should not determine who rules offshore islands.

[1] Both distances taken from google search.

[2] Whitmarsh, Robert B., ‘Some aspects of plate tectonics in the Arabian Sea’, deepseadrilling.org, p.527, http://www.deepseadrilling.org/23/volume/dsdp23_14.pdf Incidentally this would potentially matter if the Chagos islands were uninhabited as the Maldives might have a claim due to territorial contiguity

# PRO02A-POINT
Uti Possidetis

The borders of states that gain independence are set by the administrative boundaries that the colony had prior to independence. This prevents any gaps in sovereignty, or any attempt by the coloniser to keep a chunk of the territory, and the conflict this would inevitably bring. General Assembly Resolution 1514 made this clear “Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” [1] This also means that Mauritius should have control of the Chagos Islands which were, up until 1965, a part of Mauritius.

[1] United Nations General Assembly, ‘Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples’, un.org, resolution 1514 (XV), 14 December 1960, https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/declaration.shtml

# PRO02B-COUNTER
This was meant to prevent colonies being carved up into irregular pieces not to allow a new colonial master over a territory almost 1400 miles away from the main country as the Chagos Islands are from Mauritius. The reasoning for setting administrative borders at the beginning of the 18th century cannot have any rational bearing on who the islands belong to when those borders are not either clear physical or ethnic boundaries. The borders of Mauritius changed regularly; they originally included the Seychelles until 1903 when they were made a new colony. Two more islands were transferred in 1908 and 1921. [1] Which was the real colonial border?

# PRO03A-POINT
Self determination

The most important principle of the international system since the end of the Second World War has been self determination; the right of nations or peoples to "freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development". [1] The UK has staunchly defended the right of self determination in other cases such as the Falkland Islands about which the Foreign Secretary, William Hague has stated “We have always been clear that we believe in the rights of the Falklands people to determine their own futures and to decide on the path they wish to take. It is only right that, in the twenty-first century, these rights are respected.” [2] The UK has also said it will accept the result of a referendum in Scotland. If areas that are far more important to the UK are allowed their self determination so should the Chagossians.

# PRO03B-COUNTER
The islanders do wish the right to self-determination but that does not have to mean they wish the return to Mauritius. Self-determination would mean a referendum in which the islands might chose to remain British, or possibly become independent. [1] It would not mean simply being handed to Mauritius with no regard to the people’s views.

# PRO04A-POINT
A human rights black hole

The Chagos Islands have been excluded from almost every human rights treaty from the Geneva conventions (III/IV), the Convention against Torture, through to the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Resulting in what Peter Sand calls “a kind of human rights black hole” which has enabled rendition flights to pass through the base. This is possible because the British government claims they have no permanent inhabitants. Sand suggests “the fiction of the “unpopulated archipelago”, staunchly defended by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office [FCO], will inevitably come back to haunt its authors in the very near future”. [1] With the islands being ‘uninhabited’ they are not entitled to an Exclusive Economic Zone under the UN Law of the Sea. Britain’s claim to the islands as a whole is also made more tenuous.

# PRO04B-COUNTER
With the exception of the far greater human rights abuse of the expulsion of the islanders there have been few actual abuses on the Chagos Islands. Mauritius however itself does not have a clean record. The U.S. State Department notes there have been arbitrary arrests, particularly of the opposition parties with the leader of the Militant Socialist Movement having been arrested and interrogated as a result of naming the government a “paedophile government” for not suspending a teacher accused of raping a student. “Other reported human rights problems included official corruption, violence and discrimination against women, abuse and sexual exploitation of children, discrimination and abuse based on sexual orientation, discrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS, restrictions on labor rights, antiunion discrimination, and child labor.” [1]

# CON01A-POINT
National interests

It is in British and US national interests that Diego Garcia and the Chagos islands stay under UK control with the UK continuing to allow a US base on the islands. Diego Garcia is clearly strategically located as a base in the middle of the Indian ocean a base that may be useful for action in any direction. The military base has a significant runway, satellite tracking facilities, and is one of only five control bases for the GPS. It has been used in every US military operation in the Middle East since 1973. [1] The island is therefore a necessary base for combatting terrorism and maintaining a US presence in the region. The UK has said that it will keep the islands until it is no longer needed for defence, with the Middle East as unstable as it ever has been now is not the time to be giving up the islands.

[1] Salter, Mark B., and Mutlu, Can E., ‘Securitisation and Diego Garcia’, Review of International Studies, 2012, http://www.canmutlu.com/Publications_files/RIS.pdf , p.6

# CON01B-COUNTER
There is no national interest in the Chagos Islands or Diego Garcia. If there were true national interests then Diego Garcia would be a British base not a US one, handing such security over to the US clearly shows that the UK does not have sufficient national interests at stake to maintain a base on the islands themselves. Moreover if it is in the national interests of the United States to have a base there is little reason to assume that the US could not negotiate similar terms from the government of Mauritius as that of the UK to secure those interests.

# CON02A-POINT
Chagos islanders don’t all want to belong to Mauritius

Many of the people of the Chagos Islands don’t want to belong to Mauritius. They want the right to return to their homeland, but also that the Chagos Islands should remain British. Allen Vincatassin, a leader of the Diego Garcians in the UK, argues “We were second-class citizens in Mauritius and if they govern the islands, we will be second-class citizens in our own land… We are British Indian Ocean Territory citizens, which we are proud to be. We believe we are part of this country. In a normal situation the people would come first but it seems the state of Mauritius comes before the rights of our people.” [1] The islands when resettled could survive very well as a part of the UK just as other territories such as the British Virgin Islands do with administration done locally but sovereignty remaining with the UK.

[1] Morrison, Alex, ‘Chagos Islands’ future lies with UK’, theguardian.com, 25 January 2010, http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/25/chagos-islands-uk-mauritius

# CON02B-COUNTER
If there is concern with the Chagossians becoming ‘second class citizens’ then this can be addressed in negotiations to return the islands to Mauritius. The British have not in the past been willing to take the views of the islanders into account, there seems to be little reason why they now should just because the UK might now stand to benefit. Regardless a poll of all Chagossians might equally lead to the islands being handed over to Mauritius.

# CON03A-POINT
Marine protection

The UK government has turned the Chagos islands into a Marine Protected Area. This would cover 544,400km2 around the islands with a no take zone preventing any fishing in the zone. The MPA will protect 60-80,00km2 of reefs and eight endangered or critically endangered species. [1] As the biggest such protected area in the world this will be making a critical contribution to protecting global biodiversity. While the Chagos Island’s seas are almost pristine Mauritius has been overfished with the overfishing further damaging coral suffering from coral bleaching. [2] Mauritius has objected to the establishment of the MPA [3] clearly showing that they wish to engage in exploiting the resources of the islands rather than engaging in marine protection.

# CON03B-COUNTER
The establishment of the MPA is clearly an attempt to strengthen UK control over the islands. A State Department cable leaked by wikileaks states “He [Colin Roberts, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Director Overseas Territories] asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents.” [1]

Moreover the UK, or rather the US occupation, is not good for the environment either. The US base at Diego Garcia has accommodated nuclear-powered submarines opening the potential for radiation leaks as has happened before in Japanese ports. Similarly a large amount of air and sea traffic creates the possibility of oil spills; there have been at least four major spills at Diego Garcia, the one in 1991 involved 160,000 gallons being lost.
