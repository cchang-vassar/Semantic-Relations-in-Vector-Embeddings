The Chagos Islands are an archipelago of 55 islands with a total land area of just 60km 2 of which the largest, Diego Garcia makes up 44km 2. The islands are a part of the British Indian Ocean Territory which is located south of India approximately half way between Africa and Indonesia. [1] The islands are therefore a part of the legacy of colonialism as one of few territories still controlled by the UK.

Although the Chagos Islands are not considered ‘Non-Self-Governing Territories’ by the United Nations special committee on decolonisation [2] the sovereignty of the islands is disputed, and the inhabitants desire a form of self-determination.

The sovereignty dispute over the Chagos islands is with Mauritius. The Chagos islands were ‘discovered’ by the Portuguese in the 16 th Century but were first claimed by the French along with the islands that now make up Mauritius. These were ceded to the UK in 1814/15 at the end of the Napoleonic wars. [3]

Chagos might have become part of Mauritius when that country was given independence in 1968 but in the years prior to independence the UK engaged in wheeling and dealing to ensure that did not happen. The UK changed the administrative boundaries and paid off any complaint from Mauritius with £3million. [4] Mauritius despite this attempt at buying them off have consistently disputed the amputation of the islands. [5] The UK has said that it will cede the islands to Mauritius when they are no longer needed for defence. [6]

The people of Chagos are the reason why the islands are not a normal case for decolonization as they have been expelled from their home islands. 2,000 islanders were expelled between 1968 and 1973 so that the US military base of Diego Garcia could be built. [7] There are now believed to be 4-5,000 Chagossians, mostly living as citizens of Mauritius although some were given British citizenship in 2002. The Chagossians have demanded a right to return to the islands and have taken the UK to court. In 2000 the British High Court ruled that the islanders should be allowed to return to the outer Chagos Islands. The Government however contested this in the run up to the Iraq war. [8] After victories by the Chagossians in lower courts the Law Lords decided by 3 to 2 in favour of the government in 2008. This was followed in 2012 by the European Court of Human Rights ruling it did not have jurisdiction as the UK government had already given compensation. [9] The main hope of the islanders now rests on the Permanent Court of Arbitration where Mauritius is contesting the UK government’s decision to turn the islands and surrounding ocean into a Marine Protected Area.

There is likely to be a decision either way at some point in 2014. The agreement between the US and UK for a lease of Diego Garcia expires in 2016 and the deadline to extend or modify it is December 2014. Mauritius is determined that “The objective of 2014 is to reassert sovereignty.” [10]

[7] N.b I have found no explanation for why the Chagossians needed to be moved when a great many US bases are in built up areas; simple convenience so that disputes such as those over US bases on Okinawa can be avoided?
