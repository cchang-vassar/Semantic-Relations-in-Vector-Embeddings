The Palestinian Authority was created through the Oslo peace process of the early 1990s to provide self-government for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza. It relies for its financial existence on funding from a range of donors, most importantly the EU (which gave it around $300 million in 2005) and the USA. [1] Since its creation, the PNA has been dominated by the Fatah movement led by Yasser Arafat, who died in 2004 and subsequently Mahmoud Abbas. Widely criticised by many both inside and outside the area for its corruption and lack of control over armed militias, life for many ordinary Palestinians has remained wretched. Fatah’s leaders have declared it in favour of the peace process, against terrorism and in favour of co-existence with a Jewish Israeli state - although many in Israel have doubted both its willingness and its ability to make even its own supporters and their militias respect these commitments. Other Palestinian groups, particularly Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad, have continued to reject the peace process and have engaged in terrorism, including rocket attacks on and suicide bombings within Israel.

Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928 but is now influential (though repressed) in many other Arab countries. The Muslim Brothers rejected both western colonial dominance and secular nationalist Arab movements, calling for spiritual and political renewal based firmly upon the Koran. Following Israel’s victory in 1967, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin applied these principles in Gaza and built up a range of charities, providing welfare services and education, while also encouraging resistance to Israel. Hamas - the name comes from the initials in Arabic of the Islamic Resistance Movement, and also means “zeal” - was founded at the start of the first Intifada (uprising against Israel) in late 1987. Under its leadership, islamist radicals joined the nationalists of Arafat’s Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) in rebellion. Hamas’ charter was adopted in 1988 and calls for the destruction of Israel, declaring that all the land between the Jordan and the Mediterranean should be Muslim. The charter is strongly anti-Semitic in tone and also declares that “There is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad”. [2]

Since 1988, Hamas has continued to provide social services and strongly influence many aspects of life in Gaza, while rejecting the peace process and PLO/Fatah authority. Being against the Oslo accords, it did not participate in the 1996 Palestinian Authority elections. Hamas is listed as a terrorist organisation by both the USA and EU, and its suicide bombings and other attacks have killed hundreds of people, both in the occupied territories and in Israel proper. Israel killed Sheikh Yassin in an airstrike in 2004, and it has targeted and killed other Hamas leaders as part of its anti-terrorism campaign. [3] Since 2000 and the second Intifida, it has gained in authority and popularity as Fatah and the PA have become discredited, especially in the (more secular) West Bank where its influence was previously small. Starting with unions, education boards and professional bodies, it began to stand for elections and win a share of power, and this change in policy continued with success in Palestinian local elections in 2005. In elections on January 25th 2006 Hamas won 74 of the 132 seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament; its members were sworn in on 18th February 2006, there was briefly a coalition agreement between Hamas and Fatah through the Palestinian Unity agreements. [4]

The victory in elections of Hamas lead to a reaction from the major governments involved in the peace process; The European Union, United States and Russia that without a renunciation of violence aid would be cut off. Hamas refused so aid was cut off. [5] In June 2007 after sporadic conflict during 2006 and 2007 fighting broke out between Fatah and Hamas with a resulting collapse of Fatah control in Gaza leaving Hamas in control. Fatah was however able to retain control of the West Bank so the Palestinian territories were effectively split. [6]

This topic focuses how western countries, particularly the USA and European Union, should react to any organisation that will not renounce violence gaining power in Palestine; whether democratically or otherwise. Such an organisation would most likely be Hamas – and indeed there has been a new coalition agreement between Hamas and Fatah in February 2011. [7] However many of the points in this debate could equally apply to any other terrorist organisation that could get into government in Palestine. Many of the arguments could also be adapted to consider Israel’s reaction, as well as that of other countries and of international institutions such as the UN and the World Bank.
