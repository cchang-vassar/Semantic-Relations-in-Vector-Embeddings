What started as a simple protest in February 2011 gained momentum to be one of the most crucial revolutions that attracted the world’s attention. On 16 Feb 2011 in the Libyan city of Benghazi, 200 protesters came to the streets to show support of human rights activist Farthi Terbil detained by the government [1]. The move was despised by the leadership of Col. Gadhafi which proclaimed that the government was not and would never be apologetic on issues concerning the detention of people who were seen as enemies of the state.

After only three days, the peaceful demonstrations turned to chaos with protesters clashing with security forces leaving 24 civilians killed, this prompted similar demonstrations in various cities of the country.

On 6 th March, after losing government control in Misrata, Tobruk, Zawiya, Brega, Benghazi, and other significant population centres, Gaddafi launched a counteroffensive campaign to regain control [2].

The government used force to displace the protesters who were determined to end dictatorial leadership in the country, tanks were used to shell people and buildings, many were injured and others killed by these attacks raising fears of a massacre if Gaddafi was to regain control, particularly of the second city Benghazi, a move that sparked western involvement. Pressure from France, US, and the UK for intervention forced the security council to approve a resolution for protecting civilians. On 17 th March, a no fly zone was passed to prevent government air attacks on protesters but some Arab and key western governments notably Britain, France, and the U.S., took more aggressive measures in support of the rebels. These ranged from on-the-ground training to supplying arms, providing real-time tactical intelligence and a bombing campaign, until Tripoli fell in late August and Gaddafi was killed two months later[3].
