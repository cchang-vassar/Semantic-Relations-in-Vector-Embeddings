Crimea will on the 16 th have a referendum on whether the region should join Russia. It is almost certain that the people will ratify the decision of the Crimean Parliament that they want to be a region of Russia not Ukraine. Ukraine has maintained that such a referendum is illegal so the Crimea’s vote is likely to inflame rather than dampen the tensions between Russia and Ukraine that have been near the point of war since Russian soldiers occupied Crimea as part of a Crimean self-defence force. [1]

It is also clear that the broader international tensions will also remain. The G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and US) [2] has said “Any such referendum would have no legal effect… it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force… we would not recognize the outcome.” [3]

So is there any possible solution to the crisis. It is clear that Russia and the United States (acting as proxy for the Ukrainian government) are a long way apart on the issue. The United States wants Russia to pull back its military from Crimea, and also its influence including halting the referendum vote. Moreover it wants negotiations with the current Ukrainian government which Russia refuses to recognise. Russia rejects such terms with the foreign minister Lavrov stating “To be frank it raises many questions on our side … Everything was stated in terms of allegedly having a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and in terms of accepting the fait accompli”. [4] Russia says it has counter proposals that will comply with international law but has not given any clue as to what they might be. Assuming the Crimea is as far as Russia intends to go into Ukraine then the maximalist positions by the two sides might be said to be for the Russians; keep Crimea, Ukraine’s government replaced preferably with a pro-Russian government. While Ukraine’s position would be complete Russian withdrawal, and elections are held at the end of the year as planned.

So what would be the meeting point between such positions? Russia would likely be willing to take one or the other, neither of which the west or Ukraine are likely to consider a sufficient climbdown.

The question then is how to negotiate a situation where Russia gets what it wants but Ukraine maintains its territorial integrity. The Lord Owen, a former British Foreign Secretary, suggests leasing Crimea to Russia. Russia would negotiate a lease over not just Sevastopol as they have now but over the whole of Crimea. A lease would mean that the territory remains Ukrainian soil but Russia has complete or almost complete control over the administration of the region. It being a lease means that Ukraine would not simply be giving up the right to administer the peninsular but would be paid for it either through cash payments or through cheap oil and gas supplies from Russia.

Note: Lord Owen has now put a bit more of his thinking in an article in The Guardian .
