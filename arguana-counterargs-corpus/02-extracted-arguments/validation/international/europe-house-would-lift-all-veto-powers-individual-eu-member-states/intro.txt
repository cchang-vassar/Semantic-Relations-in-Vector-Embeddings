The European Union has been since its foundation been a hybrid between an intergovernmental organization (IGO) and supranational federation (SF). One of the most notable differences between these two establishments is in the ‘attitude’ towards their member states. While IGO honors members’ sovereignty, SF puts forward collective spirit (in terms of rule of majority). These are also best represented by preferred voting procedures – IGO uses unanimity requirement and SF the vote of majority (currently, EU exercises qualified majority voting – in areas such as education, environment and economic and monetary policy implementation [1] [2]).

The unanimity requirement (effectively a veto power) is set as a default voting procedure for the most important issues dealt with in the EU (these are, for instance, taxation, social security and social protection, foreign and common defence policy) [3]. However, its usage is being restricted in favor of qualified majority voting, with the Treaty of Lisbon introducing the most recent reductions. The opinions about the usefulness (or harmfulness) of the unanimity requirement greatly differ. Intergovernmentalists believe that the requirement is enormously important to preserve the sovereign nature of the culturally different members of the EU. On the other hand, Supranationalists argue that it is exactly because of these vast differences that the unanimity principle hinders the EU.

The movement away from the unanimity requirement (notable in the recent years – Treaty of Lisbon changed 68 cases of unanimity requirement to qualified majority voting; for instance legal immigration, Europol, energy security and emergency humanitarian aid to hot-spots around the globe, the EU budget [4]) might have suggested that it is supranationalists that are correct, but looking at the recent development in the EU-UK relationship it is safe to conclude that any further ‘federalization’ may well cause Great Britain’s to leave the EU. Worries that similar scenarios, where attempts for further federalization would cause greater exclusion of multiple other members (such as France, Ireland – which both rejected the constitution - or Hungary) are justified, and cast grave concerns over the theory that the current situation of the EU could be improved, and in the future prevented by closer federalization.

However, what is there left for the EU in its current state? It is indisputable that the Greek crisis, caused by lack of fiscal discipline and lack of institutional tools looking out for potential threats, very negatively affected the whole EU. Is this not a sufficient reason to state that, at least in the monetary union, where problems of one greatly impact all the others, the individual member states are not self-conscious enough to take up on such huge responsibility? In 2012, not a single Eurozone country met the Maastricht criteria (including stable exchange rate, inflation under 1.5%, 3% budget deficit, 60% state debt and low long-term interest rates / see source) [5] that very criteria deemed to judge nation’s ability to adopt Euro. Not sticking to the conditions of membership is now more of a norm than an exception, and allowing the vetoing of decisions attempting to enforce adherence to the rules – such as the Maastricht criteria – may well only worsen the situation.

With the complexity of the problem there are hardly any simple solutions to be found. Good or bad options no longer exist for it is inevitable that with every action taken, there will be repercussions to be dealt with. Understandably, the focus should be on the long-term prosperity which often causes short-term hardship, making it politically extremely unpopular. Thus the question arises – will the leaders find the will to look the beast right into the eyes, and take it by horns; Is getting rid of the unanimity requirement the only way to do it?
