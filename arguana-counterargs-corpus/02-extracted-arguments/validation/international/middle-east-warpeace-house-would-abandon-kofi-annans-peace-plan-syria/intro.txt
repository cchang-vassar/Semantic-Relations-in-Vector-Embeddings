In March 2012 Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, came up with a peace plan for Syria. It was endorsed by the western powers, and by both Russia and China who had previously prevented sanctions against Syria passing in the United Nations Security Council. Most importantly Syria itself accepted the plan on the 27 th March.

The Annan plan has six points in which Syrian authorities

(1) commit to work with the Envoy in an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people

(2) commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians and stabilise the country…

(3) ensure timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting…

(4) intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons…

(5) ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists…

(6) respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed. [1]

The plan also called for “an immediate end to all violence and human rights violations, secure humanitarian access, and facilitate a Syrian-led political transition to a democratic, plural political system, in which citizens are equal regardless of their affiliations or ethnicities or beliefs, including through commencing a comprehensive political dialogue between the Syrian Government and the whole spectrum of the Syrian opposition.”

However as the plan was negotiated with the Syrian government and not the opposition, which itself is very fragmented and not represented by an individual leader, it is not surprising that the opposition for the most part rejected the plan. [2] The opposition is unlikely ever to accept any plan that does not involve Syrian President Assad stepping down. [3]

Only a few days after the plan was agreed and supposed to have started Annan’s spokesman Ahmed Fawzi was demanding Assad “implement this plan immediately”, something which has still not happened.

The conflict has continued to escalate. There have been days of fighting in Damascus itself and on the 18 th July a bomb killed Syria’s Defence Minister General Daoud Rajha, Assad's brother-in-law Assef Shawkat and General Hassan Turkmani and wounded Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar and General Hisham Ikhtiyar, head of National Security.
