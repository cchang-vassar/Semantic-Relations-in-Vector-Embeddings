The European Constitution is an attempt to provide an overall restructuring of the current EU institutional layout in order to deal with important challenges such as continuing EU enlargement, the EU integration process and the increasing role the EU is expected to play in world affairs. The first proposition for a Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome on the 29th October 2004. It combines and extends the different treaties on which the EU is currently based and presents it as one document that needs to be ratified by all member states in order to take action.

The treaty document proposes a series of important reforms. These include combining the three pillars into which current EU policy is divided, and clarifying in more detail the role of the EU Parliament, Council and Commission, giving almost exclusive legislative initiative and executive power to the Commission. The Constitutional Treaty was ratified by national parliaments or referenda in eighteen EU member states, but has been rejected in referenda by two more. The ‘no’ votes need not have stopped the ratification process elsewhere, but a Constitutional Treaty cannot come into effect without the approval of all 27 EU states so in practice the proposed constitution was dead.

The situation with EU law has undergone a major change in 2009 when the Lisbon treaty came in action. The Lisbon treaty contains many of the changes the constitution attempted to introduce, for example: A politician chosen to be president of the European Council for two-and-a-half years; a new post - called High Representative - to give the EU more influence on the world stage and others. However there are also differences between the Constitution and the Lisbon treaty, which made the ratification of the treaty a fact. On an examination of the text of both documents, it seems that the substance of the Lisbon Treaty is largely similar to that of, the now defunct, the European Constitution in terms of the reforms it institutes. However, much of the symbolism of the Constitution has not been reproduced in the Lisbon Treaty. More significant perhaps, is the fact that the term “Constitution” appears nowhere in the text of the Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty possesses several distinct features which are highly indicative of the fact that it is not a formal constitution as such. In addition to its lack of symbolism, the Lisbon treaty was not designed to stand alone but rather, merely, to amend the existing treaties.

The current debate will examine whether the EU needs a true Constitution other than the Lisbon treaty from two aspects. It is both a practical debate (does the EU need a constitution?) and a more abstract debate (is the EU the kind of entity/organisation that should adopt a constitution?) The arguments for and against an EU constitution rest on complicated issues of law, sovereignty, political philosophy and the efficiency and effectiveness of the EU’s institutions and procedures.
