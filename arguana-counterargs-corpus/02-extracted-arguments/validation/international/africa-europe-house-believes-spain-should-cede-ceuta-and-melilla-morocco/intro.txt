Ceuta and Melilla are two cities in Northern Africa which have been under Spain’s jurisdiction for 500 years. Both cities are exclaves on the Mediterranean coastline and share a border with Morocco. They are the remnants of a once mighty Spanish empire which stretched from Morocco to the Philippines through much of South America.

Melilla was seized by a Spanish fleet led by Pedro Estopiñán in 1497 and, similar to its twin city, has remained under Spanish control since. Economically, the country trades heavily with Morocco for many of its goods and around 36,000 Moroccans work daily in Melilla 1. Ceuta was a Portuguese possession during the fifteenth century which became part of Spain when King Phillip II ascended to the Portuguese throne in 1580. Modern day Ceuta is a low tax zone and has a notably large port which the city depends upon for its income 2. Unlike Melilla it shares few links with Morocco, with little infrastructure running between the countries.

Neither of these cities were recognised as independent when Spain ended its colonial rule of Spanish Morocco. Due to its geographical position, Morocco has claimed that Ceuta and Melilla are part of its territory and should be relinquished by the Spanish, a claim which the Spanish deny. Spain’s position, while initially strong, has been weakened by the 2008 financial crisis and the decreasing importance of the state in international affairs. Morocco has used these circumstances to bring the issue to the fore-front. 3
