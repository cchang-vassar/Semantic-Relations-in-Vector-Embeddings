Fidel Castro and his Communist government came to power in Cuba in 1959, much to the horror of the American administration of the time. Cuba was supported throughout the Cold War by the Soviet Union and became a flashpoint for Cold War tensions, notably during the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis when Nikita Khrushchev sparked the most dangerous Cold War confrontation by attempting to place nuclear weapons on the island.

America has maintained near total sanctions on Cuba throughout the period since 1959, but before 1990 they were largely counteracted in their effects by the weight of support, trade and subsidy offered by the USSR, which amounted to $4-6 Billion dollars per year. [1] Since the collapse of the Soviet Bloc the withdrawal of these subsidies caused a 35% drop in GDP, which was partly reversed after late 1990s market reforms that focused on foreign investment and tourism, as well as allowing some self-employment but living conditions remain below 1989 levels. After 2000 some of these tentative reforms were rolled back, while Cuba began to benefit from its alliance with Venezuela, which gives it oil in exchange for doctors and teachers. Fidel Castro stepped down from formal power in 2006, handing over to his brother who has recently announced further liberalising economic reforms, while political control has been maintained. [2]

Nevertheless, the poverty of Cuba makes it much more vulnerable to the effects of sanctions than it was. The decreased threat of communism has led to a re-evaluation of the sanctions in the US but so far the wounds of the twentieth century, and the electoral significance of Florida, where most Cuban émigrés live, has steeled the resolve of the White House. Sanctions were in fact strengthened significantly in the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, although some food and medicines were still allowed through under the Bush administration. Announcements by the Obama administration in 2011 should make it easier for US citizens to travel to Cuba and to send remittances to relatives there, and have been much criticised by opposition politicians and some Cuban-American lobby groups.
