Since 1979 the European Parliament has been the only pan-European, directly elected body. [1] Its powers have increased with successive decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and amendments to the treaties that define the political life of the European Union (EU), the most recent being the 2007 Lisbon Treaty. [2] The on-going processes of enlargement and constitutional reform in the EU have prompted many to ask whether the European Parliament’s powers of legislative co-decision with the Council should be increased, and whether it should have wider-ranging powers over the Commission. Expanded parliamentary powers could include selecting the members of the Commission and its President, more powers to hold it to account, and even having the right to initiate legislation (currently only the Commission can do this).
