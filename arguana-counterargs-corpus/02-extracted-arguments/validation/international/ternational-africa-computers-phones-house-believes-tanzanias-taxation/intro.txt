Tax is vital for a state; it is needed in order to carry out any of the functions of a state from national defence to welfare. However there is often a perception that Africa largely survives on handouts with a less developed taxation system. Investigating future trajectories for African development has therefore begun to focus on how domestic resources can be mobilised - how can tax be collected and what is a sustainable taxation policy? Tanzania presents one innovative idea; taxing mobile phones. In June 2013 Tanzania’s TRA (Tax Revenue Authority) confirmed the implementation of a national SIM card tax. The tax policy will impose a 1,000 Tanzanian shilling tax on each subscribed SIM card. With the prevalence of Tanzania’s informal economy argued to represent a barrier, and the prevalence of mobile technology identified as a potential taxable asset, to what extent does the SIM card taxation provide a pioneering model to be followed by others?

Taxation in Tanzania has remained a source of conflict and tension over time. Following independence, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere focused on building a unified, national ideology. One method for building unity was taxation incentives centred on the concept of Ujamaa - such as the ‘Poll tax’. However, the implementation of tax policies has proved to be prone to violence, repressive, and created conflictual state-society relations [1] . Therefore considering the contentious history of taxation does the revised approach offer solutions? The model advocates a universal tax, for all, on a product which has become more accessible and a vital, modern day necessity. Similarities may be drawn to the socialist ideologies motivating Nyerere’s Ujamaa. The model is universalising an equal, tax payment. The model is currently gaining regional support, with Uganda and Kenya implementing similar taxation models.

Upon returning to the ideas, interests, and context, of the tax policy this debate explores the controversy surrounding the model. The financial reform is putting taxation on the policy agenda, however, is it targeting the right resources for poverty reduction, promoting good governance, and sustaining high growth rates? Decisions have recently been confirmed to reject the SIM card tax.
