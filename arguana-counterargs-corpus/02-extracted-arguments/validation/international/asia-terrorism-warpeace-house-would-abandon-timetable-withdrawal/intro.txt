In 2007 and 2008, violence in Afghanistan steadily increased and the country became less stable, leading to calls for an increased US and NATO troop presence in the country, or a "surge". In 2009, the Obama administration has increased troop levels from around 30,000 to over 60,000. In the late summer of 2009, the administration began considering, based on a request made by Afghanistan General Stanley McCrystal, adding additional troops, possibly increasing the total number to over 100,000 in 2010. In 2011 the U.S. and more than a dozen other nations announced drawdown plans to shrink the foreign military footprint in Afghanistan by 40,000 troops at the close of 2012, leaving Afghan forces increasingly on the frontlines of the decade-long war. The United States is pulling out the most â€“ 33,000 by the end of 2012. That's one-third of 101,000 American troops who were in Afghanistan in June, the peak of U.S. military presence in the war. This has prompted significant debates in many of the nations contributing troops to the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The main questions being considered are the following. Is the war in Afghanistan "necessary" for US national security? Is it key in preventing future terrorist attacks, similar to the September 11th attacks? Is a continued war effort necessary to achieve these goals and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a "safe haven" once again for Al Qaeda terrorists? Or, are targeted strikes on any budding terrorist cells, continued elevated border security, and heavy airport security and screening sufficient (without an increase in troops)? Do troop surges help improve security, or do they actually draw in insurgents and increasing violence, civilian casualties, and instability in the country? Does the US and NATO have a moral obligation to Afghanistan, and to helping it develop into a stable democracy? Or, is it justified to consider efforts in Afghanistan only in the context of counter-terrorism, and leave if such interests are secured, or deemed "securable" without troops on the ground? Does Afghanistan have a larger value to the US and NATO, or is its general strategic value relatively limited? Can continued large expenditures of blood and treasure be justified in Afghanistan? Or, in a world of finite resources, should the war be brought to an end sooner than later, whether the endeavour is considered a success or not?
