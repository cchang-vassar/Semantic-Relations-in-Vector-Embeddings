During the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Donald Trump proposed the idea of a wall that stretched the border of the US and Mexico. The purpose of the wall would be an attempt to primarily stop the flow of undocumented people and drugs. A wall between the border would be made of various types of fencing in some places and a stone wall in other depending on what the landscape allowed. Trump also stated his intention to have a large door in the wall. There are logistical problems to the wall as well as ethical ones, but what remains to be seen is whether or not a wall would be effective. Presently, there is fencing along some parts of the border that has been ineffective at stopping any enter or exit.
