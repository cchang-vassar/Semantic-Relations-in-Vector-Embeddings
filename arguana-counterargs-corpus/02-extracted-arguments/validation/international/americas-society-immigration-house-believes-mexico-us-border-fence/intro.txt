The United States Congress passed the "Secure Fence Act of 2006" which authorized the creation of several separation barriers at the Mexican-American border and the installation of a virtual fence consisting of surveillance cameras, sensors, and other equipment to cover those parts of the border that do not have a physical wall. The debate is highly related to the American debate on immigration, and controversies about the fence center on its efficacy, costs, symbolic value, and more.
