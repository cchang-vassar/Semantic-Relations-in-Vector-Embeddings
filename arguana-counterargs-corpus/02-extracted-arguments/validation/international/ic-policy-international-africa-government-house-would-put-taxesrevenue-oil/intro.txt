One of the biggest and most influential industries in the world is the oil business; oil companies are 7 of the world’s 20 biggest public companies and 7 of the top 10 by sales, [1] and these are not even the world’s biggest oil companies; state owned ones are bigger. [2] These companies are therefore clearly influential, they have a lot of money to spend and they can potentially transform the fortunes of a country if they decide to invest.

To make matters worse oil companies go where the oil is, which will often mean working in the poorest countries; those least able to exercise control over the industry. These are also countries for whom the striking of oil wealth can have a transformative effect. A small impoverished country can become (technically) wealthy overnight if there is a large strike of oil on their territory. There is immediately a problem of what to do with this wealth. The wealth is in the ground, a foreign company will need to dig it up and sell the oil passing money on to the country. Yet the country has no expertise to manage a bidding process and little leverage over the companies once they begin drilling beyond killing the golden goose.

Oil wealth does not automatically solve a country’s problems. Indeed there are many poor countries with large oil reserves an example of this is Equatorial Guinea which is considered a high income economy by the world bank yet also has 76.8% of the population in poverty. [3] This is because all the oil wealth goes into the hands of the country’s dictator Teodoro Obiang Nguema and his cronies. The question is how can such a situation be avoided? One suggestion has been that the money that comes from oil wealth – which may come directly from a state owned oil company or taxes on the production from private companies as a result of the oil being a state resource (the USA is the only country where the resources underground is entirely private) – should be put in an independent fund. This is what Norway does. [4] This fund would be out of reach of politicians and only give back a certain amount per year – such as just the profit from the investments.
