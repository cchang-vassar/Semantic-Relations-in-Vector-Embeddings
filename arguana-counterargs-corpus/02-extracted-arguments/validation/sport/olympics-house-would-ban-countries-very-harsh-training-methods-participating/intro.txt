With the Olympics fast approaching, we must ask, what is the price of gold? Professional athletes already sacrifice huge amounts in order to earn the ultimate prize, but some athletes endure untold hardships and abuse to get there. Particularly prevalent in gymnastics but present in other sports, athletes have been beaten, starved, physically and mentally abused and forced into unusually cruel and inhospitable environments in the name of ‘training’. These allegations tend to be directed towards Romania, China and Russia, although scandals have hit other countries. This house asks, should we allow this to go on? If not, is banning countries from participating if they do opt to subject their athletes to these methods the fairest or most successful means of tackling the issue?

If the policy were to come into place, it’d likely come from the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), who are the central body who currently rule upon international athletics. The policy would ban nations found guilty of using these techniques, indefinitely, until investigations are complete and evidence of reform is shown. That would be a definite change from the status quo where trainers are rarely exposed, and when they are, very little tends to happen. For example, despite the famous gymnastic coaches, Béla and Márta Károlyi, receiving multiple accusations of abuse, the couple are still prominent members of the gymnastics community and Marta Károlyi is the current USA team coordinator. [1] Under this rule, if the Karolyis were found guilty, the nation they coached would be banned from competing in the upcoming games and it’d be the responsibility of the nation to put in the necessary procedures to ensure abuses don’t happen again. The definition could go ‘hard-line’ and ban the entire country, including athletes who aren’t in the team where the abuses occurred, or could focus bans upon individual national teams. For example, if abuses were found in the Australian javelin team, you could either ban the javelin team from the Olympics, or the entire nation of Australia and all their teams. Let’s assume we’re going hardline.

The policy is drastic, but so are the scandals and allegations of abuse. So, how do we proceed?
