High-speed rail (HSR) is a type of passenger rail transport that operates significantly faster than the normal speed of rail traffic. Specific definitions by the European Union include 200 km/h (124 mph) for upgraded track and 250 km/h (155 mph) or faster for new track.

In Japan, Shinkansen lines run at speeds of up to 300 km/h (186 mph), and in China, high-speed conventional rail lines operate at top speeds of 350 km/h (217 mph), and one Maglev Line in Shanghai reaches speeds of 431 km/h (268 mph). As high-speed rail has become increasingly common around the world, and as countries begin considering whether adopting the transportation technology is a good idea, the debate over its various pros and cons has been elevated to newspaper front pages around the world. In the US, for example, President Obama's calls to institute a national high-speed rail system has been met with a flurry of both die-hard support and vitriolic criticism. The issues include whether high-speed trains are superior to flight and high-way driving, whether a better value can be achieved through expanding existing road, airport, and standard rail infrastructure and capacity, and whether high-speed trains are economical and a public good or merely a service that will be used by the wealthy. These and issues are outlined below.

This motion would have to be place set in the United States to make any real sense since investment in high speed rail is already occurring to a significant extent in Europe. By comparison in the U.S. $8 billion was taken away from the high speed rail program in November by congress. Proposition should ideally seek to propose this motion through re-implementing the $8 billion plan that Obama initially proposed. This would mean the creation of high speed rail services in ten different rail corridors as follows:

Southeast Corridor —Washington, Richmond , Newport News, Norfolk, Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, Columbia, Jacksonville

California Corridor —Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas

Pacific Northwest Corridor —Eugene, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver

South Central Corridor —Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Texarkana, and Little Rock

Gulf Coast Corridor —Houston, New Orleans, Mobile

Chicago Hub Network —Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland, Toledo, Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Kansas City, St. Louis, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis/St. Paul

Florida Corridor —Tampa, Orlando, Miami

Keystone Corridor —Pittsburgh, Philadelphia

Empire Corridor —Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Schenectady and Albany

Northern New England Corridor —Boston, Portland/Auburn, Montreal, Springfield, New Haven [23]

Whilst proposition does not have to go into so much detail regarding the lines, an example or two would be useful. Generally the debate can simply be framed with the idea that links between major American cities would be created by high speed rail.
