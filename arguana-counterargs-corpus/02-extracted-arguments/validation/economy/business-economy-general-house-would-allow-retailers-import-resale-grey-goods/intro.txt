"Grey" imports are goods which are intended for sale in one country or region by design of the manufacturer but which are available in an unintended country or region. While legal, they are considered on the fringes of ethical or socially acceptable custom because their sale is against the wishes of the manufacturer and/or official distributor. This debate focuses on the issue of whether retailers who do source product via the grey market are right to do so, whether the practice is beneficial, who it might be beneficial for and the moral, economic and social arguments for and against the practice. Generally market participants will buy from the grey market due to arbitrage (arbitrage is when someone buys low to sell high without adding anything extra to the product themselves.) In a grey market arbitrage someone buys low and sells high simply by moving the stock from region to region when that good is already officially available in the importing region. It is to be noted that grey imports are not counterfeits, copies or fakes. Another way of referring to a grey import is the terminology "parallel import." True figures for this area of enterprise are obviously hard to source, but one example from a study by KPMG in India shows grey market figures of "over 20% of the total colour televisions, 30% of GSM mobile devices, 90% of VCD and DVD players and 70% of car stereos." 1
