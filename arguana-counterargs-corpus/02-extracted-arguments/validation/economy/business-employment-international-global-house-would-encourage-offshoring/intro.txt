International trade has always depended, to some extent, on states seeking a competitive advantage over one another. A developed country may, for example, import raw materials from an underdeveloped country, process and refine them and export finished consumer goods. The developed state effectively sources a range of commodities from poorer states, taking advantage of the lower prices that result from poor states’ lack of bargaining power and unsophisticated domestic economies. Domestic markets in first world nations may prove to be a more expensive way to acquire commodities, due to the conditions imposed on industry by collective bargaining organisations such as unions, increasing scarcity of minerals

A more recent development of the ambivalent relationship between wealthier importers and poorer exporters has been the growth of the outsourcing market. Outsourcing involves companies and investors contracting business in third party states to perform services for their behalf, controlled via a client-service relationship rather than an employee-employer relationship. Assembly and manufacturing are commonly outsourced, alongside a range of back and front office functions, including payroll, customer-facing IT support and billing. While outsourcing has been a growth sector within many first world economies, rising educational standards, coupled with the widespread availability of sophisticated communications systems, mean that firms are now investing heavily in outsourcing services provided by businesses in developing states.

Weaker currencies and comparatively lower wages in states such as India and China attract significant interest from first world companies. Independent outsourcing is frequently correlated with a change in the hiring and expansion practices of first world businesses. In addition to outsourcing, many firms now hire directly within growing economies; they may open branch offices or regional or continental headquarters.

The popularity of outsourcing has become a politically sensitive issue. Some developed states have experimented with job protection schemes, altering labour laws to oblige companies to hire within the borders of their home state. Other countries have attempted to use financial incentives, including tax breaks and government supported training schemes, to incentivise businesses to hire more workers from domestic labour markets. During national elections, job protection issues can often become central to parties’ campaigns in swing constituencies – as demonstrated recently during republican representative Mike Turner’s 2008 battle to retain his seat in Ohio.
