Early in the summer of 2012, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed to ban the sale of sweetened beverages larger than 16 ounces. It was Mayor Bloomberg’s goal to fight the higher obesity rates of the city by making unhealthy portions less available. Mayor Bloomberg’s plan was not to ban the sale of soda, but to limit the sizes sold. The ban would affect food establishments that are monitored by the City Department of Health. Many representatives of the soda industry and concerned citizens have voiced their opposition to the ban, but it will not be decided by a legislative vote. The ban will simply need the approval of the Board of Health. The proposed ban is controversial because it infringes upon freedom of choice, it lacks the unanimous approval of New York City, and it could be seen as “demonizing” an industry that is not the sole cause of obesity. Mayor Bloomberg recognizes that carbohydrates from sugared drinks are not the sole cause of the “epidemic” of obesity within New York, but he believes the ban could be a step in the right direction. The ban’s purpose is exclusively to fight obesity, but many ask why Mayor Bloomberg is focusing on weight-loss when his proposed solution could harm industry.
