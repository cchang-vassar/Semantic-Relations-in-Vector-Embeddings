High speed rail never makes a profit

The UK already knows that it is difficult to make rail services pay their way, currently fares from passengers despite regular criticism of them being too high, only cover 65% of operating costs. [1] High speed rail is no different in this regard; most of China’s high speed lines make a loss [2] indeed the only lines to have made a profit are Tokyo-Osaka and Paris Lyon. [3]
