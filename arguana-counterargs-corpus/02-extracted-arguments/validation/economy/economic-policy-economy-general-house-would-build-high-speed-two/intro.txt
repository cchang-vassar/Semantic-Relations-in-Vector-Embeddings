In the middle of the 1990s the formerly nationalised British Rail was privatised. The resulting franchise system has regularly been criticised for increasing prices, delays and bad service, as well as for the amount of state money that still goes into the system. [1] One area where there has been undoubted success, although privatisation may have nothing to do with it, is in the increasing usage of the railways. The number of passenger journeys has doubled from 735million in 1994/5 to 1.5billion in 2012/3. [2] This huge increase has taken any excess capacity Britain’s rail system had and lead to increasing problems with overcrowding.

The answer from the coalition government has been ‘High Speed Two’ (HS2), with High Speed 1 having been the link to the Channel Tunnel from London. [3] The commitment to creating a high speed rail network was in their coalition agreement that outlined some of the policies the parties could agree on; in this case it was a merger of Liberal Democrat demands for a greener country and Conservative opposition to the expansion of Heathrow Airport.

At the end of December 2010 the government started consultations on the route from London to Birmingham and then breaking in two with one branch to Manchester and another to Leeds. The government gave the go ahead for the first phase of the network to Birmingham on 10 th January 2012. The intention is that this phase would be complete by 2026 and the second phase would finish construction a few years later in 2032 having been started slightly later. The price tag was set as being £32.7billion. [4]

Since its launch however things have not been going well for HS2, it has faced hostility from residents along the route, questions about whether it will deliver its touted benefits and whether it is the best route, judicial reviews and inflating costs. Just as seriously for a long term infrastructure project the opposition Labour party has been increasingly sceptical with the shadow chancellor Ed Balls at the Labour party conference declaring “under this government the high speed two project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50bn… Labour will not take this irresponsible approach… there will be no blank cheque from me as a Labour chancellor for this project or for any project.” [5] With Labour almost certain to be in power at some point before 2032 the government clearly needs some backing from the opposition if the business community is to buy in.

The government has also been slowly revising down the forecasted benefits of the high speed line; in its most recent report the benefits were lowered from £2.50 to £2.30 for every pound spent on the project, [6] and this comes only a few days after reports that there would be many places around the country that would actually lose out as a result of the new line. Many people are not even convinced by the revised benefits and argue the money could be better spent elsewhere, either upgrading the existing network or even on areas that have nothing to do with railways.
