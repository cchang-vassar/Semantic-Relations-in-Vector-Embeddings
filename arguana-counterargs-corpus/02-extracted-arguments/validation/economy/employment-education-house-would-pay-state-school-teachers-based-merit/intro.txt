Merit pay for state school teachers means rewarding teachers for better performance according to specific and measurable criteria. State schools are schools that the government provides (in the US and Canada known as ‘public schools’), as opposed to ‘private schools’, which are schools created and financed by the private sector/civil society.

Merit pay is a broad term that may encompass a number of alternatives to the traditional salary schedules used in most schools. For instance, teachers can be rewarded for individual performance and/or for the performance of their entire department/school. Teachers can also be paid fully based on merit, or have a fixed base salary on top of which financial rewards are added whenever performance exceeds the criteria. And, teachers might be rewarded for taking on additional duties or responsibilities. In this case, we assume that merit pay means that teachers will receive individual rewards for performance on top of a some base salary, but will try to keep the arguments as general as possible. If the arguments refer to another case definition, it will be noted and explained. We also assume that teacher performance is assessed based on student performance, specifically how much their students improve on specified, standardized tests.

Merit pay for teachers is currently a hot topic in the United States. For example, on March 24, 2011, Governor Rick Scott of Florida signed a bill to put this motion in effect. [1] The state of Denver introduced a merit-based pay programme into its school system in 2004, with teachers’ approval.
