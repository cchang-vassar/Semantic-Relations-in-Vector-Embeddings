Mobility remains a key factor for development - a means of enabling the development of economic markets at a local, national, and regional scale (WDR, 2009). The World Bank classifies Africa as a continent that remains largely ‘immobile’. Borders are identified as a key restriction in Africa. An interactive tool by the Guardian shows how Africa remains the least connected continent in terms of air travel (The Guardian, 2014). Further, when considering the global geography of airlines - a key part of globalisation - African cities and nations remain embedded in the past with expensive, lengthy, and infrequent, air transport. However new opportunities are arising and the number of airlines operating within Africa has risen.

Open Skies is a policy tool used to liberalise air travel. The EU-US transatlantic agreement can be used as an example. The EU-US Open Sky agreements treaty has two components. The first – in 2007, liberalised air travel on both sides, enabling any US and European airline to have open access to any airports within the EU and US. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic no longer hold the monopoly on who can fly between London and New York. The objectives of the first component of the treaty included changes for consumers and suppliers in the aviation industry: promoting freedom for aviation investors, enabling greater transatlantic integration, and a healthier aviation industry. Additionally the treaty was predicted to generate more airline passengers, jobs, and a rise in tourist numbers. The second component of the treaty – signed in 2010, set to remove restrictions and regulations on the foreign ownership of airlines.

The Open Sky agreement has been justified as being beneficial to passengers and airline companies, creating competitive prices, frequent travel options, and a reinvigorated market. Agreements are presented as a win-win situation. In Africa the closest policy to Open Skies is the Yamoussoukro Decision (1999), calling for fewer restrictions on cross-border travel and the liberalisation of intra-African air transport rather than protection of national carriers. The commitment was signed by 44 African nations, however implementation results are lagging.

However, the benefits identified remain largely political and economic. To what extent is a social and environmental perspective required to enable a more realistic picture? As suggestions are being made to implement and construct an Open Sky agreement across the African continent – to create a competitive aviation industry and improve integration – who will benefit and how sustainable are the proposals? This debate explores arguments for and against an Open Sky agreement both within the African continent and globally.
