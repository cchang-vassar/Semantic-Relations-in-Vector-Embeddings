Heathrow is London’s, and there the United Kingdom’s, main airport. It is the world’s fourth busiest airport and handles more international passengers than any other airport. [1] Since 1950, a couple of years after Heathrow first opened, the number of passengers passing through UK airports has increased a hundred fold. And numbers are forecast to continue increasing, doubling again to reach 480million by 2030 so airports are becoming congested. [2] There is then a clear need to expand the existing infrastructure or build anew. Unfortunately this is not a simple proposition, expanding existing airports inevitably encounters local opposition due to the added noise it would cause. Simply building new airports ad hoc to meet demand is also not possible due to the need for airlines to mostly use hub airports so any new airport would need to be very large and would be a very long term project.

Hub airports are where airlines converge their flights on large airports in order to use that airport as a transfer point to enable their passengers to get to their intended destination. A ‘hub’ airport essentially depends on two factors: 1) the ‘spokes’ of the hub, these are feeder airports that, lacking enough demand, do not keep open a large range of routes for efficiency reasons, instead sending passengers to the hubs to board onward flights, and 2) whether the ‘hub’ airport itself has the capacity to receive and manage the demand of its ‘spokes’, which is to say whether the ‘hub’ is big enough or not. Having an airport with a large capacity and a strategic situation, it is the case of London with regards to transatlantic exchanges, is the basis for having a ‘hub’.

The argument about expanding Heathrow, Britain’s main hub airport, and how to meet increasing demand if not expanding Heathrow, has been raging for several years with the government unwilling to come to a final decision. In the debate the airlines, British Airports Association, and business more generally, are pitted against local communities and environmentalists in disagreements over the necessity of more runways and the impact those expansions will have. The other side of the debate is less about whether expansion should occur at all but more over whether it should occur at Heathrow or in other locations as Gatwick, Stansted, or in the Thames Estuary as proposed by London’s Mayor Boris Johnson.
