In December 2015 the leaders of the world, and large numbers of negotiators, gathered in Paris for the 21 st Conference of the Parties. The Conference of the Parties (COP) brings together all the countries of the world once a year with a continuing mission to tackle climate change. COP21 is however potentially the most significant since COP15 in Copenhagen due to an agreement being within reach. Because it is an intergovernmental conference every decision needs to be agreed by every country and progress is slow. This also means there is a debate about how binding an agreement can be.

After the relative failure of COP15 the United Nations eventually found a framework that it could work with through the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). These are targets for emissions reductions or a reduction in emissions intensity (the amount of emissions in return for a given amount of GDP) which each nation voluntarily submits to the conference. [1] In other words each country decides for itself what a reasonable contribution to fighting climate change is. The intention is that these proposals from individual governments when all combined will be enough to limit the amount that the planets average global air temperature will rise when compared to preindustrial levels. A limit of 2 degrees Celsius (C) is the generally agreed target the COP is aiming for even if there is little scientific evidence of this being a particularly significant figure. [2]

The agreement that comes out of COP21 will be an international agreement and as such it will be binding. However it is expected that the binding bit will simply be the targets, something no country will object to as those targets have been decided by each individual government. It has been agreed beforehand that the agreement will not be a treaty. [3] And as such it will not bind countries to actually meet those targets, and there will be no mechanism to prevent non-compliance. [4] Whether countries do meet their targets or not is of immense importance to the world as a result of the predicted consequences of higher levels of increase; much more extreme weather, damage to ecosystems, and extinction of large numbers of species estimated to be likely to be around 24% of all earths spieces.
