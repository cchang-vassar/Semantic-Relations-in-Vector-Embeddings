The Seychelles are an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. It is one of the smallest countries in the world at only 455 km2, its population is also comparatively small at only 90,000. Many of the islands that make up the country are flat reefs, though not all – its highest point is 905m above sea level. [1] As with many other small island states around the world, particularly Maldives, Kiribati, and Tuvalu the whole country is under threat from climate change. Unlike Tuvalu and Kiribati the problem is not simply sea level rise meaning the whole country could end up underwater; unlike those island states the country does have some higher ground. Instead the problem is that the remaining land will become uninhabitable. There is some sea level rise, but the problem is as much about erosion as a result of more intense storms, and higher and stronger tides. 80 percent of the population lives on the coast but moving into the higher areas is not an option as the country would be left with few resources and almost no fresh water supply. [2]

So far no country has ceased to exist as a result of climate change. Yet it has become increasingly clear that climate change talks are not going to result in deep and fast enough cuts in emissions to prevent some sea level rise so the position of the small island states will increasingly become untenable as their islands become uninhabitable. The search is therefore on for solutions. The most obvious scenario is that these states will simple cease to exist and their people will become climate refugees. There have been some immense estimates that there could be 200 million climate refugees by 2050 – but even if this were to happen the vast majority would be internal refugees, and not members of a disappearing state. [3] Thus there may well be 20million refugees as a result of parts of Bangladesh being underwater but Bangladesh would still exist – those refugees would still have other areas of the country where they could go. [4] The citizens of the small island states would be in a different situation as the nation they are citizens of would no longer exist; instead they would probably have to be taken in by neighbours although this might prove problematic because the refugee convention does not cover victims of natural disasters. [5]

Traditionally the four elements of statehood are having a defined territory, a permanent population, an effective government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Climate change threatens to damage the defined territory to the point that the second is no longer possible. This in turn is likely to jeopardise an effective government. Only the last criterion is not initially under threat. [6] So how might a state maintain these criteria when its defined territory is disappearing? The proposal would be that the Seychelles should buy, or otherwise acquire, territory from another bigger state. This state would cede some, or all, sovereignty over this territory. The territory would probably be a similar size or possibly if less economically viable slightly bigger than the current territory. Ideally the ceded territory would be islands or coastal so that the current skills of the people of the Seychelles are still relevant. Given the small size of the state it is likely uninhabited land could be found. However any current inhabitants would be allowed to remain, with the possibility that their current state might maintain sovereignty over them.

N.B. The arguments here could be used for any small state that is going to no longer exist as a result of climate change.

Allowing the current natives to remain, and for the possibility of contiguous sovereignty by two states over the same territory, opens up a lot of questions that have not been sufficiently explored here. The alternative that they be expelled, citizenship, or essentially become migrants however would make any deal much less likely to be acceptable.
