This debate is not about whether it is right for human beings to farm and eat other animals - this is covered in the debates on animal rights and vegetarianism. Neither is it about zoos, which are also covered in their own debate. Rather this debate is about various other uses of animals for sport, pleasure, and entertainment. Note though that many of the proposition arguments will also apply to other animal rights debates, so be wary of allowing overlapping points to distract from the central issue.

A wide variety of examples from different cultures around the world might be brought into this debate: 'blood sports' such as fox and stag hunting, and fishing; forms of entertainment using performing animals, such as circuses; and sports in which animals perform for human enjoyment, such as horse racing and bull fighting. Views on these issues are often very culture-specific - e.g. some Spanish people may find it easy to accept bull fighting, or some British people may feel more sympathy with fox hunting - these practices can form part of a national culture. Nonetheless animal rights advocates find these to be the most indefensible ways that humans treat other animals.

The most ubiquitous example to be found almost everywhere in the world though is the use of circus animals (no longer in the UK though). [1] It is worth noting that with regards any debate involving the European Union, the rights of animals in Circuses are currently treated as a matter for individual member states and are seen as a distinct and different issue to the rights of animals in Zoos (which are covered by EU wide directives on minimum welfare standards). [2]

There are two parts to the proposition case: first, it is wrong in principle to exploit non-human animals in any way; secondly, there are many concrete examples of how animals are made to suffer in the context of sports and entertainment. This debate could be done, as it is here, as an overview of a whole range of uses of animals in sporting and entertainment contexts. Alternatively, one particular issue, such as hunting, circuses, or horse/dog racing, could be taken as the main focus.
