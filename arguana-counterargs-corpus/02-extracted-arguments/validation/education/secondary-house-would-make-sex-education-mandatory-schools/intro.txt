Sex education has been taught in schools in a range of countries around the world for nearly a century in various forms [1] it has become a fixture in schools in most Western countries. The specifics of the education program vary between countries, but they all generally deal with the basics of reproduction, physiological development, sexual health, practice, and safety. In recent decades many countries, such as Germany since 1992 and Sweden as far back as 1956, have made sex education a mandatory part of schooling, a policy that has been met with extensive criticism, particularly from religious groups. Their criticism is that sex education is permissive toward young people’s sexual relationships and thus morally corrosive.

Opposition also derives from an objection to an extension of the state’s involvement into the family and questions of sexuality. [2] In developing countries sex education schemes have developed in part at least to attempt to stem the HIV/AIDS epidemic,

Although some religious groups have opposed these developments. In western nations however

sex education is not always mandatory, in England and Wales for example parents can refuse to let their children take part in some although not in all lessons which provide information about sex and reproduction. [3] Proponents of mandatory sex education highlight the benefits it provides in delaying the age of first intercourse, preventing sexually transmitted disease and teenage pregnancy and in providing useful information for life regarding sexuality and sexual expression. Opponents contend that sex education encourage early sexual relationships and the risks which attend that and should be the purview of parents, and that forcing it to be provided in schools undermines trust in the education system and harms the individuals’ relationship with the state and society.
