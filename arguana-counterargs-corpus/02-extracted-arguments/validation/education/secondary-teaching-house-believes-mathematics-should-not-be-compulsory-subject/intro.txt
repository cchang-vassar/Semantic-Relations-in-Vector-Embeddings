All countries have mathematics as a key part of the curriculum for young children. Most education systems teach maths for quite a bit longer than that. In the UK, Mathematics is compulsory up to GCSE level (age 16) while in the USA it is often taught to the end of high school.

However, maths is a subject which people often complain about. It shows up in almost every collection of “most hated subjects.” [1] And also in more professional polling where 37% of adults admit to having hated maths at school. [2] Many criticisms are levelled at it, including being boring and not being useful.

Basic arithmetic is an essential life skill, which we use literally every day – prices, times etc. Any reasonable education system should include this. But it is not far-fetched to say that most children will have learnt this by about 15. [3] That being the case, imagine a proposal to stop all compulsory mathematics lessons after that age. Is this a good idea?
