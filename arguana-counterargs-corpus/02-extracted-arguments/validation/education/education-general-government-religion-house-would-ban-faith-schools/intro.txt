A faith school is a school that is run by a religious group, such as the Catholic church. In the UK and many other western liberal democracies, the status quo is that some state schools are allowed to be faith schools in exchange for a small financial contribution towards the running of the school by the religious group running the school. The religious group also has control over how many and which children it admits, including the freedom to ensure that the majority of its intake is of its faith. They must follow the national curriculum but there is a lot of scope for including their own values in the education they provide. In this debate, the proposition wishes to completely remove faith schools from the education system.
