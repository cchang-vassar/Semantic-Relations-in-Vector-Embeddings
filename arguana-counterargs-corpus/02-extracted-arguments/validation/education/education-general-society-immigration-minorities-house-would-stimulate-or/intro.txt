In 2008 Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Germany, surprisingly for a national leader visiting a country with a large number of Turkish migrants he declared assimilation a “crime against humanity” and argued that Turks in Germany should study in their mother tongue, the language of one’s parents which is usually that learned from birth in the home, in schools and universities.

Large immigrant groups can be found all over the world. The United States and Canada are particularly known as immigrant nations but immigrants go elsewhere as well and there are many countries that are net recipients of migrants such the European Union and it is not restricted to richer states, Oman and Malaysia were among countries with more immigrants than emigrants from 2008-12. [2] Examples relevant to this debate are Hispanics of Mexican origin that reside in the United States, the Turkish and Polish population that is currently living in Germany or Austria and also large Asian communities living in Canada.

The form of stimulating (or subsidizing) mother tongue education for large immigrant groups taken in this debate is allocating money from the national education budget to permit foreign parents that are part of such a group to build and implement school programs taught in their native language.

A different model of implementation would change the line of reason, the advantages and disadvantages of the motion and therefore the debate. Ideas will still be valid if they are the consequence of your proposed policy.

It is difficult to generalise about the situation of mother-tongue learning among immigrant groups. Some countries demand more integrated than others. In Europe migrants are often perceived as forming closed-circle societies with low and sometimes no interaction with people who are not immigrants, in the United States the opposite is the case and it is assumed a migrant will integrate. In reality almost all states are somewhere between the two poles. Parents that are the first and sometimes the second generation of immigrants understandably choose to talk to their children and within the family in their mother tongue. This phenomenon leads most of the times in children who are struggling to get education and achieve a better integration with the local people.
