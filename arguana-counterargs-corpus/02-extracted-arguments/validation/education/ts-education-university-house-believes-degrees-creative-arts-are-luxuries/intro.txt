The creative arts might be considered to include painting and sculpture but also drama, poetry and creative writing, dance, composition and music, and others. This debate will not focus on literature and other disciplines, such as History of Art, where the main role is to analyze the creative output of others. Instead the focus here is on those degrees that seek to train students to be practitioners of those disciplines rather than generalists with a focus on discussing them.

There are two possible approaches to this debate (in fact there are many but two are the most obvious). The first – and the one most clearly in the spirit of the motion – is that the creative arts add little to the economy directly and that if society is going to have universities, especially in those countries where they are funded through direct taxation, then students should be focusing on subjects that have a proven economic worth. Although the arts do contribute financially to an economy, it tends not to be in the way that, say, languages, engineering or economics do. There is another aspect here, which leads into the second interpretation, that graduates of creative arts departments rarely make their living in that field; the competition is simply too fierce.

That brings us on to Prop’s second choice for a definition, which is that if people really want to learn the creative arts then a university setting is not the right place to do so. Stage schools and fine art colleges are often separate from universities and, even then, some argue that if someone has real talent, they should just get on with it. There are countless examples of people who have excelled in the arts who have no formal training and learnt their craft ‘on the job’.

The specific focus on the creative arts also poses some problems for Proposition. If drama has to go, then why not philosophy – or for that matter large chunks of physics? Very few graduates pursue their subject professionally and those who do tend to simply teach it to the next generation replicating the situation. As a result, if Opposition accepts that, say, History has a place on the curriculum, because it is a useful way of training people’s minds, then why not train them as poets or ballerinas?

Opposition has some strong arguments on this front – the arts directly generate more revenue than, say, English Literature. Many graduates go on to do jobs that don’t require any degree at all, let alone their particular degree – so, once again, why focus on this particular collection of degrees. Opp’s strongest argument, however, is that society is about far more than cold economic data and that the arts add hugely to society in a way that is difficult to measure but would certainly be missed.

This then opens up two lines of attack. The first is that the university experience is, in and of itself, a net social benefit. Latterly, it also raises the issue that having members of a society with certain skills enriches it even if those graduates never use the skills they have acquired professionally in later life.

Debater’s Note:

This debate can be an interesting way of looking at what role higher education actually fulfills and what taxes are for in the relationship between economic benefit and the wider social health of a nation. A truly minimalist approach would only leave us with what are sometime called the old professions – medicine, law, engineering, teaching and academia. Traditionally there would have been another slot on that list for the priesthood. That niche is probably now taken by IT. However, it is all too easy for this debate to degenerate into an exchange about whether Arts or Science degrees are ‘harder’ by some objective standard. That’s really not the focus of this motion (and it’s rubbish as well) and, tempting though that particular intellectual cul-de-sac might be, it’s best avoided.

For the purposes of these notes it is assumed that society is making some collective expenditure on the provision of degrees. Although in some countries this may not be explicit as the students incur the costs of their degree either up front or at a subsequent date, there is still an opportunity cost in terms of work that person could have been doing if they were not engaged in their studies. In those countries where the full costs of a degree are borne upfront by the students’ parents, the proposition may like to point out that parents are rarely wild about the idea that their child wishes to study poetry or dance as they do not believe that the expenditure will ever be recouped in income.
