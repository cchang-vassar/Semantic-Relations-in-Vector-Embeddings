Nearly every country in the developed world provides both free primary and secondary education. Such education is generally uncontroversial and accepted as necessary by both liberals and conservatives. In the case of higher education however, there is disagreement concerning the state­financing of said institutions. In many states, students must pay fees to attend university, for which they may seek student loans or grants. Alternatively states may offer financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford to pay fees and in some university education is completely free and considered a citizen’s right to attend. Debates center on the issues of whether there is in fact a right to university education, and on whether states can feasibly afford to finance such education.

As a debate meant for a quick introduction for some of our programmes such as Debate in the Neighbourhood this debate is a shorter and simpler version of http://idebate.org/debatabase/debates/funding/house-believes-university-education-should-be-free please read it for more detailed argumentation.
