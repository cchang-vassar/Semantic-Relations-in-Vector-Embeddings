An Amnesty can be defined as ‘a general pardon, esp for offences against a government’. [1] In the case of illegal immigrants this would be for the offence of entering and remaining in a country illegally and would in most cases not apply to those who have committed other crimes so there is usually an emphasis that an amnesty would only be for those who are law abiding – except for being in the country illegally. Amnesties may be granted by the executive or the legislature for a country, in the case of a general amnesty for migrants this would probably need both and would likely be a highly controversial move in any country. Politics about illegal immigrants are likely to be more highly charged in countries that already have a lot of migrants (whether legal or illegal) which means that migration is considered an social and economic issue that affects much of the electorate.

Despite their potential for controversy amnesties for illegal immigrants are not uncommon. Poland granted an amnesty for illegal immigrants in 2011, [2] Newt Gingrich has made some kind of amnesty part of his campaign for the republican nomination for the Presidency in the United States [3] and it was also a campaign pledge in the in the UK general election by the Liberal Democrats in 2010. [4] While the UK has never granted a general amnesty and the United States has only had one in some countries they are quite common; France and Portugal have offered two each, Italy five and Spain six amnesties. [5]

The proposition in the debate would have to give some idea of what conditions they are attaching to the amnesty and whether there are any limitations on it. Often more there are proposals for more limited amnesties rather than a general amnesty in order to reduce the political backlash that could result from a more indiscriminate policy.
