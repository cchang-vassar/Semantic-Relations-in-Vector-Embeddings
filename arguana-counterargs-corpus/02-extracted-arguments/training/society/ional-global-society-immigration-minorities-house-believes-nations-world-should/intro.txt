Migration has greatly increased in recent years, bringing into question whether current legislation provides sufficient protections for migrants’ well-being, and at what cost. As some countries take in large numbers of immigrants, and others lose people who emigrate away, different states have very different interests in the migration debate, making it a difficult issue for the “nations of the world” to address. Countries that receive more immigrants than emigrants are referred to as net receiving countries, whereas, countries migrants sending more immigrants than the number they receive are called net source countries. In 1990 The United Nations signed The U.N. Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, [1] which entered into force in 2003. The Convention represents a comprehensive international treaty regarding the protection of migrant workers’ rights. Many nations have signed this convention, but all of them are source countries and so are not the countries where the main burden of increasing protections will fall. No Western migrant-receiving State has ratified the Convention, even though the majority of migrants live in Europe and North America. The number of migrants in Europe grew by 41% over the past two decades, and by 80% in America, [2] so these nations are key to deciding the level of economic and social protection migrants will receive. This means that there need to be other solutions to increasing the rights of migrants that these countries will be willing to accept. This leads to the question of whether certain areas of the convention are fundamental and there are certain areas that are less important to the protection of migrants.
