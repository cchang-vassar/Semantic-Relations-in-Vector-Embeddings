To describe the political progress of the Reproductive Health Bill through the parliament of the Philippines as tortuous would be an understatement. However, after a decade of wrangling and political manoeuvring, a bill making contraception and family planning advice available from government health centres, as well as effective medical treatment for women who have had abortions or miscarriages and a place for family planning classes on the national curriculum, has become law. [i]

In the ten years since it was initially proposed, the Catholic Church has used its considerable political muscle (80% of the population are Catholic) to make every possible argument against the measure. However, in the words of one of the bill’s supporters, “At the end of the day, those who opposed the Bill just ran out of arguments, because you can see the stark reality in the Philippines: women need to be given a choice about how they create and run their families.” [ii]

Even after the bill had completed its passage through parliament, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) remained defiant. Writing on the CBCP website, Father Melvin Castro, said that the government clearly wanted to destroy “the traditional Filipino values of family and life.”

Fr. Castro added, “This government has revealed its true face. It has never been for the welfare of families, women and children.” [iii]

Proponents of the bill source their inspiration from somewhat less theoretical sources, Ramon San Pascual, former Executive Director of the Philippines Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development said “You see the need for change every day staring you in the eyes: Poor, young urban girls carry their malnourished babies while the religious leaders pontificate on the evil of reproductive health education. [iv] ”

The Catholic Church carries huge political clout in the country and has threatened to encourage civil disobedience to continue its fight. It has already been challenged in the supreme court in a petition that said the bill “mocks the nation’s Filipino culture—noble and lofty in its values and holdings on life, motherhood and family.” [v] It seems unlikely that their efforts will be successful as a clear majority of public opinion support the legislation. [vi] However, it seems likely that the debate will continue at least for the remaining three years of Aquinos’s term of office.

Socrates B. Villegas, Archbishop of Lingayun-Dugupan, speaking for the Bishops’ Conference condemned the decision as corrupt, saying that the money spent on contraceptives could be better spent on healthcare and education for the poor, which would have a far greater effect on their quality of life [vii] . Bishop Socrates’ statement certainly implies that the church will return to this issue in future elections.

The National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) estimates one fourth of the population can be described as impoverished [viii] . Many believe that contraception, both directly and indirectly through allowing the greater employment and education of women, is the single largest element of alleviating poverty around the world [ix] . The Catholic Church argues that contraception is a sin and, in the words of Villegas, “As we your bishops have said in the past a contraceptive mentality is the mother of an abortion mentality”. The Act also allows for the treatment of those women who have had an abortion, nay involvement with abortion is a mortal sin and can result in excommunication [x] .

Debaters’ Note

Debates such as this are difficult as the two sides approach the issue with different standards of proof. In this case, were the proposition to rely upon standard Catholic teaching, there would be no room for debate at all and no need for them to extrapolate their arguments beyond demonstrating that contraception is condemned by the Church and, it is claimed, scripture. This distinction is made as the references to contraception in doctrine are explicit (§2370) whereas those from scripture must be inferred.

However, a debate that ran along the lines of “The doctrine of the church is inviolable and must be obeyed”, “No, it isn’t” would be far from satisfying and, ultimately, futile. As a result, these notes have touched on biblical and moral arguments but leave dogmatic assertion alone. There is certainly no doubt that this bill flies in the face of Catholic orthodoxy.

However, the argument put forward by the CBCP allows debaters more fertile territory and are also introduced here. However, the evidence is fairly overwhelming that giving women control over their reproductive cycles is a huge issue with regards to poverty reduction; it is however, debatable – in the literal meaning of the word - as to whether this bill will prove more efficacious in that regard than the other measures suggested by the Filipino Church.
