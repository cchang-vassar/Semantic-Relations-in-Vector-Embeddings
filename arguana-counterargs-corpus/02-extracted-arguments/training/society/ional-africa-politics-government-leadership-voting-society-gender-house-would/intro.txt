What would Africa look like if women rose to positions of power in politics? How would ‘African governance’ change if women were included within governing bodies? Should quotas for including women be drawn up, and legally set, for all African nations?

When discussing women in Africa we are reminded of the gender inequalities prevalent within all societies. In order to counter-act this increasingly countries worldwide have set quotas on including women in politics. Africa has been at the forefront of this trend. Senegal established its women in politics quota in 2010. The quota acts to ensure at least half of local and national candidates are women. National women’s movements played a key factor in prompting the new gender quota, and legal enshrinement of including women in politics. Through the quota system women’s political presence is rising. It is reported 11 out of the 36 houses of parliament where women represent 30% of the political body are based in Africa (The Economist, 2013). Despite such positive figures when considering what countries showcase the highest gender inequalities, African nations represent 10 out of the worst 21 (Global Gender Gap Report, 2011). The worst ranked included Chad, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria.

It therefore seems relevant to ask whether the countries in Africa that are lagging behind should follow the lead of the most progressive. What difference does it make to include quotas on women, and should quotas be encouraged across African nation-states? This debate returns to the role of women in politics in Africa – what it means, brings, and presents an opportunity to change. The focus questions whether countries, such as Senegal, are pioneering an innovative system that can change the lives of women and nations?
