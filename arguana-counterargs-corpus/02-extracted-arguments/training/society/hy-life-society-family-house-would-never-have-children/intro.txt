This debate is not about states limiting or banning people from having children. Nor is it about individuals who, for medical reasons, are unable to have babies. Instead, the house may be understood as people, couples or just women. The debate will therefore focus on pros and cons of individuals having children. Globally more and more families are choosing not to have children. In Canada in 2006, 17.1 percent of women aged 30 to 34 said “no,” as did 18.3 percent of men in the same category when asked whether they were planning to have children. In the U.S. National Center of Health Statistics reports that the number of American women of childbearing age who define themselves as “child-free” rose sharply in the past generation: 6.2 per cent of women in 2002 between the ages of 15 and 44 reported that they don’t expect to have children in their lifetime, up from 4.9 per cent in 1982. In the UK in 2004 almost 50% of married couples were living without children. Also, 58% of cohabiting couples were childless. It has becomes so worrying in many countries that many countries are introducing policies to encourage couples to have children (tax reductions, benefits, subsides). At the same time many developing countries are trying to reduce their population growth which results in discouraging having children. For example, China governmental one-child policy means that couples are fined for having more than one child.
