Crime rates and particularly the rates of violent and gun related crimes are rising in most rich countries. Targets for blame include higher drug use, higher inequality and greater availability of weapons. While left-wing politics tends to favor rehabilitation and structural improvement to combat crime, the right wing has traditionally seen criminality as a rational choice that can be combated by deterrence.

Zero tolerance policing aims to stop serious crime by clamping down on the minor crimes like graffiti that the practitioners believe lead to further crimes and using custodial sentences for first offences. It includes set responses to particular crimes by the police although the courts maintain some discretion. Zero tolerance policies impose a pre-determined punishment, which is imposed regardless of mitigating circumstances such as past history or individual culpability. Zero tolerance is not necessarily exclusive of urban regeneration, social investment or community policing. Its exponents, however, often rule them out because of their political philosophy.

For important figures in the argument for zero tolerance note Charles Murray (aide to Margaret Thatcher), Rudy Giuliani (mayor of New York) and Lee Kuan Yew (founder of modern Singapore).
