The world is changing. People are migrating from one place to another. Countries in Europe, particularly the EU members, are also affected by this trend. There are many voices that claim the massive migration of people is very natural and beneficial for the EU, especially after easing the migration policy and opening labor market for people from the EU and also for people coming from other continents. On the other hand, there are people who do not believe these voices and they say that migration brings more harm than benefits. We cannot solve this problem without looking at both sides and their arguments. Therefore this debate thesis is set to look carefully into the issue of immigration and its impacts on the EU as a whole. I bet you have your own opinion but do not be narrow minded, open your mind think critically and then make a statement. Is immigration good? Is immigration bad? We shall see.

The EU and the immigration:

Facts:

Of the EU's approximately 495 million people, 18.5 million are non-EU nationalsâ€”just under 3.8 percent of the total population.

Recent projections suggest a natural decrease in the EU population between 2010 and 2050. Assuming zero net immigration, the EU's population would decrease by 26 million by 2030 and by 50 million by 2050.

Barring immigration, by 2050, the working age population (15-64 years old) in the EU is forecast to decrease by 59 million, posing a major economic challenge.

The largest immigrant populations in the EU are from Turkey, Morocco, Albania and Algeria.
