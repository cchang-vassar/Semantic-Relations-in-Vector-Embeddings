Since the financial crisis of 2007-8 there have been warnings of generational conflict, or of a ‘lost generation’ of youth who are unable to find employment and whose job prospects, even if the economy picks up, are grim. [1] The young are the group that have been hardest hit by the on-going economic problems in Europe. Youth unemployment across the union is more than twice the rate of adult unemployment at 23.3% compared to 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2012. When young people do have jobs they are often temporary (for times more often the case than for adults) or part time (twice as likely). [2] Not surprisingly years into the economic crisis young people are severely disillusioned about their prospects. In a recent Gallup poll 65% of people in France and 66% in Italy said they were pessimistic about the future of young people in Europe and in all of the six countries involved in the survey by margins of at least 3 to 1 (more than 10 to one in Italy) there was a belief that young people will have less opportunity to have a secure job than their parents. [3]

This disillusionment does not just affect those who are less well educated; in France those who are highly educated are increasingly leaving the country believing there are better opportunities elsewhere. [4]

To make matters worse the current economic crisis is not the only challenge affecting younger generations; another comes from an aging population. In 1991 19.3% of the EU 27’s population were under 14 while 13.9% over 65, by 2011 this had changed to 15.6% under 14 and 17.5% over 65. [5] As a result those who are still working will end up paying for the pensions and healthcare for more elderly people. Many country’s welfare systems therefore face a crisis in the not too distant future.

While there are similar broad trends throughout Europe different countries face different problems. In the United Kingdom for example one of the biggest challenges that the young face is housing. Loans for first time buyers are typically more than 3 times their income, [6] so most can’t afford to buy a home while rents are also high. The result is that more than 3 million people aged 20-34 still live with their parents. [7]

This debate is not proposing specific solutions to the problems with Europe’s youth. Any such policy solution such as more spending on training, education, or else on activities and youth centres would require a separate debate to look at the specific policy being proposed. Instead this debate is simply looking at whether the youth should have more money spent on them in general terms. Since governments only have a limited pot of money that they can use spending more on the youth means taking more money from elsewhere. This may mean raising taxes but it should be remembered that in practice this means taking more money from the middle aged. The result is that this debate about whether there should be more redistribution from older generations to younger ones.
