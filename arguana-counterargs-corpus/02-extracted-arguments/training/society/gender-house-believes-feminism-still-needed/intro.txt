Feminism is relatively difficult to define, both because of the breadth of the movement, which includes a wide diversity of views and some vigorous internal debate, and because it is so frequently caricatured by its opponents. A fair description might be that it is a movement committed to the pursuit of equality, notably but not exclusively sexual equality. It is based on an analysis of inequality rooted in the social transformation of sex (the real, biological differences between men and women) into gender (the various ways in which men and women are perceived as having different abilities and social roles), and the ways in which gender is implicated in unequal power relationships between men and women in many areas of life.

Feminism assumes that such treatment is cultural and thus possible to change and not simply "the way the world is and must be". Feminism looks to a different culture as possible, and values moving towards that culture. It consists of activism, individually and in groups, to make personal and social change towards that more desirable culture. Important topics for feminist theory and politics include: the body, class and work, disability, the family, globalization, human rights, popular culture, race and racism, reproduction, science, the self, sex work, human trafficking, and sexuality.

For years women have fought for their rights. Once women gained rights in society (including the right to vote in 1928 via the representation of the People Act 1928, in America in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and in Australia in 1902) they were no longer willing to be treated as second class citizens in the home or in the work place. But almost a century later has this feminist movement achieved its end goal of complete equality, or are there still battles to be fought by the feminist movement?
