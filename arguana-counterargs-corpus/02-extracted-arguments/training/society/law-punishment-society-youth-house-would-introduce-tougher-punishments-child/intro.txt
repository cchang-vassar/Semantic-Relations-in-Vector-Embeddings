Many nations, including the UK and the US, created juvenile justice systems to punish juveniles in more lenient, rehabilitative ways. Therapy is often offered and sentences are shorter. However, both nations have begun to change their systems to focus more on retribution and deterrence, meaning juveniles are now punished harshly. This is because of the rising number of juvenile offenders, which suggest the failure of the current policies. However, an increase also means there is potential for overcrowding in juvenile detention. Is this change just, or undeserved?
