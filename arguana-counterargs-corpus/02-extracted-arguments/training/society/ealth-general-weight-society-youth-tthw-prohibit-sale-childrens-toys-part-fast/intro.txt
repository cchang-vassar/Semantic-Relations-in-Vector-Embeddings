McDonald’s ‘Happy Meal’ has been a staple of the fast food experience since it was first launched in 1979, and millions are sold throughout the world every day. The meal generally includes a portion of fries, a burger, a soft drink, and a surprise toy. While the Happy Meal is the best-known example of such a product, McDonald’s is by no means the only company to use it. Almost all major fast food chains offer some variation of it. Everything about the product was created and designed with children in mind, from the size of the portions to the packaging, which was initially illustrated with cartoons and comic strips by well-known children’s illustrators. The marketing for the product has also always been squarely aimed at children, with the toy inside being especially effective in making the meal appeal to kids. For many, the Happy Meal is their first introduction to fast food. Also, the toys are usually part of a themed set or collection, based around popular kids’ movies or cartoons, making kids eager to return in order to collect them all. However, with many western countries experiencing an alarming increase in child obesity, some find that the marketing of food with low nutritional value to children should be brought under control. San Francisco is the first major city in the United States, and the world, to ban restaurants from including toys with meals that do not meet specific nutritional standards: exceeding 600 calories, a certain level of sodium and fat, and a lack of fruit and vegetable content. The measure came into effect in December 2011.
