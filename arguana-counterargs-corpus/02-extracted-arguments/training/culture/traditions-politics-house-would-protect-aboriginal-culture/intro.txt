Modern nations such as Australia, Canada, and the United States have struggled in their efforts to establish a fair and stable relationship with aboriginal, or indigenous, groups. In the past three hundred years, the aforementioned governments have often abused these groups through unfair and broken treaties, reckless dissemination of disease, and often direct violence. Consequently, these groups make up a small portion of the population today and are often plagued by problems with substance abuse and poor quality of life. Governments also struggle to establish a fair level of jurisdiction over said groups; while these nation-states recognize that indigenous groups were forced to submit to the government's authority, they are not willing to let indigenous groups break any law they dislike. This debate centers on the question of whether governments should act to preserve indigenous culture; this protection can take the form of land reservations set aside for aboriginals. However, it can also include language programs or funding for the arts so that, despite heavy losses in numbers over the generations, the remainder of these indigenous groups is able to pass down their culture. Protection of indigenous culture may also include special legal exemption from particular laws that are contrary to indigenous traditions. While many argue that aboriginals are entitled to special treatment because of a blemished past, others argue that this past is not a valid reason for special cultural protection.
