Since the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo Supreme Court ruling, spending money has equated to the free expression of speech in modern elections [1] . If campaign expenditure reform is not one of the most hotly-debated issues of the 2012 election- it should be. It is becoming increasingly more evident that the mechanism and sources through which candidates raise election capital have enormous influence on their political speech.

In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in the Citizens United v. Federal Electoral Commission that statutes protecting the ability of individual contributors to fund political broadcasts legally extended to corporations, because campaign finance laws could not deny free speech rights based on the type of entity claiming such rights. [2]

Debate over who should be allowed to donate, and how much, was renewed in the wake of the controversial ruling, bringing us to today: where do the two major candidates stand on the issue of campaign finance reform?

This debate is an edited version of a debate that is part of the US Presidential Election Project and as such there are some differences from normal debatabase debates. The two sides are not necessarily for and against, the two sides may agree on a few areas – in this case that there is some need for reform, but are instead Obama and Romney’s positions so may not add up to a compelling case. As in other debatabase debates the counterpoints will be highlighting the flaws in the argument. The Points For are Barak Obama's position and Points Against Mitt Romney's.
