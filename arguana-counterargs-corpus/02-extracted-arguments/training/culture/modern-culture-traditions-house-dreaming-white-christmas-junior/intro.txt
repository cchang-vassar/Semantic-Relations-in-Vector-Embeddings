Many people's ideal Christmas day involves snowy weather. Christmas cards often feature snow- white landscapes, along with polar bears, penguins and other cuddly animals from arctic areas. Christmas decorations and displays often involve fake snow or snowflake designs. And the song, "I'm dreaming of a White Christmas", written by Irving Berlin in 1940 and sung by Bing Crosby sums up the Christmas spirit in music for many people.

This wish for a white Christmas is especially strong in parts of the world like Western Europe and much of the USA, where snow on December 25th is possible but actually quite unusual. In the UK there is a great deal of speculation in the media each year about the chances of snow on Christmas Day, and many bets are placed on the possibility. Of course, in other parts of the northern hemisphere they expect snow for several months of the year, and so it is not such a big deal. This case is most relevant to those places like the UK and much of the USA where a white Christmas cannot be taken for granted. However, it also has relevance in many other countries, including even sunny Australia.
