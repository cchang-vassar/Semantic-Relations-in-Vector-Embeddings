The outing of gay celebrities is a difficult debate based around the balancing of societal benefit from the act with the rights of individuals to retain their right to privacy over their sexual orientation. Many gay rights activists support the act with websites such as “Queer Attitude” [1] and “Famous and Gay” [2] publicizing openly gay people in the public sphere, and continue to push for further exposure. Counter to this, groups such as the Even the Gay, Lesbian and Allies Senate Staff Caucus in the United States remain fundamentally opposed to the outing of gay celebrities and politicians [3] . This debate exists in a situation where we ask the question not if it’s good for people to out themselves, but if we have the right to out individuals who have chosen not to already.
