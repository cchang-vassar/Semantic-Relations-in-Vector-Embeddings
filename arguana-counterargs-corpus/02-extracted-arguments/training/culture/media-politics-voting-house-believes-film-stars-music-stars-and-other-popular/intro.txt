Throughout the world, celebrities from the entertainment world have been getting involved with political campaigns. Some, like Reagan and Schwarzenegger in the US, crossed the divide and stood for (and gained) positions of political power, whilst others have been involved in the endorsement of candidates.

This debate is about that latter scenario: what happens when a political candidate is endorsed by celebrities, and should celebrities be allowed to lend their support in that way? (It is also important to note that, the debate below is not about prohibiting celebrities from conducting their own campaigns, e.g. Bono’s ‘Make Poverty History’.)

Key example:

Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign was littered with celebrity endorsement. His most notable supporter was Oprah Winfrey, who joined him on the campaign trail. Garthwaite and Moore [1] estimate her endorsement to have been worth just over 1 million votes for Obama. Obama also shared platforms with Leonardo di Caprio and Bruce Springsteen, amongst others [2] . Further, Obama gained support from musician will.i.am, who produced a video (Yes We Can). This is believed [3] to have helped the formation of a grassroots campaign in support of Obama, who consequently reaped the benefits of an increased voter turnout amongst hard-to-reach voters (primarily young and/or black voters).
