Rarely a day goes by that the media does not report an incident of violent crime such as Grievously Bodily Harm, muggings or murder. These are reported via broadcast, digital media (internet website or social site) and print and the reporting is often in excruciating detail. There are some states, particularly those who censor the media more generally who restrict reporting violent crime. North Korea for example only allows the reporting of ‘positive’ news, this would obviously mean that there would be no reports on violent crimes occurring in North Korea – although there may be reports on other countries in order to highlight the difference between North Korea and the rest of the world. [1] However North Korea is an extreme example where the state prevents all reporting. There are other examples where there are de-facto restrictions on reporting. For example in the New Zealand city of Gisborne the police in 2010 stopped telling the local newspaper about incidents of crime so that “people feel safer”, this does not prevent reporting of violent crime but restricts it and means it is not so likely to be prominent. [2] While there are few cases of bans on the reporting of the initial crime it is much more common for there to be restrictions on the reporting of crime once it reaches court, in the UK for example a judge can impose a ban on reporting until the proceedings of a case are over. [3]

Such a ban might potentially be very severe such as the North Korean one and prevent all reporting. Much more likely however would be simply restrictions on reporting, keeping the reporting to a brief statement of the facts in much the same way as occurs with restrictions on reporting court cases [4] and any appeal for information that has been given by the police and family of the victim. The restrictions could also be location based with local news providers free to report more on local crime than national news.
