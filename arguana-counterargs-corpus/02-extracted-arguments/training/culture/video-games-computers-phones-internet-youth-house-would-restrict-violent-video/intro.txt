In 1999, two students of Columbine High School, Colorado, shot and killed 13 fellow pupils and finally themselves. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold enjoyed the bloody video game Doom and, according to some, were inspired by it. In the wake of the attack, advocates argued for increased restrictions on the sale of particularly violent video games. Opponents maintained that any correlation between the students and their video game habits was purely incidental. Laws banning or restricting the sale of violent video games and enforcing rating upon them have been introduced by several US states (Washington, Indiana and St. Louis among them). In Europe, Germany has also moved towards a ban on violent video games after 16 people were killed when a 19 year-old opened fire in an Erfurt School in 2002. Rating systems, adopted globally by the video game industry in 1994, established the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), a comprehensive labelling system that rates over 1,000 games per year and has now rated more than 8,000 games in total. Less than 1 per cent of all games released in the UK have been rated as suitable only for people 18 years or over.

Proponents for a restriction on the sale of violent video games argue these figures are not sufficient, that there are more than 1% of video games on the market today that are too violent for young children to be playing and restrictions must be increased. Opponents argue however that there is no link between violent video games and violent behaviour and that restrictions would achieve little regardless, for kids would get hold of the games anyway.
