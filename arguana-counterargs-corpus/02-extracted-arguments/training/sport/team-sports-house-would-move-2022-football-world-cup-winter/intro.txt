Qatar was the surprise winners in December 2010 of FIFAâ€™s vote to determine the hosts for the 2022 World Cup beating out competition from the United States, South Korea, Japan, and Australia. In recent months, a lot of concerns have been raised about the temperatures in Qatar in summer, when the Cup is scheduled to take place. Fears that searing summer temperatures of more than 40C could pose a risk to the health of players and supporters convinced a lot of sporting officials to try and move the World Cup in winter, when the heat dips to an average of 20C. If this were to happen it would be for the first time in 92 years that the tournament has not been held in the summer. Qatari officials state that they are more than prepared to install air conditioning systems in the stadiums, but this may not be enough to make the games an enjoyable experience for the thousands of fans.
