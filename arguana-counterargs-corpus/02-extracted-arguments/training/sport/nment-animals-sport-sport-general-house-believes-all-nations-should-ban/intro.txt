Bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France and some Latin American countries (Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador), in which one or more bulls are baited and usually killed by a matador in a bullring for sport and entertainment. It is often called a blood sport by its detractors but followers of the spectacle regard it as a fine art and not a sport as there are no elements of competition in the proceedings. Bullfighting is banned in most countries, and has been banned more recently in some countries and regions with long histories and traditions with the event. Most notably, bullfighting was banned in 2010 in the Spanish region of Catalonia and its largest city Barcelona, where it has a centuries long history and attracted international fame. At the same time, places like Madrid have responded to such actions by officially preserving bullfighting as an art form. This means that anti-bullfighting activists can be charged with a crime and a substantial fine for disrupting the patrimony of bullfighting and Spanish culture. These historic actions have re-enlivened the debate about bullfighting in Spain and around the world.
