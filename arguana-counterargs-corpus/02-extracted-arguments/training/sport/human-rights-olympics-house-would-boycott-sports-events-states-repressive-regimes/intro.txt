Sports events have often played host to gestures designed to make political points. Holding as they do worldwide media attention, they act as a platform to highlight the actions of repressive regimes. Both the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the 1984 Games in Los Angeles suffered boycotts from a range of countries protesting against the policies of the host nation. 1993, China bid for the 2000 Olympics, and its failure to win enough IOC votes then was widely linked the international concern over its use of military force to put down student protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Finally, Beijing was awarded the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in 2001. The decision delighted the Chinese government and people, who saw it as international recognition of their countryâ€™s growing economic, sporting and political strength. Others criticised the choice of Beijing as rewarding a dictatorial government with a terrible human rights record and a history of international trouble-making. Proponents, including the Olympic Committee, maintain however that sports events are not the time or place to raise such issues and that they should remain about the athletes, not politics.
