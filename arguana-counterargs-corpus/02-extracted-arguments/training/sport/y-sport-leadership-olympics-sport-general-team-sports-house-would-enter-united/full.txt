# THESIS
This house would enter a united football team for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the Olympics


# INTRO
The United Kingdom is generally seen as the birthplace of football (soccer) as the world currently knows it today. The first formal set of rules were drawn up in the UK by The Football Association in 1863, the first official international game took place in 1872 between Scotland and England in Glasgow and the world's first football league was setup in England in 1888. But despite being the birthplace of the sport the United Kingdom does not currently field a Football team in the Olympic Games. Every four years the debate rages as to whether the UK should field a team in the sport in which it created, however with the 2012 Olympics being awarded to the United Kingdom in 2007 the debate has become much fiercer than usual.

The core reason there has not been a UK Olympic Football team for over 40 years, despite it being the number one sport in the UK, is that the four countries which make up the United Kingdom; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, each have separate independent football bodies, footballing leagues as well as currently playing as separate footballing nations in the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Cup competitions. So should the United Kingdom form a combined team for the Olympics or are the obstacles for this to happen too great?
