At the moment, FIFA does not permit goal-line technology (GLT) or video replays during matches, although it is permitted for post-match disciplinary measures. In a 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board, FIFA "request[ed] the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee". Yet despite this, controversy rages over the so-called ‘ghost’-goals that are all too frequent in the current game. However, on Wednesday 4 th May, The Guardian newspaper reported that FIFA is set to consider the possibility of introducing goal-line technology in time for the 2012-13 season. 1 It is not the first time FIFA has requested that companies undergo a formal testing procedure but there is one key difference this time: they will be permitted to do so at a stadium of their own choosing. Previously, every one of the dozen or so companies who underwent the tests at FIFA House had fallen foul of the short set-up time and unrealistic conditions that were imposed there. There will be a number of strict criteria to satisfy in the two rounds of testing. Technologies must demonstrate a minimum of 90% accuracy in recognising whether both a static or a moving ball is across the line. Technologies must also inform the referee about goal-line incidents with both a vibration and a display signal to his watch, wherever he is on the pitch. The testing will be carried out under both daylight and floodlight conditions. The news will be welcomed by UK companies such as Hawk-Eye and Goalminder, who are convinced that their products are already 100% accurate. This announcement, coupled with FIFAs previously unrelenting stance on GLT, has re-ignited the technology debate. Should GLT be introduced to global football?
