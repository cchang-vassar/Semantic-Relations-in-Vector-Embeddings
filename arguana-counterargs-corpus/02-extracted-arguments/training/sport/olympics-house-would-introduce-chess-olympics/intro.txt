605 million people in the world are estimated to know how to play chess: over 8 million are registered competitively, representing over 160 countries. 1 Despite its presence throughout history and geography, and despite having been recognised as a sport by the International Olympic Committee in 1999, chess has never been a discipline in the Olympic Games.

The World Chess Federation (FIDE) has been campaigning for years for this to happen. Its first attempt in 1924 failed because of problems distinguishing amateur from professional chess players 2, since the Olympic Games were originally restricted to amateurs. Now, however, this criterion has been dropped. 3 Since 2006 chess has also been accepted into the Asian Games, the world's second biggest multi sport games which is organised by the Olympic Council of Asia and recognised by the International Olympic Committee, as a part of the category of board games which also includes weiqi (go) and xiangqi (chinese chess). 4

Yet there are still obstacles to chess being included in the Olympics. It is still rarely perceived as a sport, not to mention an Olympic sport, and the Olympic Games have a limited capacity regarding how many sports they can include. Why then should chess, a mind sport rather than a conventional sport, be included in future games?
