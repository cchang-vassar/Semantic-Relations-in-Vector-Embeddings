In recent years football (soccer to Americans and Australians) has become a huge and highly international business. Once even leading teams were full of players born and brought up within a few miles of the club ground. Now the increasing wealth of the top European leagues, boosted by television money and sponsorship, has sucked in the best players from all over the world. European Union rules have made this easier, as citizens of member states are allowed to work in any EU country without restrictions. However FIFA, the international body in charge of football, has now proposed to do something about the situation. At the 2008 FIFA meeting in Sydney its President, Sepp Blatter, got strong backing for his six-plus-five proposal. This would make football clubs send out no more than five overseas players in their starting eleven.

To opponents of FIFA’s new proposal, the development of Europe’s leagues is a cause for celebration - the nationalism of the past has been set aside and the quality of games has improved with the best players in the world facing each other every week. FIFA and its proponents argue that having too many foreigners harms the chances of domestic (locally-born) players, allows a few rich clubs to win everything, and weakens the national team.
