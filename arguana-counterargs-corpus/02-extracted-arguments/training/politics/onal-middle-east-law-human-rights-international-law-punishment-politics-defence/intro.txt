Ariel Sharon, who was prime minister of Israel from 2001 to 2006, died on the 11 th of January 2014, after eight years in a persistent vegetative state due to a massive stroke. Sharon, who held positions in Israeli governance since 1981, was a highly important figure – but also a highly controversial one. To his supporters, he has been described as the “architect of Israel [1] ”, and a man who aimed to create a peaceful and sustainable Israel [2] . To his opponents, he was a butcher and a war criminal.

Initially a member of the pre-independence paramilitary group Haganah, which formed the core of the nascent IDF when it was formed in 1948, he rose to the rank of major-general, taking part in the 1948 conflict (referred to as the War of Independence by Israelis and the al-Nakba – the catastrophe – by the Palestinians and others) which lead to the independence and recognition of the State of Israel, the Suez crisis, the Six-Day War in 1967 in which Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank and Golan Heights, and the 1973 conflict known variously as the Yom Kippur War or the October War. This included leadership of Unit 101, created in 1953 under orders by then prime minister David Ben-Gurion to carry out reprisal operations [3] . In October 1953, Israeli troops under Sharon’s control attacked Qibya, a village in the West Bank, in which 69 people, mostly women and children, were killed. This was an act of retaliation following attacks from the West Bank in which Israelis were targeted: Sharon wrote in his diary that he was ordered to make the attack “an example for everyone” [4] . These actions were condemned by the UN Security Council [5] .

Entering electoral politics in 1973 as a member of the Israeli legislature, the Knesset, for Likud, he became the security adviser of PM Yitzhak Rabin, he had a spell between 1981 and 1983 as Minister of Defence, during which Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, parts of which were occupied until 1985.

During the conflict, Kataeb, a Lebanese Christian militia, lead a massacre of civilians (between 762 and 3,500) in the Sabra area of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, and the nearby Shalita refugee camp while the IDF prevented those in the areas from leaving. In addition to a UN commission (and a general assembly vote deeming it an act of genocide [6] ), an Israeli inquiry, the Kahan commission, deemed Sharon responsible. He resigned as minister of defence, but remained in government, becoming foreign minister in 1999. He was elected as Prime Minister in 2001, during his term creating a new party, Kadima. While Prime Minister, he lead a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip.
