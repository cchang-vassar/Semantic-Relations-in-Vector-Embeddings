The European Parliament is the democratic organ of the European Union. Elections are done using proportional representation meaning there are multiple candidates elected from each constituency. In the European Union’s case each constituency can be very large with the biggest covering the whole of Germany. There is a lot of standardization but the member states still control some aspects of the elections such as deciding constituencies within certain limits (as with the overall system they need to be proportional to population so the UK could not give Scotland more seats than London and the South East). From 2014 voters will have the opportunity to elect the President of the European Commission even if this is only indirectly because it will depend on which party wins most seats in the European Parliament. [1]

The proposal for this debate is that the current mishmash of differing voting districts decided by member states be replaced with one single voting district across the whole of Europe. Every elector’s vote would count for the same and would be voting for the same options. The electoral system would remain proportional representation as it is at the moment.

There have been proposals for this in the past, [2] in 2010 there was a proposal by Andrew Duff of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that 25 MEPs should be elected by transnational lists however this would hardly be a sweeping change across the whole parliament. [3]

There may be some quite far reaching consequences of this system; for example it would make a lot of sense if rather than every party competing for votes each block within the European Parliament should compete. However as this is a reform that could equally work in the current system this will not be explored in this debate. Another sensible variation on this debate would be to enforce that only national parties can run within each nation state. This would make quite a lot of differences to the arguments; on the prop side the choice and Europe wide thinking points become largely irrelevant while opposition arguments about the complexity of the system become meaningless. But at the same time it creates new questions such as why should there be no possibility for a transnational party representing the Roma?
