Russia has long seen the post-soviet space, the countries of the former USSR, as its special sphere of interest. It has been willing to engage in military adventures within the region. In response to the latest such adventure, in Crimea launched at the end of February 2014 [1] , US Secretary of State John Kerry threatened “He [Russia’s President Putin] is not going to have a Sochi G8, he may not even remain in the G8 if this continues.” [2] The west wants to react to Russia’s military action but has few good choices about what can be done. A military response is impossible due to Russia’s military power. Economic sanctions bring the threat of gas cut-offs to Europe – Russian gas accounts for almost 9% of Germany’s energy use. [3] This leaves the slow process of international institutions; the G8 is one such institution.

The response to the takeover, or invasion, of Crimea has been comparatively mild. After the Crimean Parliament declared the province to be a part of Russia the EU responded with minor sanction “to suspend bilateral talks with the Russian Federation on visa matters as well as talks with the Russian Federation on the New Agreement.” [4] The European Union however held out the possible of further action if the situation is not returned to the status quo ante – what it was before the start of the crisis.

At its foundation in 1975 the G6 of the main western economies of France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, and US was to provide a place for leaders to discuss economic concerns. Canada joined the next year to create the G7 at which size it remained for twenty two years until Russia joined in 1998. As the organisation involves summits and unlike many international organisations has no secretariat it has no specific membership criteria though with the general demand for members to be democracies and highly industrialised; new members are invited by the remaining members, and similarly can be thrown out the same way. [5] The institution has already been chosen as one avenue of showing the west’s displeasure at Russian actions without escalating the situation as the preparatory meeting for the June G8 Summit in Sochi has been cancelled. [6] Since Russia is engaging in actions contrary to the interests of the other seven members should they no longer consider it to be a member?
