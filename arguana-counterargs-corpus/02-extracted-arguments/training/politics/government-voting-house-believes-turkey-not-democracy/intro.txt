Turkey is a democracy, or at least it is usually considered as such. It is the only Middle Eastern, and only country with a Muslim majority, in NATO, and it is a long term applicant to the European Union. However its slow progress in that regard is perhaps an indication that its democracy is not quite as entrenched as many would like. Turkey is a democratic, secular, and constitutional republic, but there are republicans who believe that all of these are threatened by the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) which have been in power for a decade. Until now however concern has not turned into outright protest, and while other areas of the Middle East underwent revolutionary convulsions Turkey has remained high and dry often being seen, not least by Turkey’s leaders, as a model for the new emerging democracies in other parts of the Middle East. [1]

On the 28 th May 2013 a small group of activists attempted to stop the clearance of trees for the redevelopment of a park in Istanbul. The police response was heavy handed using tear gas resulting in growing protests around the park. Attempts a few days later to evict these protestors resulted in injuries to several people; again the result is a surge in the protests rather than the unrest dying down. Over the weekend the protests became much larger in scale centered on Taksim square from which after a battle with demonstrators the police retreated. The protests spread across much of the country and according to the Turkish Doctors’ Association the clashes with police have left 1,000 people injured in Istanbul and 700 in Ankara. [2]

Although the protests were sparked by development of a green space the driving force behind the protest is democracy and fears about the authoritarianism of the ruling party. Protesters argue “He's [Erdoğan] a dictator. Whenever we want to say our beliefs he always says: 'No you can't speak. You are lying and you are very little.'” [3] They link the destruction of the park with taking away public spaces and observers contend that "Erdogan does not listen to anyone any more, Not even to members of his own party.” They believe the protests will force the Prime Minister to listen, others however say they won’t go away until he resigns.

Erdoğan’s response has perhaps been predictable, heaping blame on the opposition and social media; “There is now a menace which is called Twitter… The best examples of lies can be found there. To me, social media is the worst menace to society.” [4] A clear parallel to the ‘Arab Spring’ in Tunisia which some called a ‘Twitter revolution’. However of course there are immense differences; even if it has its faults Turkey is a democracy. Erdoğan has won three terms as Prime Minister which shows his popularity. Moreover the AKP stays in power not because of the army – which is generally linked to the idea of a secular Turkish state that Erdoğan has undermined – as was the case in Egypt but because of his popular support. Attempts to get him to stand down as a result of protests, demonstrations, and violence might very well be considered to be anti-democratic.

There is then a question about whether Turkey is a democracy and perhaps about democracy itself. Democracy can clearly be many different things. At its most basic it is rule by the majority of the people [5] but we usually consider it to be broader. Instead of just rule by the majority we consider democracy to be ‘liberal democracy’ which Claus Offe considers to have four basic elements; statehood – it must be within a defined territory with a functioning government in this case an effective and legitimate government, rule of law which limits the exercise of state power and provides personal rights to the people, political competition between contending parties that contest elections, and the rulers must be accountable not just through elections but also the media and other methods of removing the elite. [6] As the first definition is easily met even by a mob we will look at the second.
