Most democratic constitutions make some provision for the use of referendums – a public vote which asks the electorate its opinion on a specific proposal to change the law or constitution – to consult citizens on matters considered to be of special importance. However, with a few exceptions, most nations use this power extremely infrequently.

Supporters of referendums believe that they are a thoroughly good idea; they return power to the hands of the people, increase engagement with politics, and ensure that everyone’s views are represented in the political debate. But opponents argue that increased use of referendums would not improve decision-making; on the contrary, they say, putting too many questions before the public in referendums leads to short-term policymaking, turns complex, nuanced debates into simplistic campaigns between slogan-wielding factions, and would just irritate voters who are already fed up of politics.
