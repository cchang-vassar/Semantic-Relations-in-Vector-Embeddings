This debate first of all makes the assumption that a strike against terrorists is going to be made. The debate is therefore not focused on whether there should be military action to strike at terrorists but whether we should be using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), sometimes called drones, in order to strike at these targets. UAV’s have a wide variety of uses and capabilities ranging from reconnaissance to research and development but are best known for their use by the United States in attacking suspected terrorist targets. The UAVs used primarily for this purpose are the MQ1 Predators and the MQ9 Reapers. The more advanced reaper has a payload of 3,000 pounds allowing it to carry up to 14 hellfire missiles and it can stay airborne for 14 hours [1] giving its operators plenty of time to confirm the target and choose the ideal time to attack. On 3 rd November 2002 the first UAV attack outside a theatre of war took place to kill suspected al Qaeda terrorists in Yemen. [2] Strikes by UAVs in Pakistan, where they have been most controversial, started on 17 th June 2004 in an attack that killed a local Taliban commander Nek Mohammed and up to four other alleged Taliban however it also resulted in the deaths of two children. [3] Since then there have been about 380 strikes by UAVs in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. [4]
