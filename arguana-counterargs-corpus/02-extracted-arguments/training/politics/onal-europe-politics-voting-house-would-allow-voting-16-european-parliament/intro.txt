The European Parliament is a directly elected body that covers all European Union members. It has 754 members who are elected once every five years. Unusually for a parliament the system for the election of MEPs is not uniform across the Union because this, within guidelines such as all using proportional representation, is left up to the member states to decide. [1] The biggest difference is that some countries have the whole country as one large constituency, such as Germany or Austria, while others split themselves into constituencies each with several MEP’s, Ireland for example has four constituencies with three MEPs representing each. But there are many smaller differences too; some countries vote for individuals and others for party lists, some require a gender balance, some use electronic voting, and even the day on which voting takes place is not uniform. [2] Of greater importance for the voter there are large differences in the number of citizens who are represented by each MEP; from the 2014 elections Germany will have 96 MEPs and Malta 6 [3] since Germany has a population of 82 million against Malta’s 400,000 [4] it has one for every 854,000 inhabitants against Malta’s one MEP per 66,000.

Elections for the European Parliament historically have low turnouts and it has been declining; in 1979 turnout was 61.99% but this had fallen to 43% in 2009. [5] As the legitimacy of a parliament is based on a democratic mandate low turnouts damage the legitimacy of the European Parliament. It is therefore right to explore possible ways of raising the turnout, both in terms of the number of registered electors voting and in terms of the total electorate. The main response from the Parliament is to provide better information about what it does to voters and how it affects voters’ lives; something that is made possible by the increasing powers the parliament has. [6] However the European Parliament could think bigger and as such there have been calls for the EU to lower the voting age to 16 in order to increase turnout as well as “improve intergenerational dialogue” and allow “young Europeans… to have rights matching their duties”. [7]

Debatabase already has a debate on the general issue of lowering the voting age ‘ This House would lower the voting age to 16 ’ and readers of this debate should read that more general debate first. That debate will give you a grounding in the general arguments that are useful for this debate and for the most part apply to this debate even if they are not mentioned here. This debate on the voting age for the European Parliament for the most part has different arguments or where they are the same arguments a different angle has been put to them as a result of EU circumstances.
