Turkey has had a trade agreement with the European Union for over forty years, and first applied for membership of Europe’s premier club nearly forty years ago. Until ten years ago these requests were politely resisted; Turkey was never turned down outright but the EU made it clear that massive political and economic reforms would be needed before entry could even be considered. In 1999, however, EU leaders unanimously accepted Turkey as a candidate country, yet negotiations about entry did not begin until 2005.

Since 2005 the EU accession negotiations for Croatia and Iceland have advanced rapidly, but only one out of 35 chapters has been completed with Turkey; 20 have yet to be opened at all. This has led to Turkish suspicion that the EU is not really serious about ever including it. This suspicion seemed to be confirmed in November 2002, when Valery Giscard D’Estaing, a former President of France, declared that Turkey was an Asiatic nation that should never be allowed to join the European Union. Since then it has become the policy of France, Germany and Austria to oppose Turkish membership of the EU. They and some politicians in other EU states would prefer to offer a privileged partnership short of full membership; something which Turkey rejects. Greece and Cyprus do not reject the prospect of Turkish membership outright, but are insistent that progress should be dependent upon Turkey abandoning support for Northern Cyprus.
