The United States initiated military operations in Libya in early March of 2011, with a broad international coalition under NATO command, in order to defend civilians engaging in a popular revolution against Muammar Gadaffi. The brutal suppression and murder of these civilians by Gadaffi's regime led to calls by the Arab League for NATO action as well as UN Resolution 1973, which authorized the limited mission of protecting Libyan civilians with a no-fly zone. The US and NATO attempted to execute this mandate by bombing select pro-Qaddafi forces and munitions and maintaining air superiority over the country. The US formally transferred command of these operations to NATO on April 1st. The conflict continued apace through June. During this period, it became clear that the US and NATO mission had extended beyond simply protecting civilians to regime change. This has included the active military support of anti-Gadaffi forces as well as targeted bombing campaigns. An international debate has followed these events. Many in the US have claimed that President Obama needed Congressional approval after 60 days of the conflict, in accordance with the War Powers Act. But the President has argued that this law, passed in the wake of the Vietnam War, does not apply because US engagement does not rise to the level of "hostilities" contemplated by the law. Other questions concern whether the war has extended beyond the UN mandate and whether the engagement is even worthwhile for NATO, the US, and the wider world. The pros and cons in this contentious debate are considered below.
