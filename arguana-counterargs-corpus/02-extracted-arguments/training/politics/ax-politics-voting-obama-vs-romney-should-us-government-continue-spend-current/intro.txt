Since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, the federal budget and the taxes that fund it have been the most consistently debated topic in politics. This is because it is an issue from which the most difficult of questions arise: should America be run by “big government,” emulating the European social welfare state, or should it mandate minimal tax regulations, leaving each citizen entirely responsible for his or her well- being? Democrats tend to advocate the former, taxing citizens according to income and providing welfare programs for the less wealthy, while Republicans are proponents of the small, decentralized state and minimal taxation. Nevertheless, how the government spends its money affects all Americans, especially in times of economic downturn.

As it currently stands, the federal budget has reached previously unsurpassed levels, estimated at about $3.7 trillion for 2012 [1], as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. The majority of the budget goes toward the Department of Defence ($1.45 trillion) [2], the Department of Health and Human Services ($1.11 trillion, or roughly $9,700 per household), which administers programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Social Security Administration ($808 billion). Tax cuts, which some economists have argued should be counted into the budget, have most recently been estimated at $1 trillion in 2010, according to the liberal Center for American Progress. [3] The most notable tax cuts, those passed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003, are set to expire on New Year’s Eve this year, and are currently the most discussed topic related to taxes and spending among journalists and pundits, who have hyperbolically dubbed the sun-setting of these tax cuts “Taxmageddon.”

This debate is an edited version of a debate that is part of the US Presidential Election Project and as such there are some differences from normal debatabase debates. The two sides are not necessarily for and against, they may agree on a few things, in this case the need to eventually cut the deficit, but are instead Obama and Romney’s positions so may not add up to a compelling case. As in other debatabase debates the counterpoints will be highlighting the flaws in the argument. The Points For are Barak Obama's position and Points Against Mitt Romney's.
