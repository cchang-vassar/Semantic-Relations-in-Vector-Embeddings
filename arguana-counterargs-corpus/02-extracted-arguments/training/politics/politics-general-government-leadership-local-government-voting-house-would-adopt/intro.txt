Using the electoral system of Proportional Representation (PR) means that the percentage of the popular vote that a party wins becomes the percentage of the seats that party receives in parliament. The person elected to sit in that parliament is usually decided by means of party lists, where the party lists its candidates in order; if it wins 34 seats in parliament, the first 34 candidates on its list are elected as members of that parliament. Many countries use it for national elections, though there are variations in how it is done.

Other countries do not operate PR in elections but use majoritarian systems instead, which give the majority of the seats to the party with a plurality of the vote. Under this system each constituency (a defined geographical area) elects its own representative(s) from among a group of rival candidates competing only for that constituency. In the UK, elections are organised on a First Past The Post (FPTP) basis, where the candidate with the highest number of votes is elected to represent that constituency; in an area where more than two parties attract significant support this usually means the winner has little more than 40% of the popular vote (a Scottish MP was once elected with only 28% of the votes in a tight four-party contest). In Australia, the Alternative Vote (AV) system is used, where voters list candidates in order of preference; candidates with the fewest votes are progressively eliminated from the count and their ballots are individually transferred to the voter's next preference until one candidate receives over 50% support and is duly elected.

The above outline simplifies the situation in most countries, where varying forms of PR may be used, perhaps by having very large constituencies with multiple representatives elected by PR from party lists, or by using PR for some elections and a constituency system for others. Recently, Italy has moved away from PR while the UK has begun to use it for elections to the European Parliament and in the new Scottish, Welsh, Northern Ireland and London assemblies.
