The question of unifying Ireland has been around ever since Ireland was partitioned in 1921. Ireland had first been invaded by the British in 1167 British control was only strongly enforced from 1534. It was then that ‘planation’ occurred, whereby Scottish Presbyterians and British Protestants were invited to settle in Ireland, thus forming a strong protestant society and provide a stock of lords, land owners and powerful figures to control the Irish population. From the 18 th century onwards there was a greater clamor for independence from Britain whilst the protestants in the North of the country preferred to remain part of Britain, culminating in the Home Rule bill of 1921 where the Unionists had managed to secure six Northern counties to be kept separate from the ‘Irish free state’ and remained part of the United Kingdom, creating Northern Ireland. Treatment of the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland by the elite protestant Unionists sparked the beginning of The Troubles. Unionist groups, predominantly but not necessarily protestant, such as the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) fought the pro-Republic forces such as the IRA (Irish Republican Army). The British were inclined to favor the Unionists, believing that if they wanted to be part of the UK, the British had no right to prevent that. Resolution came in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement* which agreed Northern Ireland’s position as a devolved part of the UK, meaning they were answerable to the British parliament but most decisions about governance are made in the Northern Irish Assembly. The agreement ensured that Northern Ireland would remain a devolved part of the UK until there was a majority vote in Northern Ireland in favor of re-unification with the Republic of Ireland. This debate looks at the reason why a united Ireland might be better, more legitimate, morally necessary than a partitioned Ireland.
