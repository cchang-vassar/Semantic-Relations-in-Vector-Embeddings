Labour, together with the Conservatives one of the two parties that dominate UK politics, is traditionally a left of centre party but has, since the mid 1990s been a centrist party rebranded as ‘New Labour’. The Labour party has however lost the last two elections; in 2010 under Gordon Brown, and in 2015 when the leader was Ed Miliband. With Ed Miliband having resigned after his party’s poor performance at the general election Labour engaged in a leadership contest through the summer of 2015. Jeremy Corbyn got onto the ballot with the help of Labour MPs who wanted to increase the bredth of the debate in the contest rather than leaving it between three centerists. [1] However benefitting from a change in the election rules that gives the membership much more say – limiting that of MPs and unions – saw a surge in support for Corbyn who eventually won with 59.5% of the vote.

So what does being left wing actually mean anyway? Generally it means being radical, reforming and socialist. It can be, and often is, progressive. In economic terms it usually means more state control (on behalf of the people) of the economy with it traditionally meaning complete nationalisation. And in social political terms it means more equality and power to the people rather than elites.

Since the consensus for the last couple of decades has been that more state control over the economy is a bad thing having someone who is in favour of it in charge of a major party is potentially a big change. It leads to the question of whether moving to the left is good either for Labour or for the country.
