# THESIS
This House believes the republican party has lost its way


# INTRO
The 2012 Republican campaign, many commentators agree, looks set to be one of the dramatic examples of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in modern American political history. Obama should be a lame duck, incapable of getting any kind of positive messages across and struggling with an economy mired in recession. Although they’re very different personalities and campaigners Obama should – in theory – be in a similar position to Carter but looks closer to Clinton. Although the polls are not terribly strong for him, none of the Republican candidates have fired the public imagination. The pre-primary campaign has been typified by a sort of ‘anyone but Romney’ series of lurches between a range of candidates only to see them embroiled either in scandal or gaffs. Of the six candidates going into the Iowa caucus, only Ron Paul had a distinctive ideological position [i]

It’s difficult to see the party uniting behind any of the candidates and it appears to be suffering from symptoms similar to their fellow conservatives in their crushing defeat at the hands of Tony Blair in 1997. With the Tea Party movement demanding ideological purity from candidates but with little evidence that candidates would be likely to garner widespread support in the electorate as a whole.

In an election that should be a breeze for them, the weaknesses of the Republican party is widely seen as Obama’s strongest suit. Even Vice-President Joe Biden has made it explicit with his repeated comment, “Don’t judge me against the Almighty, judge me against the alternative” [ii] . The election currently looks set to disprove the old mantra of political strategy that oppositions don’t win elections, governments lose them. According to masses of data, including polling information and psephological history, Obama should be on course to lose but the Republicans give the distinct impression of doing their level best to keep him in office. That’s certainly not to say that Obama is out of the woods or that whoever secures the Republican nomination has no chance but the party is clearly split between social and monetary conservatives. Further, the party’s leadership bears little resemblance to its white, working class base. Santorum is the only candidate in the running with any working class credentials at all.

By contrast the socially conservative and evangelical Christian components of the party have not only become the leading voice in the party but have consistently spoken to and delivered states, such as Kansas, which demographically should be blue. With such clout it seems only sensible that candidates should focus on their concerns and speak on their behalf. All candidates, in both parties, address their base during the primaries before returning to a broader, more consensual approach. Many supporters of the party believe that the socially conservative approach - opposing the liberal consensus of much of the media – is not only morally correct but makes good political sense in a nation with genuine social difficulties and all too few solutions to them.

# PRO01A-POINT
The leadership of the Republican Party simply has nothing to do with its membership as a result no candidate has, or can, capture the imagination.

It’s difficult for a predominantly working class party to get all that excited about the choice between a range of millionaires. The Bush presidency made it all too clear that the interests of the rich are the primary interest of the party and that it fails to deliver on areas such as a commitment to smaller government.

As party activists becomes ever more obsessed with issues such as gay marriage or the flag-burning amendment, it simply fails to address the concerns of most Americans to whom it has little to say. Until it has a clearer and reasonable economic message, there is little it has to say and less worth listening to

# PRO01B-COUNTER
Like all parties in a democracy the leadership of the party responds to the concerns of members. Millions of ordinary Americans have genuine concerns about the state of modern America particularly in relation to the encroachment of every day government into their lives and values and imposing the opinions of a small coastal elite onto communities that want nothing to do with them.

The Republican Party increasingly reflects the historical background of the country as well as a position that reflects the belief of most Americans; historically and culturally Christian and mistrustful of an over-mighty state. Although there are nuances between presidential candidates, those statements would be supported by all of them and they appear divided because they are in the middle of a primary campaign.

# PRO02A-POINT
Just as with other parties around the world, once the dominant argument of a political party proves to be a busted flush it takes about a decade to recover

Both the Labour and Conservative parties in the UK, the Conservatives in Canada, the Socialists in France and many others all over the world have gone through periods of regrouping following extended periods in office.

Political movements simply run out of fresh ideas after prolonged periods of government and the Republican Party is going through such a period. The Bush Mantra of a presumption in favour of financial deregulation and in favour of tax cuts to create a trickle-down effect have both been proven to be wrong – or at least were taken to too great an extreme. The country needs to rebalance just as the Republicans need to find new ideas and new standard bearers. Future leaders of the party like Marco Rubio and Tim Pawlenty may have interesting ideas by 2016 but the current leadership is a busted flush [i] .

# PRO02B-COUNTER
The current leadership of the party have strong conservative credentials and stand in stark contrast to the increasingly unpopular Obama who has been deserted by his own party and certainly the enthusiastic youthful idealists who elected him.

It’;s perhaps a sign of the lack of both political and intellectual leadership within the Democratic Party that the Iowa Caucus saw many of those same young enthusiasts who supported Obama switch dramatically to Ron Paul in pursuit of a consistent ideology.

The consistency of the Republican Party in making the argument for lower taxes and smaller government stands in stark contrast to the ever shifting sands of the Democrats.

# PRO03A-POINT
The Republican Party has been hijacked by the Tea Partiers who simply don’t have a coherent message or ideology

The Tea Party movement has hijacked the Republican Party, bullying elected representatives to pursue a very narrow political agenda that has more to do with their moral outlook than the traditional role of politics. The Tea Party has little in the way of a political programme and nothing in the way of understanding the nuances of local politics or the realities of electoral politics.

While the party remains in thrall to this vociferous but unrepresentative minority, it has little to offer the wider party and les to offer the wider American public.

Although they are strident in terms of what they are against, they have little to offer by way of a substantive contribution to the national debate.

# PRO03B-COUNTER
The Tea Party represents not only a community that has been largely ignored in recent elections but one that is also the mainstay of both the Republican Party and of the American Heartland. Namely, white, working class Americans, whose views and interests have been swept away by a party and national establishment that thought their votes could be taken for granted.

While both parties sort out the votes and support of big companies, organised labour, and minority voting blocs the average American was taken for granted. The current approach of the Republican leadership has corrected that directly as a result of the Tea Partiers, returning the party to its traditional values and core voters.


# CON01A-POINT
Having won the economic argument during the Reagan years – both with Russia and the Democratic Party – the Republicans now address social concerns and do so with a consistent message.

Having won the argument over the primacy of the Free Market under Reagan, modern Republicans have turned their attention to other concerns, primarily surrounding the size and role of the federal governments and the social attitudes that are acceptable for the nation to adopt as a whole.

Although the liberal media may grow weary of the message that the majority of Americans hold certain values and expect those to be respected by the government, it remains the case.

The Republican Party has, and continues to be, the strongest and most consistent voice on these matters; defending traditional families and their values.

# CON01B-COUNTER
It is simply untrue to present the Republicans as the party of small government. The two presidents under whom the size of government grew the fastest - both in terms of personnel and expenditure – were Reagan and Bush Jr. When Republicans says they are interested in small government they simply mean that they want it to be small enough to get under the bedroom door; making it more interventionist not less.

They have been reduced to a fringe organisation obsessed with a handful of issues, endlessly mouthed as soundbites to prove their orthodoxy to the most extreme wing of their party which does nothing to endear them to a largely uninterested electorate. In an age of economic austerity, the party simply has nothing meaningful to say on this, the most crucial, matter of the day.

# CON02A-POINT
All parties represent a range of opinions and coalesce around and promote their core values and the Republican debate is simply an example of that

Although there are nuances of belief and differences of approach within the Republican Party, as there are in all political parties, they continue to promote the core values that define the party and the wider movement.

As the primary process demonstrated the is diversity of belief within the party and a healthy sense of debate and that is to be welcomed.

However, the values that the party represents – God, family and patriotism – remain their values of the party’s leadership and the American people

# CON02B-COUNTER
The Republicans have been highjacked by the extreme right of their party, making them virtually unelectable. In any other circumstance Obama should be looking like a sitting duck, with the disarray in the Republican party, it seems unlikely that they will be able to coalesce in any meaningful way around any candidate. The constant acts of regicide against the only credible candidate they have, Mitt Romney, suggests that he simply won’t have the support he needs come the general election. The very fact that he is unpopular with the party because he doesn’t confirm to an extreme of ideological purity is the very thing that makes him electable. Until Republicans recognise that electoral reality, they are doomed.

# CON03A-POINT
The Republican Party is, yet again, suffering from the inability of the mainstream and liberal media to accurately cover political debate they constantly wish to portray healthy discourse as split and schism

It would be deeply unhealthy if there were not a lively discourse in any political movement but the media fails to reflect that fact. Disillusionment with Obama has been growing almost since day one of his presidency and looks set to continue through the rest of 2012, the Republicans, by contrast have a clear message with growing support at all levels. The very fact that they have been so successful in thwarting the more dangerous of Obama’s policies demonstrate that they have both the arguments and the acumen to defeat him in Congress, just as they do for the presidency.

# CON03B-COUNTER
The Republicans are simply left with nothing to say and nowhere to go. As is traditionally the case for politicval parties following a long period of dominance they tend to degenerate into internecine squabbling while they thrash out a new platform for government; one thing that is clear is that they haven’t found it yet.

The approach they are taking both in terms of fighting their battles in public and demanding a certain orthodoxy of their candidates that is, frankly, unelectable suggests that they need at least another four years to work through their ideas.

The media are not bringing some liberal bias to this they are even masking many of the divisions. However, the reality is the party is divided and, more astonishingly, those division take place within an incredibly narrow ideological spectrum.
