A cyber attack is an attack on computer based systems to sabotage them or to spy on others, through such means as viruses, hacking, denial-of-service attacks (i.e. DoS - making the network resource or machine unavailable for its intended users), and others [1][2]. Large scale cyber attacks can be referred to as cyberterrorism, and if carried out by one state against the other in a politically-motivated attack â€“ as cyberwarfare. In this case the potential damage is substantially larger and can range from disabling websites, stealing classified data to disabling essential services such as power grids [3].

Due to its potentially huge impact on the state should a large scale cyber attack succeed, it has been questioned whether a definition of war and acts of war have to be expanded to non-traditional measures [4]. For instance, as of 2011 USA considers cyber attacks as acts of war if they are sufficiently disruptive [5]. However such definition is not universally and internationally accepted as at the moment only an armed conflict is considered an act of war, as defined by the UN Charter [6].
