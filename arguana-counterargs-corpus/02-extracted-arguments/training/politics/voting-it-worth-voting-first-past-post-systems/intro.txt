This debate is specific to first past the post systems (FPTP) such and the United Kingdom and the United States. Some of the arguments will work for other more proportional systems but others won’t as a more proportional system is one potential way of making it more worthwhile for an individual to vote in order to make their vote count. FPTP simply asks people to put a mark against the person they prefer. For a candidate to win under FPTP, they have to get more votes than any other candidate, meaning one may be declared the winner with less than 50% of the votes. As a result it is often argued that voting makes very little difference. First a great many people don’t vote for the candidate who wins as they vote for one of the opposition parties or else don’t vote at all. Then they are only voting for one member of parliament among hundreds, and to make matters worse their representative may not even be in the governing party so may have little opportunity to get through anything they voted for. Finally there is the question of whether the government actually pays attention either to the individual MPs or to their own promises perhaps they instead simply listen to vested interests and lobbyists. [1] As an individual in a nation of millions is it worth voting?

p.s. if you want a motion it would be ‘This House believes it is worth voting in a first past the post system’.
