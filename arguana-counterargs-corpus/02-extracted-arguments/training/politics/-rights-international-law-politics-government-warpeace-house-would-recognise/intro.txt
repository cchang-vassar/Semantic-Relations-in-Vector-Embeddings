On 18 July 1998, the Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court was signed. Pursuant to several decades of drafting and negotiation, the conference at Rome settled the creation of a court with jurisdiction over the most heinous crimes ; namely, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression. The ICC builds on the precedent of the ad hoc tribunals established by UN Security Council resolutions in the 1990s. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) are currently investigating and prosecuting those responsible for commission of some of the most grave violations of human rights in the twentieth century. The establishment of the permanent and standing institution of the ICC at the Hague removed this complex process of negotiation; the difficulty of obtaining Security Council assent; and the perennial problem of securing funding.

The objections raised, by the US specifically, concern the potential for political prosecution, the excessive jurisdiction, and the capacity for crippling costs to any State, whether already a signatory or a current opponent. However, the proponents of the Court maintain it is necessary to ensure war criminals are brought to justice and, in so doing, offer justice to their victims.
