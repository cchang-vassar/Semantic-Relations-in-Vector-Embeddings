In 1952 the United Kingdom became the third country to test and independently developed nuclear weapon. The country continues to have nuclear weapons in its arsenal and is one of the five nuclear weapons states set out in the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty of 1968. However despite having independently developed nuclear weapons the United Kingdom now cooperates with the United States in developing its nuclear weapons. Britain’s current nuclear deterrent is maintained by four Vanguard submarines with the first having been commissioned in 1993. These submarines each carry sixteen trident missiles which were designed by the United States and are provided to the UK by a modification of the previous the Polaris Sales Agreement. [1] The submarines are expected to remain in service until the 2020s. In 2006 the white paper ‘The Future of the United Kingdom’s Nuclear Deterrent’ argued that Britain needs to retain a nuclear deterrent but did not take the final decision on the replacement of trident or if it is retained how much of a deterrent is needed. [2] But because of the long lead time necessary for designing and building replacements work has already started on some of the components which would be necessary for new submarines such as the reactor cores. Despite this the government maintains the final decision on trident has not yet been made and is expected in 2016. [3]
