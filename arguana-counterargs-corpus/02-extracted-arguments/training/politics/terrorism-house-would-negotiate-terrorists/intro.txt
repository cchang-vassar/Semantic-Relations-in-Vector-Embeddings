“We do not negotiate with terrorists.” This is something we regularly hear, both in movies, and from governments. In the hostage situation the gas field at Amenas in January 2013, Algeria Communication Minister Mohamed Said repeated Algeria’s determination “We say that in the face of terrorism, yesterday as today as tomorrow, there will be no negotiation, no blackmail, no respite in the struggle against terrorism”. [1] Algeria’s determination was in part due to its long history of terrorism in the country including a civil war from 1990 to 1999 in which up to 200,000 died against Islamist groups such as the Islamic Salvation Front (who had won an election). The war was a guerrilla campaign and there were numerous massacres on both sides, not something that encourages a moderate attitude. [2] Yet part of the reasoning may also have been that the terrorists in question were only threatening western hostages, they had said they only wanted the Christians and Infidels so the Algerians in the gas complex were safe – possibly not the best way to coerce the Algerian government.

So what is a terrorist? While there is no comprehensive definition that is recognised by everyone the United States defines international terrorism as activities that

“(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State;

(B) appear to be intended—

(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;

(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or

(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and

(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum;” [3]

C can be ignored as the question of whether to negotiate applies equally to domestic as international terrorism. From the definition however the size of the attack does not matter, it can range from a stabbing in Woolwich [4] to the attack on the two towers or bigger.

The key point of the definition is that the terrorists want something from the government and are using violent means to get it. This means that there is clearly something that could be the subject of negotiation. Often the demands are not proportionate or the government is not in a position to answer the demands. In the Algerian example mentioned above the demands included an end to the French action in Mali, something that the Algerian government has no power over and would an immense demand if negotiating with the French government. The other demands by the hostage takers was the release of Islamists from Algerian prisons and a safe corridor to the Malian border, both are much more achievable by the Algerians even if unpalatable. [5] This then could have been the basis of a negotiation.
