National missile defense programs represent efforts to build and deploy ballistic missile interceptors. Since the Reagan administration, the United States has, under various guises, sought to develop technology that would render enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles non-threatening to its people and interests. From the outset, the development of such defensive armaments has been controversial. Were they to be implemented, they would render the nuclear deterrent capability of countries meaningless. Some believe this would make the world safer, generally rendering nuclear weapons useless. Others believe that it will only be a catalyst for war, as countries seek to penetrate one anotherâ€™s strategic missile defenses. Debates hinge around both the efficacy of anti-ballistic missile technology, and whether their implementation will create conflict or be a tool for peace.
