AN ARTFUL taxman, according to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, treasurer to Louis XIV, so plucks the goose as to obtain the most feathers for the least hissing. [1] The issue of how it is best and most fair to tax is one that continues to vex governments. One proposed solution is the so-called 'flat tax, in which a single percentage or rate would be applied to all taxable income and profits without exception or exemption. That is, instead of a 'progressive' tax system where, the more you earn, the greater percentage of your income you pay in tax, under a flat tax everyone would pay exactly the same percentage regardless of their wealth or circumstances. This would also apply to the many areas where currently 'tax credits' or 'tax loopholes' allow some kinds of income, profits and expenditure (not all goods are subject to a sales tax, for example) to be taxed at different rates to others; again, under a flat tax all this would be done away with and a single rate of tax imposed on all income and expenditure, without exceptions or exemptions. Proponents of a flat tax stress the simplicity this brings to a currently complex tax system, and argue that it represents a far more fair way to fund government expenditure. The plans also usually incorporate a 'personal allowance', a level of income beneath which there will be no flat tax on income at all. Opponents tend to focus on the economic utility of the tax credits and exemptions to be abolished, and the regressive and 'unfair' nature of the tax in shifting a greater burden of funding state expenditure to the poor and middle class. This debate largely takes place in the form of contrasting and comparing a system of 'progressive taxation', as currently exists in most nations, with a flat tax system.
