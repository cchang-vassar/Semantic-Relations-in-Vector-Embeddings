Low unemployment is not only crucial for a functioning economy, but for a society. After the 2007 financial crisis and start of the Eurozone crisis in 2009, and subsequent worldwide sluggish economy, unemployment has become more of a problem in the European Union. Concerns about debt and growth have discouraged investment, and in a number of states in the EU, such as Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain, caused states to require bailouts, often under the condition of the imposition of austerity measures. Austerity measures have meant public sector job losses in the countries concerned and even many countries that have not had austerity enforced by the size of their debt have been engaging in cutting back the public sector. As a result, the seasonally adjusted employment rate in the EU as a whole (including both the countries who have been bailed out, and those bailing them out, such as Germany and The Netherlands) has increased from 7.5% in July 2008 [1] to 11% in July 2013 [2] .

Unemployment is not evenly spread across demographic groups, however. According to Eurostat, the group with the highest rate of unemployment is young people – 23.4% of under 25s were unemployed in 2013, compared to 7.6% in 2008 [3] . This does not include people in education so almost a quarter of young people who finish school or university are finding that they cannot find a job. Youth unemployment not only causes problems to individuals, but broader social problems in the countries, in addition to the financial cost of social security, and the wasted potential. The only long term solution to this is an economic recovery however this is something that is unlikely to happen quickly, even once the economy begins to recover it will be years before many countries reach full employment. Therefore, it has been proposed that a solution to youth unemployment is to guarantee young people a temporary job.

This job could last for six months, which could be enough time to gain the skills which are needed to find further work and for the young people to show they can do a job. Government would fund this. Furthermore, government would fund training or preparation necessary for a person to do this. However there would be limits to ensure it is not too expensive to train individuals. The only requirement for private companies would be to create as many roles as needed.
