Once Rio di Janeiro has hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics, Africa will be the only continent not to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games. Previous Olympic bids by African countries include Cairo for 2008 (which did not get past the first stage), and Cape Town, which came third in the voting for the 2004 games behind Rome, and Athens which went on to host the games.

South Africa has a track record of successfully hosting major sporting events. Following coming second in the bidding process for the 2006 tournament, South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA (football) World Cup, the first of two under a since dropped system of continent rotation, beating out competition from Morocco and Egypt. The 2010 tournament "set a new benchmark", according to FIFA Secretary-General Jerome Valcke [1] . South Africa has also hosted the Cricket World Cup in 2003, and the Rugby World Cup in 1995, in which the home team was victorious. The first big sporting event hosted by South Africa after the collapse of apartheid, the 1995 tournament was immortalized by the image of Nelson Mandela handing the trophy over to the victorious Springboks captain, Francois Pienaar, while wearing a shirt and cap of the team which had symbolized white minority rule.

The death of Mandela caused the first post-apartheid South African Olympic medallist, Elana Meyer, to suggest that the time is right for South Africa to host the Olympic Games [2] . Possible venues for a South African games could include Johannesburg (which held the 2010 World Cup final), and Cape Town, which was a candidate for the 2004 games. Johannesburg and Cape Town are considered to be Alpha- and Beta+ world cities, respectively [3] .

It would be best if This House Believes that hosting the Olympics is a good investment for more general arguments about the Olympics were to be read in conjunction with this debate
