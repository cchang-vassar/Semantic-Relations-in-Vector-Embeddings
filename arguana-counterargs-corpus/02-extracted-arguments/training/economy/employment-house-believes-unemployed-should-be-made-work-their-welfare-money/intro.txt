In most developed countries, people who are unable to find work are given "benefits" or "welfare" money to support them whilst they are out of work. Traditionally, people are not required to do any work in return for this money.

In the US, "work-fare" was developed as an alternative to this. Under workfare models, welfare recipients are obliged to perform some work or undergo training in exchange for their welfare payments. There is generally a period of grace at the start of a term of unemployment, during which such work is not obligatory. Advocates argue that the model prevents the dependency culture that serves to lengthen unemployment and simultaneously provides skills to give welfare recipients a better chance of returning to work. Critics however maintain that workfare schemes are harmful to participants and do little to help them find jobs and get off welfare.
