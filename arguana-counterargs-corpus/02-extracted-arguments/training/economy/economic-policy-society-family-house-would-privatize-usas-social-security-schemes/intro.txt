In the US, Social Security is a social insurance program officially called "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" (OASDI), in reference to its three components. The Social Security Act was enacted August 14, 1935, during the Great Depression. It is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax. During 2008, total benefits of $625 billion were paid out versus income (taxes and interest) of $805 billion, a $180 billion annual surplus. An estimated 162 million people paid into the program and 51 million received benefits, roughly 3.2 workers per beneficiary. By dollars paid, the U.S. Social Security program is the largest government program in the world and the single greatest expenditure in the federal budget, with 20.8% for social security, compared to 20.5% for discretionary defence and 20.1% for Medicare/ Medicaid. Due to projected difficulties with social security programs as the United States ages and the ratio of contributors to recipients falls so costing the state more and more, many, including former president Bush, have argued that social security should be privatized (at least partly). This is a situation in which individuals are given subsidized personal accounts ("individual accounts" or "private accounts") through partial privatization of the system. Especially during the 2011-2012 Republican Primary, prominent politicians have claimed that Social Security in its current form represents a ponzi scheme and a 'massive lie'. President Barrack Obama "strongly opposes" privatization.
