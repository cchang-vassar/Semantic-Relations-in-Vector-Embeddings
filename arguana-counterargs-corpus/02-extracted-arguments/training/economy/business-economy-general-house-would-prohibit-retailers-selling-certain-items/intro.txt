Loss leaders are products that retailers sell at a loss – below the cost of sourcing, transporting and storing them. 1 Such below-cost pricing is a tactic used to attract price-conscious consumers into stores, in the hope that they will also spend money on more profitable goods. However, such a practice is banned in a number of European countries (including France and Belgium 2) and selling below cost-price is also restricted in several US states, notably California 3. Ireland banned loss leaders in supermarkets from 1987 until 2005, when the legislation was repealed 4. This seemingly minor strategy has far-reaching and debateable effects. Those concerned include: consumer rights groups who ask if loss leaders exploit consumers; anti-trust groups, who weigh the pros and cons of prohibiting lost leaders on market competition; and, economists who examine the effects of loss leader laws on the prices of goods. Ultimately this is a debate about weighing those concerns and addressing the proper role of government in the economy.
