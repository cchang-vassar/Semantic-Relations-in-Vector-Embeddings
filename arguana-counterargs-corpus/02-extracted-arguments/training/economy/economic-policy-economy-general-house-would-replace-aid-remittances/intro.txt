It has for a long time been recognized that migration is in large part caused by economic factors; people leave poorer rural areas and move to the city, they move from less developed to more developed countries. In each case they are looking for a better life so go to somewhere where they believe they will find it. It has however usually been considered that these people moving around the world in search of work are doing so mostly for themselves, instead it is increasingly clear that they are doing it as much for their families who have been left behind.

The flow of money from migrants has been shooting up in recent years, according to the World Bank remittances topped $530 billion in 2012. This represents a tripling of remittances within the last decade and indeed it is likely that the amount of money being transferred is much higher as many migrants bypass banks and big money transfer companies that provide the date the World Bank is using.

With such huge amounts of money being sent home we might very well ask whether migration could be a driver of development rather than relying on aid? The level of flows of money recorded by the World Bank is more than three times the total of global aid budgets and of course it does not have strings attached to how it is spent. Many countries get huge amounts from remittances; India and China each received more than £60billion, the Philippines and Mexico both had $24billion sent, while Nigeria received $21 billion. For the Philippines in particular $24 billion would represent more than 10% of the country’s GDP. For some small countries this can be even higher, in Liberia remittances receive the equivalent of 31% of the country’s GDP. The amounts are so big that several countries, including the Philippines, have sent up ministries to manage the cash sent from overseas. [1]

Clearly the proposal is not to replace all aid with no change to remittances; this would just be taking something away so would be in no way beneficial to those who receive aid. Instead Official Development Assistance, “Grants and concessional loans for development and welfare purposes from the government sector of a donor country to a developing country or multilateral agency active in development”, [2] would be replaced with increased remittances. This would be spurred by governments taking action in several ways; providing tax breaks and incentives for those sending home remittances, [3] and by reducing the cost of sending money home by dropping the cut taken by banks and wire transfer firms. The G8 has pledged to reduce the cost of global transfers to an average of 5% by 2014, [4] which would be a significant drop from the 9% it is at the moment [5] and the average should be brought down to the 2-3% where it would be if there was sufficient competition. [6]

Note: For the purposes of this debate we are not going to go into detail about whether this will result in more or less money going to developing nations. It will be assumed that the developed countries would be giving as much by their tax breaks and reductions in costs as they would be in aid. This does not seem too unreasonable, ODA from OECD countries was $135bln in 2011 [7] , a drop in transfer costs of 7% would save $37bln, and the rest would be made up by tax breaks and incentives.
