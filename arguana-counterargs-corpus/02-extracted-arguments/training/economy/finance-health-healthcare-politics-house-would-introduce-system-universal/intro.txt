On March 23 rd 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, an act the New York Times calls “the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades”. [1]

The law’s purpose is to insure 30 million more Americans by expanding Medicaid and introducing federal subsidies aimed at lower-income citizens to aid them in buying private health insurance. It will also prohibit insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, create a panel of experts to reduce government reimbursements under Medicare and create incentives for better, bundled services. [2]

However, not all share this vision of the bill and the idea it stands for. Including the successful vote for repealing the legislation in the House, there have been numerous legal challenges launched against it, charging it with being unconstitutional, splitting judges’ in addition to politicians’ opinions down ideological lines. [3]

Additionally, Vermont has recently adopted legislature with the aim of introducing a single-payer form of healthcare, a system where a single provider, usually the government, by 2017, provides all the financing. [4]

With the legislature and the judiciary involved with their arguments, there were 52 million uninsured Americans in 2010, 9 million new on account of unemployment [5] , making the need for such a policy more necessary than ever. Yet on the other hand, the economic downturn shows no signs of abating, thus making the adoption of 930bn dollar bill a costly enterprise for the government and, therefore, for the average taxpayer.
