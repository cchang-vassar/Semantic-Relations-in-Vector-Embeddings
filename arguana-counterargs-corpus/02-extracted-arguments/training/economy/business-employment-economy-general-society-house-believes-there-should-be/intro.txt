Working time regulations are legal restrictions on the amount of time an employee can work for an employer without breaking the law. This debate focuses on the costs and benefits to imposing such a policy for an economy – benefits such as more people employed on a headcount basis, lower workplace related medical issues, increased productivity and lower incidence of employer abuse of employees and costs such as tendency towards automation, outsourcing and policing.

Currently working hours per week are disparate around the globe 1 – US (33.8) Germany (35.5) China (44) Canada (36.4) UK (37) Greece (42.4) South Korea (46.6) France (38) Singapore (46) Spain (39.2) Iceland (41.1) Italy (38.3.) and the correlation between hours worked and GDP/per capita income is hard to discern due to the different regions historical economic overhang and resource base. One would hardly say that Iceland is an economic powerhouse compared to the USA, though it works longer hours - but Iceland has geothermal energy, fish and banana exports, whereas the US has every type of resource known to man and is the breadbasket of the Americas, if not the world. Clearly, the resources to be worked on are a large factor at play. No amount of extra work will bring an Iceland up to a USA’s standards of living or productivity. That said, there is good reason to believe that individual nation’s resources can be maximised through better working arrangements. Would nations be better off if they worked each worker fewer hours?
