Free trade's virtues have been praised for three hundred years. By allowing every country equal access to all markets, the theory says, you guarantee the most efficient allocation of resources and the cheapest prices for consumers. This means reducing tariffs, and quotas, and other forms of protectionism that prevent countries from trading goods freely. Can such a theory work in practice? Specifically, can it help the world's least developed countries provide themselves with a better quality of life? Western liberal rhetoric says it can, and points to international institutions such as the World Trade Organization to promote free trade of goods, and the World Bank to provide credit for development projects. However, so long as the West continues to protect its own agriculture and industries from the international market – such as through the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy, or the United States of America’s bailout of its steel industries – its position is arguably hypocritical, which jeopardizes a full embrace of free trade around the world. This debate centers on the benefits, detriments, and practicality of free trade.
