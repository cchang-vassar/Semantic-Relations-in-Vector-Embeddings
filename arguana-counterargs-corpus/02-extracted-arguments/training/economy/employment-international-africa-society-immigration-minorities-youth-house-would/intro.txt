Migration has remained a key concern in Africa over time; with research focused on identifying the patterns of migration, scope of migration, and fundamentally understand why people move. With 'mobility' identified as a key characteristics of our contemporary age, various trends can be found across Africa. With records showing rising rates in international immigration; and increased inter-continental movement, new theories have emerged to provide reasoning for such realities. Whether as a result of choice or constraint, such as a natural disaster, a livelihood strategy or individual decision to seek employment, the contemporary reality of migration shows movement needs to be prioritised, discussed, and debated. With the stabilisation of an African Union, or Pan-African Agenda, concern over climate change, and complexities of urbanisation, new policies and understandings are required for migration, and migrants.

Therefore in taking a synthesised perspective this debate asks what government policies are needed. Two key relationships are introduced: the relation between migration and development; and that of migration and rights. A free labour market is defined as a market sphere which enables liberty, and freedom, between buyers and sellers, to exchange, trade, and mobilise. In this case, the labour market is referred to in three contexts: internal (synthesising rural and urban markets), crossborders, and regional. The question remains, by encouraging a laissez-faire approach to the movement of people, goods, and services, can a solution be found to underlying issues across Africa?

In debating the relevance of a free labour market, and migration, across Africa this debate centres on why it remains important in contemporary Africa; and to what extent the policy will have desirable practical effects. Can the rights of migrants be met; and what opportunities does migration raise?
