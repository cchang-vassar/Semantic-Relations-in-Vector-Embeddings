Greece’s economic woes have been at the forefront of the Eurozone debt crisis over the last few years. It has received bailout packages in the form of emergency low interest rate loans in excess of €200 billion and has written off a portion of the existing public debt. Greece’s public debt rose to dangerous highs of 165% of its GDP in 2010 and its Budget Deficit reached a record high of 16% in 2009. Putting these figures into context, the membership criteria for the Eurozone under the Maastricht Treaty dictates that governments must maintain a budget deficit below 3% and total debt must not exceed 60% of GDP. Although it is true that most other European nations do not conform to these criteria, Greece tops the charts comfortably in terms of debt % GDP and only Ireland has a larger budget deficit.

‘Today’s crisis in Greece is mainly the result of short-sighted policies from the part of 1980s PASOK [main leftist party] governments, in two important respects: (a) PASOK’s economic policies created a deadly mix of a bloated and inefficient welfare state with stifling intervention and overregulation of the private sector. (b) The political legacy of PASOK was even more devastating in the long-term, since its political success transformed Greece’s conservative party (“New Democracy”) into a poor photocopy of PASOK. From 1981 to 2009 both parties mainly of offered welfare populism, cronyism, statism, nepotism, protectionism, and paternalism.’[1] Subsequently, the nation’s public sector grew and now employs one fifth of the total Greek workforce. Crucially, however, PASOK’s legacy was to create a welfare state riddled with inefficiencies and corruption causing it to leak from all directions. Tax evasion has been a huge problem in the country and is estimated to cost the Greek Government €20-30 billion (i.e. two thirds of the budget deficit) every year. [2] Indeed, the unreported (untaxed) proportion of the Greek economy is thought to amount 25% GDP [3]. What’s more, the gravity and unsustainability of Greece’s debt only became apparent in 2008-9 because the Greek Government employed Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs to help them fudge the numbers and deceive lenders. [4]

Two bailout packages later, and the Greek economy shows limited signs of recovery. The severe austerity measures enforced on the Greek Government by the “troika” constituting the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission, have done little more than keep the country afloat and prevent it from defaulting (although the budget deficit has dropped to below 10%)[5]. The austerity measures have largely have largely taken the form of drastic increases in income tax, corporate tax and VAT and reduction of the minimum wage (in an attempt to make the private sector more competitive). Thus far, the results have been hard felt: Greece is in its fourth consecutive year of recession and the economy is shrinking at an unparalleled rate (7% so far in 2012). Unemployment in Greece is second highest in Europe (after Spain), at over 20%, while youth unemployment is at 36%. [6] The theory behind harsh austerity measures is that short term pain will eventually lead to a more efficient and competitive economy and, hopefully, a budget surplus that would start eroding at the total debt. Such targets certainly seem unattainable for Greece in the near future.

The Greek coalition Government headed by Antonis Samaras unilaterally seeks to remain in the Eurozone, but has been trying to persuade the ECB, IMF and European Commission to reduce the severity of the austerity measures, primarily by demanding more time with which to implement the measures. Such demands have so far been outright rejected. An alternative to austerity measures that many call for, could be for Greece to undergo an orderly default and leave the Eurozone. Such a scheme would most likely be undertaken overnight so as to lessen the impact of speculation about a possible default. Although it is true that a Greek Government default does not necessarily lead to them exiting the Eurozone, most believe it would follow, and for the purposes of this debate it will be assumed that that would be the case. Exiting the Eurozone would mean Greece would have to adopt a national currency – in most likelihood their pre-Euro Drachma. ‘Briefly put: the return to the drachma should be sudden, accompanied by a short bank holiday and immediate imposition of capital controls’ [7] to prevent mass outflow of capital from the country. It would also most likely be accompanied by an ECB and European Commission backed bailout package to support the Greek banking system. [8]
