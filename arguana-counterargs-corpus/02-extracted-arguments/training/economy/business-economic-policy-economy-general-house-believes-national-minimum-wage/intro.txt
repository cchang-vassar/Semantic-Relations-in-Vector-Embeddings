A minimum wage is the minimum price at which firms may hire workers, and conversely at which individuals can sell their labor. The government usually sets the minimum wage level at a point that will increase the wages of the lowest earners. New Zealand was the first country to set any kind of minimum wage law when it established arbitration boards in the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1894. There is now some kind of minimum wage or collective bargaining legislation over the minimum wage in more than 90% of countries. There are however large differences in terms of the level of the minimum and how it is set. The United Kingdom for example has a National Minimum Wage set at £5.93 per hour for workers over 21 years old with lower rates for younger people. [1] There is another group of countries that do not have national minimum wages but do have collectively agreed minimum wages. These are usually decided per sector, countries that use this form of collective bargaining to set minimum wages include German and Italy. [2] A few countries such as Macedonia have no minimum wage at all. [3] Opponents of the minimum wage argue that everything should be left to the free market and use supply and demand theory to argue that unemployment will be the result of a minimum, as firms will be unwilling to pay the extra price for workers. Proponents however instead focus on social justice and the exploitation of workers, particularly the most vulnerable.
