The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an intergovernmental organization that was set up in 1945 to oversee the global financial system by keeping in check its members’ balance of payments and the strength of their currency. It has 187 members to date. It also offers loans, mainly to its poorer members, that are usually accompanied by firm requirements to implement neoliberal economic policies, like cutting public spending and lowering corporate tax rates to balance budgets and reduce deficits. The members of the IMF have different numbers of votes, according to their ‘quotas’, which are calculated according to the financial contributions they make to the Fund and their share of the world economy. The IMF’s main governing organ is an executive board comprised of 24 executive directors, 5 directly appointed by the five states with the largest quotas (US, Japan, Germany, France, UK), and 19 elected by the rest of the member states. The executive board has the task of confirming the selection for Managing Director, the head of the IMF. Due to a historical agreement, a European has always held this role, with the second in command from the United States. However, this convention is increasingly being called into question, as well as the Western countries’ dominant share of the total number of votes and decision-making powers within the organization.

The proposal is to reweigh the quota system, ensuring the balance of power reflects the growth in the share of world economic activity now accounted for by BRICs and formerly developing countries.
