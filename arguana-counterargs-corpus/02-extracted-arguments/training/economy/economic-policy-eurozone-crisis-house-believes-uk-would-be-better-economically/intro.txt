At the referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Union a key issue will be the economy. Many voters will ask themselves whether they personally will be better off if the UK stays in or leaves. The economy is quite possibly the most important area of debate in the referendum; trust in managing the economy is a key factor in elections, people are unlikely to vote for something if they think it will make them worse off. In this referendum 55% put it as one of the three most important factors influencing their decision. [1] As a result a main plank of the campaign to stay in the EU, Remain’s, agenda is to show the negative economic consequences of leaving. Vote Leave on the other hand seeks to undermine confidence in Remain’s forecasts, and point to the possible reductions in bureaucracy and wider ability to trade with the world beyond Europe.

What is ‘better off’ in the context of a debate about Europe is a slippery concept. While there likely will be short term economic pain due to the unavoidable uncertainty should there be a vote to leave it is quite possible for the UK to be better off in the long term. And in the long term the economy will be bigger regardless of the vote, the question is how much bigger? Moreover the longer into the future the more inexact economic forecasts get. There are many unknowns; what will be the reaction of the remaining EU members, what trade deal will a departing UK get, will foreign investment really move to other European countries? Since no one knows the full answer to these or many other questions each side can simply give reasons for why their outcome is more likely.
