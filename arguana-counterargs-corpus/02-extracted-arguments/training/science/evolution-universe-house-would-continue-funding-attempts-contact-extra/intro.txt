Efforts to contact extraterrestrials have been ongoing since the end of the 19th century, but it was only in the 1980s that well-funded foundations and government operations with the express purpose of making contact with intelligent alien life began to emerge. In recent decades unmanned probes and beamed messages have been sent from Earth in the hope of contacting, or detecting the existence of, extraterrestrials. Probes have been launched and scanners set up by several countries and international bodies, including the United States, Russia, Japan, and the European Space Agency, as well as numerous private organizations. These efforts have as yet yielded no positive results, which has caused many critics from both the political and scientific world to denounce the search as fruitless; they insist that were aliens within range of humans' messages, they would have had ample time to respond, leading many to conclude that humanity is the only intelligent life in at least this area of the galaxy. Critics also caution that should extraterrestrials exist they may not be friendly, making Earth's broadcasting of its position and technological capability imprudent in the extreme. Supporters of efforts to make contact insist that the boons of knowledge to be gained from both cultural and technological sharing are too great to ignore and that the search for life beyond the Earth can serve to give mankind a transcendent purpose it lacks on Earth. Debates on this issue revolve around the efficacy of doing so, and whether what could be gained from aliens outweighs the potential costs.
