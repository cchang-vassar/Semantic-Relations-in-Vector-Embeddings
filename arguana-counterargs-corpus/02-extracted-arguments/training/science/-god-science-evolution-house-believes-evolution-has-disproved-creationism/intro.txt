Evolution is the process by which species change and adapt over time. Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection explains the origin and diversity of species in terms of ‘survival of the fittest’: characteristics that are beneficial to survival within a given environment are more likely to be passed on to the next generation. Life arose through random mutations over millions of years filtered by natural selection. Evolution is widely accepted by the scientific community as a fact and as a complete explanation, requiring no supernatural element.

Young Earth Creationism is the belief that God directly created the world, including animal and human life, in six days within the last 10,000 years. It is held by some Christians on the basis of a literal reading of Genesis, and also by some Muslims. Creationists claim support for this belief both from religious scriptures and from science. Other Christian views include Old Earth Creationism (God created the world millions of years ago, before creating animals and humans later), and Theistic Evolution (God used or directed evolution to bring about human life).
