# THESIS
This house believes Macs are better than PCs


# INTRO
Ask anyone whether they prefer Macs or PCs, and you’ll most likely get yourself into a heated discussion of which is superior. Macs are made by Apple and run Apple Operating System. PC (personal computers) refers to a broad variety of computers made by many different companies, including Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and more. Although Macs do not sell in as high a quantity as PCs, they do comprise 91% of computers that cost $1,000 or more. [1] Are they truly better, or simply more expensive?
