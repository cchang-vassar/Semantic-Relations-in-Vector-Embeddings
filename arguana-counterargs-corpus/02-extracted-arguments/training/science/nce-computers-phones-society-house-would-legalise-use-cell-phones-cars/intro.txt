In little more than a decade, mobile phones have become widespread in developed countries, changing the way people communicate and interact. Concerns over their use have tended to centre upon the effects of radio emissions upon the brain, but more recently mobile phones have been blamed for causing a considerable number of road accidents. As a result, a number of countries are seriously considering a ban on using a mobile phone while driving, following the lead of Eire and the State of New York in the USA.

In the UK the government has already banned the use of handheld mobile phones, but still allows the use of hands free kits. This ban also exists within a few US states as well as in countries such as Australia. As such, the motion before the house can vary based on the initial assumption the person setting the debate makes. For the purposes of this summary it will be assumed that the use of cell phones in cars is legal. It is also important to note that as its implementation across a large number of countries might suggest, this debate is likely to strongly favour the side advocating the ban of cell phones in cars. Generally, the proposition should include both normal and hands free sets.
