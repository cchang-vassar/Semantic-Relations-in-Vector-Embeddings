When Google.cn (a China-specific, local google homepage) first launched in 2006, it complied with Chinese censorship regulations, but not wholeheartedly: whenever search results were restricted from a search at google.cn, the user would get a notification that certain results had been censored. At the same time, an uncensored, Chinese-language version of the global google.com search engine remained available.

However, early January 2010, David Drummond, Senior Vice President (SVP) of Google, announced on his blog that Google would stop censoring results on google.cn. One clear motivation for this was Google’s discovery that Chinese hackers had been attacking their services. Another evident concern was Google unease with increasing pressure of the Chinese government to censor even more results. This is why Google announced its intention to stop censoring results on google.cn. [1] In March 2010, Google stopped censoring results and offered an automatic browser redirect from google.cn to its local search engine in Hong Kong. [2] This basically had the effect of making Google’s website more difficult to control for the Chinese authorities and easier for Chinese users to access censored, content, without obviously breaking Chinese law. Access to this site is restricted for mainland Chinese users via the Chinese government’s ‘Golden Shield’, also called ‘The Great Firewall’. The Chinese government retaliated by threatening to remove Google’s ‘Internet Content Provider license’.

From June 2010, onwards, google.cn is fully operational and is fully compliant again with Chinese censorship rules, just as it was before. The only difference is that there is a direct link to the Hong Kong search engine. [3] Chinese internet users do receive notification when results are censored on google.cn.

This casefile asks whether Google should go back to its policy of March 2010, and offer fully uncensored search results on google.cn.
