Universities are massive engines of research and development. The state, private charities and corporations all pour money into these institutions to develop and expand the bounds of human understanding. Billions of dollars and euros are spent by taxpayers on useful researches and teaching for the benefit of all. The top 200 research universities in the US spent $51.7 billion on research in 2009. [1] Despite the wealth of US universities as institutions they still get much of their funding from the government. In 2011 62.6% of the money spent by universities on research and development came from the U.S. Federal government, with more coming from local and state governments. [2] And this is in the developed country where universities are most privatised.

But it is argued by some that the benefits of university research are not shared widely enough in society, with universities retaining full ownership for the most part of their academic work [3] . By allowing research to enter the public sphere, the argument goes, the state can more effectively spread the benefits of its own largesse and do its duty to all its citizens to provide them with the full benefit of what it produces with their tax money. On the other side of the debate are those who say that in order to promote effective research, universities need to retain control of their academic work, and the other investors demand preferred access to the work to make good on their investments.

The following debate outlines the various arguments both in terms of state duty when it funds research and in terms of the best outcomes the state can produce from its funding for all.
