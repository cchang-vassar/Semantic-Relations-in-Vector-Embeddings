Mankind has always been a race of explorers. Traveling first across the surface of the planet, then scaling mountains, penetrating the depths of the sea, and finally venturing out into space. There is a great deal of controversy regarding manned space flight, which has been part of life since the Space Race of the 1960s. Supporters of manned space flight argue that space exploration is essential to humanity’s understanding of the universe and its place within it, and that human pilots have the dexterity of mind and body essential to successful missions, things even the most advanced robots and computers lack. At the moment there is little manned space flight. The United States has retired the shuttle, its workhorse for taking astronauts into space meaning that the International Space Station’s future is at risk. Other nations are however beginning to take up the slack. China has launched a man into orbit while India and Japan both plan to.
