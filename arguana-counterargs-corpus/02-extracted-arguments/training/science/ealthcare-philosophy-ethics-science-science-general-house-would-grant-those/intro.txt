Clinical trials 1,2 have four phases, which proceed sequentially. Not all drugs make it to the end of the process (if a drug ‘fails’ a phase 1 trial, there is little point in running it through phase 2!).

Preclinical trials: These happen in a lab, and whilst they almost invariably involve testing on animals, do not involve human testing. The purpose of these trials is to establish whether the drug is safe and effective.

Phase 1 trials:

The purpose of phase 1 trials is to discover possible side-effects, establish efficacy in humans and calculate what dosage is needed.

These trials are the first to involve humans, and so involve a degree of risk. To minimise this, researchers test on small groups (normally giving progressively greater doses to successive groups) using small doses. Sometimes healthy volunteers are used in these trials, and other times people who are very ill are recruited (e.g. the trial of a new cancer drug). Whether healthy or unwell volunteers are used depends on factors like whether the treatment involves a level of risk unacceptable to the healthy (e.g. a new form of chemotherapy would normally be trialled in an advanced cancer patient, because the level of risk and severity of expected side-effects are not acceptable to those who have nothing to gain. Further relevant factors include whether or not the treatment is feasible in a healthy volunteer.

Phase 2 trials:

Phase 2 trials test the treatment on larger groups of people with the relevant illness. The purpose is to find out more about the efficacy of the drug (including which specific thing it treats best, e.g. a new form of chemotherapy might work better on some forms of cancer than others) and more about side-effects.

These trials are tested against a placebo (e.g. an identical pill that doesn’t contain any medication). That is, those recruited into the trial will be split into two groups, one of which receives the medicine, the other of which receives a placebo. These are normally conducted under ‘double blind’ conditions: whilst everyone involved knows that there is the possibility of receiving a placebo, neither the patient nor the doctor giving the pill knows who is receiving what (obviously who gets what is nevertheless recorded). The purpose of this is to find out whether the effect the treatment has is due to the drug, or whether it’s just due to the expectation of getting better (placebo effect).

Phase 3 trials:

The purpose of phase 3 trials is to determine whether or not the new drug/treatment is better than the best currently available treatment.

Because this is a difficult thing to test, and may involve the measurement of small differences between treatments, a large sample size is needed (many people must be tested on). For example, if we were testing a new drug for cancer (let’s call it Newafex) we would get a big group of people, give half of them Newafex, and the other half would receive the best current treatement (whatever drug they would have had if Newafex didn’t exist; let’s call it Oldafex). Then we look at remission rates (the percentage of people who get a bit better) and compare.

A new drug is unlikely to get a license if it is not more effective than other drugs, although there are exceptions (if, for example, the side-effects are less severe, or variety is needed).

Phase 4 trials:

These occur after a drug has been granted a licence (and is allowed to be prescribed by doctors). Their purpose is to determine the long term risks and benefits of the treatment, and monitor its performance when used more widely. These go on for many years (and severe long term side-effects are rare), and it would consequently be impractical to perform this sort of long term testing before licensing

Getting on to a clinical trial:

Patients who may benefit from a treatment that is being trialled can be referred to that trial by their doctors; the company trialling the drug will have criteria that that patient must meet in order to qualify for the trail and it is ultimately at their discretion, not the doctor’s, whether someone is accepted.

Healthy volunteers participating in phase 1 trials tend to be recruited through adverts, and are normally paid well for their participation.

Some countries do already allow the provision of unapproved drugs that are still going through trials on compassionate grounds through programs such as Expanded Access to Investigational Drugs for Treatment Use (United States), Special Access Program (Canada), and Temporary Authorisation for Use (France). 3
