Nuclear energy is one of the main sources of energy in today’s European Union. Currently 14 EU countries use nuclear power plants to produce electrical energy. Together 137 power plant blocks are deployed with total output of more than 125 GW [1] . The produced energy of these plants covers 28.5% of EU’s energy consumption as of 2010 [2] . Nuclear power plants are therefore currently a vital component in providing the EU with electric energy. However, after the Fukushima accident in 2011 many started calling for the end of nuclear energy in the EU, thus adding to the discussion started long ago as a result of worries about nuclear disasters and nuclear waste. For instance Germany in direct response to Fukushima accident decided to speed up its planned phase out nuclear power plants by 2022. In the UK on the other hand in October 2013 agreed the construction of the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in twenty years and there may be more to come. [3] The question of what to do with nuclear energy in the European Union is therefore a current debate that affects countries all over the Union. In this debate we will look upon arguments in favour and against closing all nuclear power plants in the EU and substituting them with other forms of energy production. Of course this cannot be done overnight, thus we are dealing with long-term time frame (about a decade).
