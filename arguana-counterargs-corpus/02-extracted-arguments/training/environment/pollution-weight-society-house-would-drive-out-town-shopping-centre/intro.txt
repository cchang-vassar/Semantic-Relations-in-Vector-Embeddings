The growth of large hypermarkets, especially as they have moved out of town centres, has been controversial. Its impact on traditional local retailers is hotly debated. America's experience with Wal-Mart is often used as a prime example, but this is phenomenon which is now extensively replicated in all continents, except Africa, and even there chain enterprises are starting to impact on traditional retailing operations. France, home of the hypermarket pioneer Carrefour and other giant retailers, now places restrictions on their expansion and ability to offer loss-leader reductions (selling a product below cost price as a way of bringing shoppers into the store). Proponents of the centres argue they offer shoppers a better experience and generate development and investment in the local area. Opponents maintain however that they destroy town centres, degrade the environment and erode local identities.
