There are several definitions of adaptation in this context but, broadly, it is the idea that climate change is a reality, and that changes in human and natural systems will allow humanity to both minimize the damage it does and also benefit from some of those changes. For example the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] defines it as “actions taken to [allow] communities and ecosystems [to] cope with changing climate conditions”. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] has a slightly different nuance; “adjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.” The UN Development Program prefers; “A process by which strategies to moderate, cope with and take advantage of the consequences of climatic changes are enhanced, developed, and implemented.” [i]

For all of the slight differences in tone – “actual or expected” as opposed to “consequences” for example – the underlying intent is still the same. It is predicated on the views that

1) Climate change is or soon will be a reality;

2) Efforts to prevent it will have been left too late.

There are difficulties with both of these presumptions as there are sizable chunks of the public policy community worldwide would not accept either of them. Although it is worth noting that (2) is less of a hurdle – actions to, for example, control future carbon emissions do not exclude efforts to adapt to the consequences of those that have already happened or what is predicted will happen. However, in the words Paelkhe, writing in the Seventies, if we accept that it’s too late to prevent environmental problems, “why not barbecue the last polar bear with the last pint of oil?”

Adaptation to so seismic a shift is likely to have enormously far-reaching consequences covering migration, agriculture and its supporting industries, logging, fisheries, the very survival of low-lying and island nations and other aspects of basic life. In addition there are significant health implications as climate affects not only virology and immunology but also tolerance to humidity and shifts in, for example the malaria belt. All of that is before changes in basic chemistry such as the salinity of the oceans and the implications of that for the basic chemistry of the atmosphere.

However, Opposition also face a considerable challenge. If prevention is prioritized over adaption; how can that be made to work? Efforts so far to control global carbon emissions have proved singularly ineffectual [ii] . With the growth of the BRIC economies disproportionately reliant on carbon fuel sources – notably the dirtiest of them all, coal – that problem looks set to increase. How, in practical terms, can policy address that need?
