European Badgers are mammals that are 60-90 cm long and 25-30 cm high when an adult. They are wedge shaped with their heads being most recognisable due to their white and black stripes. They are common throughout Europe and Asia Minor. While the badger was once hunted this is no longer common, but because they are common animals – that in some areas are actually increasing in numbers they are not generally protected. The exception is the UK where in 1992 the Protection of Badgers act was passed. This makes it an offence to “wilfully kills, injures or takes, or attempts to kill, injure or take, a badger.” And even an offence to have possession of “any dead badger or any part of, or anything derived from, a dead badger.” Additionally it prevents cruelty to badgers and interference with badger’s setts. [1] This act came on top of the Badgers Act 1973 which also prevented the killing of badgers but had an exception for culling in reaction to bovine TB outbreaks. [2]

But while the UK is supposedly committed to protecting badgers the government is now starting a pilot culling of badgers in west Gloucestershire and west Somerset. The cull is a response to bovine TB. Bovine TB is a disease in cattle that also affects other species; it can spread from cow to cow and from badgers to cows. It is considered to be one of the biggest challenges facing the cattle industry. It can be passed to humans where it creates an infection very similar to normal TB but less than 1% of all cases of TB in humans are the result of transmission from cattle or badgers. [3]

Bovine TB has increased rapidly since the 1990s but the cause is not known for certain. As the incidence of infection has increased so have the calls for the government to do something to reverse the increase. The government vacillated first deciding against any cull in July 2008 however after elections in 2010 this decision was reversed by the new government. Two trials in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset was initially set to start at the end of 2012 but were first delayed sue to a request for more time for preparations and then as a result of finding a higher than expected number of badgers in the areas for culling. [4] The cull finally began on the 27 th August 2013.
