Perhaps ironically, one of the effects of climate change has been to open up new areas of the polar caps – previously unreachable –for use by human beings, including for mineral extraction. The political situation in the Arctic Ocean gives added bite to the situation, with several countries making claims to the arctic ocean and so its sea bed with attendant mineral wealth.

The relationship between preservation and development is always a difficult one. There are various balances in play – between modern jobs and cultural heritage, between energy needs and environmental protection, between the possible needs of future generations and the all too pressing interests of the current one.

Although much of the noise in this area has been generated in relation to US plans in Alaska, the interests of other nations with Arctic territory - Russia, Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland - are also likely to dominate the issue for decades to come. All these states, plus representatives of six indigenous populations are members of the Artic Council , which has de facto governance responsibility for the region – although the territorial claims of the nation states end at the 200km limit of sovereignty as would be the case with the demarcation of other maritime territories. Norway, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all made claims to extend their territorial claims beyond that limit, as is allowed under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea when the continental shelf extends beyond this limit. Russia even went as far as to plant a flag on the seabed in 2007. [1]

The primary resources available through arctic exploration are oil, gas, minerals, fresh water (1/5 of the world’s water supply) and fish. But there is also interest in opening up new shipping routes through the region which would reduce travel times from East Asia to Europe and North America’s Atlantic Seaboard. The region also has enormous biodiversity, especially in terms of genotypes that are unique to the habitat.

The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that the total volume of sea ice has reduced in the last 30 years. [2] However, commentators of varying degrees of credibility have put forward a wide range of explanations for the change. It is important not to conflate two different debates when discussing this topic. At one level – the interest of this debate – there is the issue of how to manage the Arctic itself. The issue of the wider implications of climate change, including the impact of arctic warming on salinity and temperature in the world’s oceans, whilst interesting, are a separate issue.

Although there are various definitions of what constitutes the Arctic – many of them including sub-arctic, sparsely populated forest and tundra – for the purposes of this debate it is that area north of the Arctic Circle (66° 33'N). The total size of this area is 40,000,000 km 2 (15,000,000 sq mi) and covers 8% of the Earth. [3]

By ‘exploitation’ this motion will be considered to primarily refer to exploration and drilling for mineral resources. A secondary issue is the shipping opportunities and the transportation of these resources, It’s worth noting that increased opportunities for tourism has also caused some concern but the main focus of the global discussion on this issue as related to the exploitation of resources. Primarily the focus is on oil and gas rather than the considerably smaller reserves of other resources. The issue of the ownership of fishing rights is also important but will not be touched on here as it has received far less coverage and comment in the current climate.

The various attempts that have been made so far to extend the claims of Arctic nations to greater parts of the sea bed and ocean, as well as efforts to rapidly increase drilling within domestic territory, has led many – environmentalists and others – to suggest that a treaty is needed to protect the whole of the Arctic. This could be modelled on the Antarctic Treaty which freezes territorial claims and bans any military activity in the region; this would not affect current territory but would prevent any militarisation of the Arctic Ocean. It would add to this an equivalent of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities which does not entirely ban extraction but prevents such activity until it is judged that there would be no adverse environmental impact.
