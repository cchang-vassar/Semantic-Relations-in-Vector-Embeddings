An 'endangered species' is a population of organisms (either plant or animal) which is at risk of becoming extinct because it is either few in numbers, or threatened by changing environmental or through being directly killed by other species (including humans). Many nations have laws offering protection to conservation relevant species: for example, forbidding hunting, restricting land development or creating preserves. 'Biodiversity' means the variety of bacteria, plants, and animals that live on our planet. This includes the unique behavioural patterns and activities of each species. Biodiversity is an ecological concept discussed in many scientific circles. Many debates about biodiversity will ultimately boil down to how important this diversity is, either for its own sake, or for some specific human benefits.
