On the 30 th May 2011, the Ethiopian government announced plans for the construction of the ‘Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam’ (GERD). Set to be Africa’s largest gravity dam at 170 m tall and 1,800 m wide, it will span the width of one of two major tributaries that create the Nile; the Blue Nile [1] . The GERD is expected to be completed by July 2017 and will produce 6,000 MW of electricity. The dam is expected to be able to generate energy for all of Ethiopia, however Egypt’s and Sudan’s positions downstream from the GERD have made them question the impact of the dam on their respective countries.

Over the next two years tensions continued to mount. The majority of Egypt’s water comes from outside its borders, the Nile is 96% of Egypt’s renewable water, [2] which has led Egypt to fervently defend its water rights [3] . Instability within Egypt, caused by the Arab Spring and the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak, meant that the issue was not addressed until Mohamed Morsi was elected as president [4] . During the year that Morsi spent in office, and the months afterwards where an interim government took charge, there have been rising political tensions between the two states disputing whether Ethiopia really does have the right to build the GERD.
