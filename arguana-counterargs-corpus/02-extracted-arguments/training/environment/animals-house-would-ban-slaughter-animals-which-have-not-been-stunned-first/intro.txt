Most countries have regulations about animal slaughter to ensure that the animal is killed as painlessly and quickly as possible. All slaughter methods have three key stages: restraining the animal, incapacitating it and bleeding it. Different abattoirs carry this out in different ways.

Many abattoirs will “stun” the animal before killing. Methods vary between different species of animal. Cattle are shot with a “captive bolt gun,” poultry are electrocuted by dipping them in a bath with a current running through it, and pigs are often gassed with carbon dioxide. Depending on the precise method being used, this may be done before or after restraining it. Proponents of stunning argue that it makes the animal fall unconscious immediately. When it is then bled and killed, it will feel no pain, making it the most humane way to slaughter.

However, stunning is problematic for Jewish and Islamic communities. Judaism requires that only “kosher” food be eaten. The Bible specifies that, for meat, “you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks… as I have commanded you.” [1] Traditional interpretations recorded in the Talmud – a 5 th-century compilation of Jewish law, which is believed by Jews to date back to Moses – include the requirement that the animal is healthy before death, and stunning them in these ways can terminally injure, or even kill outright, the animal. [2]

Similar principles apply to halal meat – the Quran specifically forbids certain methods of slaughter, so it is important to know that the animal died from being cut and the subsequent bleeding rather than the stun. [3] Some Islamic scholars have accepted a form of stunning which is reversible, [4] but there is no general consensus on whether this satisfies Sharia law, and take-up varies between countries. [5]

It remains the case that many Islamic abattoirs, and all Jewish ones, do not use stunning. The methods of slaughter used in these communities (shechita in the Jewish community, dhabiha in the Islamic community; the two are closely related but not identical) involves cutting the throat of the animal with a sharp knife, which proponents claim is as painless as, if not better than, slaughter with stunning. Because surplus meat is often sold to the general market, this meat ends up in general distribution.

Some countries specifically allow religious slaughter – in the US, the Humane Slaughter Act specifies that ritual slaughter is considered humane. [6] Many countries already have a ban on religious slaughter, such as Sweden and Switzerland, while others are considering one, such as New Zealand. In these countries, religious communities are forced to import meat from abroad, which can be very expensive (and, for some kinds of meat, not practical).
