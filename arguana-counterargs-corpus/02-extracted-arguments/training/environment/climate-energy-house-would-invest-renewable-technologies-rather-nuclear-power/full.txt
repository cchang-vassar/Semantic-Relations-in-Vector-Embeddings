# THESIS
This House Would Invest in Renewable Technologies rather than Nuclear Power


# INTRO
The suggestion that nuclear power is a ‘green’ source of energy has long been a divisive issue for the environmental lobby. Some have seen nuclear energy as environmentally unfriendly, others as a necessary evil and another group have suggested that it is the best answer to a carbon-neutral future. Some environmentalists have suggested that nuclear power should be treated as a one way bridge – filling the gap while more sustainable technologies are developed. On the other hand it has suggested that renewables will never meet the energy needs of developed societies and that nuclear power is the only way of addressing those concerns in an age that is increasingly concerned about carbon emissions.

There are problems with all forms of non-carbon intensive energy production and inevitable arguments between them. Some relate to security of supply, others to the environmental impact of the restive technologies. The variations in the assertions of the defenders and critics of all of the technologies are breath-taking. Generally speaking, however, the confusion stems from issues relating to the externalities of the sources. “Externalities” is a term used by economists – and others who are interested – to refer to unseen costs. Critics of nuclear power say that their costs tend to ignore the costs of reprocessing and the damage caused by mining. Likewise critics of tidal power question the additional costs that should be factored in as a result of barrages on local fisheries.

With the emergence of new powers such as China – which currently has 14 nuclear power stations with another 25 under construction [i] - there are concerns as to how these developments may affect the relationships between high energy using states. In addition there is a concern about the impact that a transition to non-carbon based fuels will have on the relationships those states have with the Middle East.

The issue is constantly in flux in the minds of many commentators. The British columnist and environmental campaigner George Monbiot, who previously described himself as “agnostic” on the issue of nuclear power, was converted by, of all things, the meltdown at the Fukushima plant in Japan [ii] .

The primary difficulty faced by Proposition in this debate is that supporters of renewables – even those who can group together against nuclear and fossil fuel based technologies – can rarely agree on which of the available renewable technologies should be supported. In practical terms this leaves Proposition needing to defend a variety of technologies against specific attacks on each of them. Opposition, by contrast, needs to deal with the presumption that anything with the world ‘nuclear’ in it is dangerous; the words and phrases Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island are too easily brought to mind and associated with words such as meltdown, Armageddon and warfare.

# PRO01A-POINT
The nuclear industry has constantly required government bailouts and has never been commercially viable in an open market

The nuclear industry is always keen to point out how cheap it is to produce a therm of energy through splitting an atom. However, these figures tend to leave out a few details such as the decade of taxpayer’s dollars it takes to build a nuclear plant in the first place or the 20,000 years it takes to reprocess the fuel rods afterwards.

In every nation with a civil nuclear industry, the tax payer has been paying through the nose to keep it running. Even with all of this support, the price of nuclear industry is still not competitive. In the US alone the bill is running at over $150m in hard cash [i] , when British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) had to start facing up to the costs of reprocessing its spent fuel in 2001, the British government was required to underwrite the cost of 2.1 billion pounds in that year with an anticipation of ten times that during the forthcoming years. The alternative would have been bankruptcy for the entire industry [ii] .

# PRO01B-COUNTER
The costs of protecting oil supplies are significantly than any externalities created by the nuclear industry. In addition to which most sectors of the renewables industry have yet to even turn a dollar. Solar power, for example would have to compensate the enormous quantities of land it takes up to even cover its own costs [i] .

Of course there are externalities in the production of nuclear power, as there are in any other industry – especially the energy sector. If the oil industry had to carry the cost of wars in the Middle East or the reparations due for climate change it would be bankrupt tomorrow. If tidal power providers had to pay for the long term damage to coastlands, no-one would even think about floating a barrage.

By any standards nuclear is relatively cheaper and runs a much cleaner ship than most parts of the sector.

# PRO02A-POINT
The nuclear industry is constantly judged on criteria that do not take its externalities into account

Nuclear puts great store on the fact that it is a ‘clean fuel’ however this assessment tends to ignore several factors in terms of social and other costs. Although much attention has been given to the possible harm of dealing with fuel rods at the end of their life, much less is given to the mining of Uranium in the first place. To take one of many examples, in 2006 the Navajo nation won a lengthy legal fight to prevent Uranium mining ever taking place on their land. Similar efforts by communities in Latin America have been less successful.

The industry bears none of the costs for the illnesses, poisoned rivers, fatalities and other costs of this process [i] .

# PRO02B-COUNTER
The nuclear industry around the world has always sought to improve the rights and protections of workers in uranium mines and to lessen the environmental impact of those mining activities [i] .

Compared to the environmental impact of coal and oil withdrawal, uranium is relatively harmless.

Compared to the space taken up by windfarms with their impact on the local environment and the devastation that can be caused by Hydroelectric, this is a low impact industry.

# PRO03A-POINT
It is simply unethical to invest in an industry that will leave the problems it creates to be dealt with for thousands of years into the future

Were humankind to stop all nuclear energy use tomorrow we, as a species, would have to deal with the repercussions of nuclear power for four times longer than human civilization has so far existed. Polluting our own age is one thing but to bequeath such a heritage to generations as yet unimagined let alone unborn. To give this some context, in the case of just one isotope, plutonium 239 – the most poisonous substance known to mankind – had the Ancient Egyptians used this as an energy source to build the pyramids we would still be dealing with it today and it would still have 235,000 years to go.

# PRO03B-COUNTER
All societies inherit problems from previous generations this age has acquired a global population that has increased seven-fold in the course of two generations and has a desperate need for energy. Nuclear power fills that need and consistently works to ensure that its byproducts are rendered harmless.

No industry has put more work into ensuring that it does not leave a mess behind it – nor is any industry under more scrutiny on the subject.

The Nuclear Industry has routinely accepted its responsibility to future generations in a way that other sectors of the mainstream energy sector have refused to.


# CON01A-POINT
There is no instance in which renewable energy has been able to provide a major share in the energy market

Despite the best intentions of major players in the energy market, renewable fuels have simply not been able to keep up with demand. It has a limited role in supplying electricity and virtually none in any other area.

Although Nuclear is poor in the provision of non-electrical energy as well it has proved a more consistent form of energy in every arena than renewables. It has proved to be cleaner than any form of fossil fuels. With technological advances it is the obvious fuel of the future and, as a result deserves further funding and research.

# CON01B-COUNTER
Nuclear power has, worldwide, received billions, if not trillions, of dollars of investment. By comparison the renewables industry has received tiny grants from central government and, despite a lack of funding and running forty years behind in terms of the attention of governments, it is holding its own with an expanding market share. As of the 8th of July 2011 the US was more reliant on renewable energy than nuclear [i] according to the Energy Information Administration.

All of this was accomplished despite massively disproportionate funding. According to the primary Congressional report on the subject:

“Energy research and development (R&amp;D) intended to advance technology played an important role in the successful outcome of World War II. In the post-war era, the federal government conducted R&amp;D on fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources to support peacetime economic growth. The energy crises of the 1970s spurred the government to broaden the focus to include renewable energy and energy efficiency. Over the 33-year period from the Department of Energy’s inception at the beginning of fiscal Year (FY) 1978 through FY2010, federal spending for renewable energy R&amp;D amounted to about 16% of the energy R&amp;D total, compared with 14% for energy efficiency, 26% for fossil, and 37% for nuclear. For the 63-year period from 1948 through 2010, nearly 12% went to renewables, compared with 9% for efficiency, 25% for fossil, and 50% for nuclear.” [ii] Put simply the renewables industry has been outspent but is still producing more energy in the world’s largest consumer.

# CON02A-POINT
Renewables are mostly unproven, experimental technologies being developed on a small-scale basis that is not ready to take up the gap to move away from fossil fuels under climate change agreements

The renewable sector is a rapidly changing market moving in between micro-renewables and massive offshore projects. It is a fascinating area as an emergent technology field but it lacks stability both in terms of technology and investment.

Realistically nuclear power is going to have to play an important role in bridging the gap – at the very least – on the road away from a carbon dependent economy [i] .

The technology and funding is simply not in place for any renewable technology to take up the hard lifting from oil and coal yet.

[i] G Paschal Zachary. “The Case for Nuclear Power”. SFGate (San Fransisco Chronicle). 5 February 2006.

# CON02B-COUNTER
It is useful to deal with the idea that nuclear is a CO2 free fuel. When the entire fuel cycle is considered then Nuclear power is a direct contributor to climate change emissions [i] .

It is then possible to add in additional carbon footprints such as the emissions caused by building and staffing a large plant.

It is also a question worth asking as to when climate change-related pollution became the only standard. There are plenty of other ways of polluting the environment and belching out irradiated gases into the ocean would seem to meet that standard.

# CON03A-POINT
Nuclear power has a proven track record in France, Canada and Russia and an increasing role in new energy markets

There are already stable markets for nuclear power around the world with plants providing a consistent share of energy to the consumer. Although there are now renewable suppliers providing some share of total demand it is rare for them to have established relationships with either suppliers or major industrial consumers.

There are, however established models of how nuclear power can be blended into an integrated energy supply system.

# CON03B-COUNTER
It is interesting to note that the only places where nuclear energy has provided a dominant share of the national energy market are France, Russia, Canada (specifically Ontario) and now, increasingly China. All of which have heavily centralised energy markets.

Indeed the correlation between bureaucracy, the possession or desire for a nuclear arsenal and the use of overpriced nuclear energy appears to go beyond coincidence.
