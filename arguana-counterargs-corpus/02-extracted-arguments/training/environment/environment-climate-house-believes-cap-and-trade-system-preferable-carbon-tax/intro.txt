It is generally agreed among most academics, and is generally assumed during BP and Worlds format debates, that global warming exists as a phenomenon. Further, it is generally agreed that carbon emissions have something to do with global warming.

Corporations and businesses tend to be the largest individual producers of carbon emissions. Although households may use more collectively, the processes of manufacturing and power generation create vastly more loose carbon than the functions of a single home.

In the past few years many capitalist liberal democratic nations have been studying different methods of preventing corporations from emitting too much carbon. The first type is a normal tax. This method simply taxes corporations in proportion to the amount of carbon that they emit. The second is a more complicated system where a nation creates a carbon “cap” or a limit on the amount of carbon it is willing to allow firms to emit. The government then requires that firms hold permits, or “carbon credits” equivalent to their emissions. The number of credits given out by the government cannot exceed the cap. Firms that need to increase their emissions must thusly buy carbon credits from those firms that do not need as many permits. Thus a market is created for carbon credits, which allows the government to regulate the amount of carbon emitted by each firm at ideally, the lowest possible cost to society.

Whether a carbon credit system actually works to the extent that the theory above suggests, however, is something that is up for debate. Practically the debate can come down to a discussion of cap and trade only, however, it is likely the best option for opposition to use carbon taxes as a counterprop or a viable alternative.
