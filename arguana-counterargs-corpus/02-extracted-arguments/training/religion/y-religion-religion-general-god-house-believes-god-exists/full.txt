# THESIS
This House believes that God exists


# INTRO
The question of God’s existence forms a fundamental part of theology, philosophy, and life generally. Religion is one of the most profound and pervasive institutions, appearing in virtually every culture and in every time. Serious questioning of the existence of God has only become part of common discourse in the past three centuries, however, as state-sponsored religion and religious crimes have faded from the Western world. Increasing scientific knowledge has also led people to question belief in the existence of God. Since there are many arguments on both sides of the debate about God’s existence, it is necessary to limit the focus of this discussion. This debate will therefore take place largely within the parameters of the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and will focus on the arguments for and against the Abrahamic conception of God.
