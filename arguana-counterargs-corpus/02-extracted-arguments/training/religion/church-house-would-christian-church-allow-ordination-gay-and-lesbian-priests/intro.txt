This is a debate about the Christian church, and a proposition that utterly discounts the authority of the Bible is rather missing the point. There is a genuine debate within the church about whether gay men and women can be true representatives of God on earth. Generally, the attitude of church authorities is “don’t ask, don’t tell” or more firmly against gays and gay priests; a notable case in August 1999 saw the Rev. Robert Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick, who had ministered to gay and lesbian Catholics for many years, summoned to the Vatican and ordered to stop their work. [1] More recently, there have been controversies over the appointment in New Hampshire of Gene Robinson as the Anglican communion's first gay bishop, which threatened schism within the Anglican Communion, [2] and over the attempted appointment of Geoffrey John as a bishop in England, where John was first appointed Bishop of Reading and then forced by the Archbishop of Canterbury to stand down and has since been prevented from becoming bishop of Southwark. [3] In 2009 the Church of Scotland was also split over the appointment of an openly gay minister, Scott Rennie, in Aberdeen where the church ultimately decided to lift its ban on gay priests. [4]

The Church of England has however been changing its position since the rejection of Geoffrey John in order not to be on the wrong side of the Equality Act 2010, in the Churches legal advice it is conceded that "A person's sexual orientation is in itself irrelevant to their suitability for episcopal office or indeed ordained ministry" but appointment can be prevented if it would cause division. [5]

The proponents of gay rights inevitably face a tougher time inside the Church, where they face a vociferous opposition, than in society as a whole where political correctness has made such outspoken criticism less common.

With the recently announced proposal to legalise Gay Marriage in the UK and an ongoing review into the Anglican Church’s position on Civil Partnerships this is an issue is great contemporary significance.
