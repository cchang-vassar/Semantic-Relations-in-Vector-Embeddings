Marriage is an institution that has existed in most societies around the world for an incredibly long time. It is, traditionally, the union between a man and woman in both a religious and a legal sense. Marriage offers a stable relationship that is recognised by the state and by whatever religion the couple choose to follow, as well as providing a good environment in which to raise children. However, with ever rising amounts of premarital cohabitation, single parent families and children born outside of wedlock, as well as the decline in adherence to religion, it seems that the institution is losing much of its appeal. In this debate, the proposition must prove that the institution of marriage has ceased to have relevance to modern society.
