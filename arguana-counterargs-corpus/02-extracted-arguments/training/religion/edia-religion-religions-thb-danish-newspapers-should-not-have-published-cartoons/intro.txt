In September 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten posted a series of cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Mohammed, sometimes in ways associating Mohammed with terrorism or extremist Islam. While the content of the images were offensive in themselves the offense is made much worse as graphic depictions of Mohammed are not permitted in Islam. The editors of the newspaper explained that their publishing the cartoons was an act of protest against Islamic demands for self-censorship, feeling that those values were incompatible with western liberal democracy. These cartoons were subsequently reprinted by other newspapers in Europe, often in reaction to the protests against the cartoons.

Public protests erupted among Muslims in Denmark and Europe, and were soon followed by protests and violence in the Middle East, including attacks on the Danish embassies in Iran, Syria, Indonesia, and Lebanon. The European Union noted its disapproval of the publication. Death threats against the cartoonists and editors were issued by various Islamic leaders, eventually causing the newspaper’s editors to apologize and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh to issue a statement of regret and apology.

It is unlikely that the exact same circumstances will recur, so debates on this issue will either be in the past – as this is set out, or will be drawing upon the issue to provide examples and understanding of what may happen in similar circumstances.
