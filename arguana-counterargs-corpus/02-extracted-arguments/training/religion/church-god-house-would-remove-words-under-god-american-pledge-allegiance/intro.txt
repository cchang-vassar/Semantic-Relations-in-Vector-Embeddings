The American Pledge of Allegiance is an officially sanctioned recital of words swearing loyalty to the United States of America. School children are required to recite the Pledge before school every day. Importantly, one of the lines of the Pledge is “one nation under God.” The words “under God” were not in the original Pledge (1892) but were added in 1954 in reference to a speech by Abraham Lincoln. In this debate, the proposition wish to have the words “under God” officially removed from the Pledge altogether. ‘This House’ can be assumed to refer to the United States congress as only they would have the power to make this change.
