Creationism, often rebranded as Intelligent Design, is the belief that intelligent agency was involved in the creation and development of life on Earth. The view purports to be a science and to be deserving of consideration not only by the scientific community, but also students. For this reason Creationists have been involved in raising public awareness about the flaws they see in evolution, and have created major controversies, and it has become a particular issue in the United States. In Britain, schools must teach evolution as part of the National Curriculum, but are not barred from teaching creationism as well, and some religious schools, such as Emmanuel College in Gateshead, have done so, presenting creationism as fact and evolution as a matter of faith. In the USA, pressure has been put on school boards to enforce the teaching of creationism and evolution as equally controversial scientific theories (as in Ohio), or to remove evolution from the list of examination topics and therefore make it less likely to be taught (as in Kansas). While Creationists have found mixed success in the furtherance of their views on the political stage they have met with far stauncher and more unified opposition from the scientific community, which has largely denounced Creationism as religion in the borrowed clothes of science. The controversy remains in spite of this denunciation. Debates on teaching Creationism in school revolve around the questions of whether Creationism can be considered a legitimate scientific position, and whether it stands up to empirical scrutiny.

Important note: In any debate regarding evolution, abiogenesis, and Creationism, it is important to work out from the start what is under discussion. Creationists in particular use ambiguity to their advantage in debates. For example, if the debate is on evolution, should he feel cornered, a Creationist will often try to turn the conversation to the question of the origin of life, or of the planet. Sometimes they will go so far as to ask for an explanation of the beginning of the Universe. While all these do have scientific explanations, they have nothing whatsoever to do with evolution. Debates should always be kept on topic or else they have a strong tendency to get very messy indeed.

Useful Definitions.

- Scientific Theory: "A systematic ideational structure of broad scope, conceived by the human imagination, that encompasses a family of empirical (experiential) laws regarding regularities existing in objects and events, both observed and posited. A scientific theory is a structure suggested by these laws and is devised to explain them in a scientifically rational manner." [1]

-Evolution: "The biological theory that animals and plants have their origin in other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences are due to modifications in successive generations." [2]

-Abiogenesis: "The field of science dedicated to studying how life might have arisen for the first time on the primordial young Earth." [3]
