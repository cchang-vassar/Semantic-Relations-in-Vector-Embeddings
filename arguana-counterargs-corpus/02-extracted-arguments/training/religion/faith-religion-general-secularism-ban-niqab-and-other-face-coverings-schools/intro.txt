The issue of religious-inspired face coverings worn by some Muslim women has caused controversy in many countries in Europe. For some people, these face coverings symbolise repression and a regressive attitude to women. For those who choose to wear it, it symbolises the defence of women’s modesty against the assault of modern society, and is a statement of identity. Islamic inspired clothing for women can take several forms, from simple headscarfs to items such as the full burqa, which covers all of the body, with the woman able to see out through a grille-like part at the front.

This issue has been controversial in various countries for nearly a decade. In 2004, France introduced a law which banned all visible religious symbols in schools. Two years later, the issue of religious and cultural flexibility in school uniforms came to be heard by the top court in the United Kingdom [1] . A pupil insisted on wearing the jilbab, a long and lose coat which does not cover the face to a school which already had some choice, in that it allowed a loose fitting trouser outfit known as the shalwar kameez. She claimed that she needed to wear the jilbab due to her (or her family’s) interpretation of Islamic dress, and refused to attend school as long as she was not allowed to wear a jilbab. She brought legal action against the school. The top court in the United Kingdom ruled that there was no breach of her right to manifest her religion, and that even if there was, it was justified. [2]

The issue of face coverings in schools has also been debated as to whether it is appropriate for teachers to wear them [3] . The issue has also been brought to prominence in cases that are the other way around with allegations that teachers in a state school were forced as part of their job to wear the niqab, a full face veil that covers the entire face other than the eyes [4] .

Where should schools draw the line on religious and cultural clothing – and what side of the line do veils fall on?

N.B. This is a modified junior version of the slightly broader Debatabase debate ‘ This House would ban religious symbols in public buildings ’, for people who are in school. The original provides more detailed explanations.
