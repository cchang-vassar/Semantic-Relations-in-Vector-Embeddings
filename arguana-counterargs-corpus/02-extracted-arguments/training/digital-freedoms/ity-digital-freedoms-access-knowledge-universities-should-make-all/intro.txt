Universities produce an immense amount of information. For their students academics write lecture notes, create course guides, and put together bibliographies. They may well also record their lectures and any events they take part in. But teaching is not all that academics do. They often have to write a certain number of journal articles per year and university funding is often in large part based upon the amount and quality of the research done by the institution. A large part of their output is therefore is large quantities of research often funded by the state. Importantly academic publishers pay nothing for the journal articles they publish. Yet the final journal articles when they are published individually online often cost more than $30, and considerably more than that for the whole journal or for it in physical form. [1] Academic books are similarly expensive, sometimes costing over $100.

High costs for access to academic work used to make sense as unlike publishing for the broad consumer market publishers would only sell a few hundred copies. Small print runs meant that each individual book was expensive to produce. Today however much of the cost can be taken out of the system through publishing online; there is no need for the physical manufacturing of books and journal articles as they can simply be put on the internet. This not only reduces the overall cost but makes the marginal cost of providing access almost nothing.

While it is perhaps still the norm for access to knowledge to be kept private to universities and journals to be behind paywalls this is now rapidly beginning to change. Open access has been growing rapidly despite opposition from publishers from around 20,000 articles in 2000 to 350,000 today. [2] Around 30% of peer reviewed journals are already open access and governments are working to increase this number. The Research Councils UK (the main pathway for government funding for research in the UK) will, from April 2013, only fund research if it will be available to the public. [3] The European Union is to follow suit and aim “for 60% of European publicly-funded research articles to be available under open access by 2016.” [4] Courses are being opened up in the same way, universities found that they could not sell their course materials online, but many decided instead to put some of their online courseware online for free. This includes some of the most prestigious universities such as MIT, Yale, and Berkley. [5]

In this instance by available to the general public we don’t just mean that they are available when a member of the public goes into the university and asks for the materials but that they are actively made available; such as being published on the internet.

Asking for all academic work seems to imply that essentially all work that everyone involved in the university undertakes should be available to the general public. However this may be going a bit far; making every essay by every student available would potentially make it difficult to set similar questions in the future by encouraging plagiarism. More questionable would be whether books should be included or excluded. For the proposition there are not many advantages to including books while creating the disadvantage that it would practically eliminate the incentive to publish books on academic issues. Another area that could conceivably be included would be whole online courses that allow for remote learning towards receiving a qualification; the arguments for and against this however while they overlap are different. For this debate I am therefore focusing on academic journals and course materials.
