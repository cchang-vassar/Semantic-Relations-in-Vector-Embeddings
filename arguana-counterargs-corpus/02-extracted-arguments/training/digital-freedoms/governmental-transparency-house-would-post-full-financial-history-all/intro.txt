Politicians come under intense scrutiny when they seek public office. When they put their names forward they open themselves up to public questioning about their personal lives, and who they are as individuals, what motivates them, all in hopes of understanding how they will act in office.

One of the core aspects of politicians’ and indeed everyone’s, life is their financial dealings. Yet there is a great deal of opacity in this regard, as financial records are confidential. Thus people have usually been unable to gain a firm understanding of what their leaders’ financial backgrounds are like except by second-hand evidence. While most countries have financial disclosure systems, few of them, only 36%, actually check this disclosure for inconsistencies. Only 43% of countries make these disclosures public so open to the scrutiny of the electorate and media. And this is only for assets and interests while in office, it does not cover the financial history of the candidate so does not provide a full record. [1]

The desire of citizens to make the best, most informed decisions has led many to call for politicians to disclose their financial records. In the past US presidential election Mitt Romney came under a great deal of public pressure until he disclosed his tax returns. The legal requirement for disclosure in the United States is quite sparse with one form disclosing personal fortune. But this is not the full financial history, Obama had tax returns released all the way back to 2000. [2] When he did release full tax returns he only did so for 2011 and 2010 and questions still remained. As a result of the attacks by the Obama campaign the issue of financial disclosure may well have had an impact on votes in the election. [3]

Should Romney have been pressured into revealing these private details? Do they have an impact on the quality of decision-making citizens will have? This debate seeks to explore these questions.
