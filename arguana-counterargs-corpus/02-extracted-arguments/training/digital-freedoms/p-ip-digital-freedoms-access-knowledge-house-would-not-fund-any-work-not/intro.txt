A creative commons license is a kind of copyright license that gives people the right to use, share, and expand upon a creator’s work whether this is an art work, a piece of literature, or a scientific or academic material. [1] It offers a significant protection against accusations of copyright infringement and is believed by some to offer artists flexibility they may desire. However it also erodes artists’ control of their work because it can be reused without permission meaning it may be used in contexts which the original creator may not have envisaged or approve of. [2]

Attendant in all this is the additional issue of how the government should license work that it commissions. Work for government is almost by definition being carried out for the people in one form or another so should all work done by government have a creative commons license and therefore be open to those people? The state engages in a lot of work that is licensed; it funds art, and culture (usually only in part) but the state also funds scientific and academic research, the creation of large amounts of software, the creation of large data resources, the development of weapons systems, for all creative commons licencing could apply but in some cases it may not be wise to do so.

Some governments, such as the United States already go part way towards making work they fund available to the public. Any “government [that] work is prepared by an officer or employee of the United States government as part of that person's official duties” is in the public domain. Which means they are similarly open to reuse and reproduction as if they were creative commons. [3] However it is notable that this does not apply to works produced by government contractors or by institutions that are largely or fully funded by government such as the Smithsonian which this motion includes.
