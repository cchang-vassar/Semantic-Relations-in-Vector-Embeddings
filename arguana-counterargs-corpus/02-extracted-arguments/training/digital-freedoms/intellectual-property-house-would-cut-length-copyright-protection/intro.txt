Copyright is a legal right furnished by governments that provide the creators of new and original works with the exclusive right of use and sale of those works. It protects a wide range of artistic works from literature and dramatic works, to art, music and recordings. [1] This protection usually lasts for a limited length of time. The length of time varies from place to place, but in most jurisdictions it extends for the length of the artist’s life plus fifty years. [2] This proposal would mean significantly cutting the length of copyright significantly to a point where it lasts less than an individual’s lifetime.

The balancing act between the rights of artists over their work and that of the public to enjoy, consume, learn from, and adapt to that art is one hotly debated across the world. Intellectual property law provides for significant copyright protection, often extending after an artist’s death for decades. Few people disagree that artists should have some control over their work and that they should be able to profit from their output. The question is how long that protection should last. This debate will outline the main arguments for shortening copyright protection and freeing art for the people, and those for preserving the current laws so that the artists may profit fully from their labours.
