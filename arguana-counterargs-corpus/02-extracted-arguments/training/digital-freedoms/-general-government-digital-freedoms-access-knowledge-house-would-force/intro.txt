Think tanks are a modern phenomenon, where high profiling intellectuals are given a free role to discover, investigate and solve important issues in order to affect public policy. The purpose of a think tank is to provide expert advice and ideas on economic or political problems; usually a think tank has a particular area of expertise and focuses their study on that area. Their purpose is then not to propagate a political agenda but to look at facts, ideas, and possible new policies. In practice however this results in particular think tanks promoting policies that have a particular political orientation.

Despite the political leanings of some think tanks are often elevated to a status of impartial enlightenment and their voice has great impact on the paradigm and on public discourse. They publish academic material, hold seminars, and appear as authorities on particular areas in the media. [1] However, lately, voices are being raised calling for their increased transparency on their sources of funding. Of particular note the EU Administration and Anti-Fraud Commissioner Siim Kallas argued that as think tanks play a clear role in EU policymaking they should sign up to the European Commission's voluntary lobbyists register. [2] This would not require complete details of their funding but would require they “declare the interests, objectives or aims promoted and, where applicable, specify the clients or members whom they represent”. [3]

The model for think tanks disclosing their funders would require organisations to make public all contributions that constitute a significant portion of the organisations’ budget. This can take the form of a percentage, e.g. 1% of their budget. This would make them unable to receive anonymous donations over this sum. The major funders would then have to be disclosed along with any research they funded and would be on the think tank’s website.
