The internet is increasingly seen as a potential battleground of the future, while there would be few casualties in such warfare it would have an impact on the real world. While the Director of National Intelligence has poured cold water over the idea that there might be a ‘digital Pearl Harbour’ in the next few years the possibility that cyber-attacks could knock out the U.S. electric grid has been recognised. [1] The United States military has gone so far as to suggest that they would consider military action in response to such acts with one military official suggesting “If you shut down our power grid, maybe we will put a missile down one of your smokestacks.” [2] There have even been suggestions from the Defense Service Board that in the case of the biggest possible cyber-attacks the United States could not rule out a nuclear response. [3]

As yet however there have been no cases of cyber warfare but there have been increasing problems with cyber-attacks in a peace time situation; companies such as the New York Times and Google have been hacked, [4] a virus called Stuxnet put back Iran’s nuclear program, and most of Estonia’s internet was reduced to a crawl in 2007 as a result of a distributed denial of Service (DDoS) attack. [5] David Rothkopf has suggested that cyber-attacks will result in a ‘cool war’ in which there is little military action but persistent tension as a result of minor actions such as cyber-attacks he says “The purpose of Cool War is to be able to strike out constantly without triggering hot war while also making hot wars less desirable (much as did nuclear technology during Cold War days) or even necessary.” [6] If this becomes the case then the internet will surely be where this mostly happens. This makes it important that there is some formal way of responding to cyber-attacks that does not involve military action as the next step in escalation. Instead there needs to be a mechanism to resolve disputes and penalise the offender.

Fortunately at the same time as the US suggested the military option would not be off the table it accepted it would be a last resort and diplomatic, informational, and economic would come first “as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law”. [7]

So what are cyber-attacks and the proposed targeted sanctions?

NATO defines cyber attacks to be ‘a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects’ [8] this is useful for defining what attacks might be just cause for a military response but this is a very high bar at the moment as few attacks cause immediate physical damage. Sanctions could be used in response to much lower level attacks. Businesses in particular would be keen to have the government help prevent the stealing of intellectual property through the imposition of sanctions. So we would simply be imposing sanctions when the economic losses are quantifiable and sufficient to be worth government effort to prevent.

Sanctions are the use of economic pressure by a state (or group) of states in an attempt to get another state to change a policy. The pressure is either through direct economic pain on the actor launching the attacks or to encourage public pressure. [9] In this case sanctions would be either attempting to prevent a state from launching cyber attacks of its own or to persuade it to crack down on non-state actors that are launching these attacks.
