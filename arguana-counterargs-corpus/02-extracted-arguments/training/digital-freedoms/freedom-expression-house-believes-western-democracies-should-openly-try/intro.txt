Internet censorship has been growing precipitously in countries around the world. Freedom House finds that 20 of 47 countries examined have increased their restrictions on internet freedom in 2011 and 2012 against only 14 with increasing freedom. [1] At the same time the methods of control have been becoming more restrictive. Oppressive regimes, here defined as governments that are anti-democratic, that do not afford general civil rights to their citizens, and that do not have a robust respect for the rule of law, have made particular use of new technologies to limit access to parts of the internet.

The role of private firms in this process has come under a great deal of scrutiny. The European Parliament introduced rules to restrict the export of equipment that could be used to censor the internet after it was found that European businesses were providing the technology to Middle Eastern Autocrats. Gamma Group from England supplied Mubarak with a monitoring system, Amesys did the same with Gaddafi, while SpA, an Italian company gave a system to Syria to “intercept, scan and catalog virtually every e-mail that flows through the country”. [2] Some internet service providers and search engines have also been happy to adopt the stringent laws of autocratic countries, aiding in their censorship of the internet. Google is an example of a company that for a while was happy to comply with China’s rules on Search before pulling out in January 2010. [3]

The appropriate response that Western democratic governments should adopt in response is a hotly debated. Europe attempting to restrict the sale of technology that the censors need is one way of reacting. This debate however focuses on the strategy of actively subverting the censorship policies of these regimes, [4] by enforcing business practices on their companies, by developing and distributing technologies that circumvent the censors, and by funding systems that can help break through the censors. These plans, their effectiveness, and their ethicalness will be discussed in detail.
