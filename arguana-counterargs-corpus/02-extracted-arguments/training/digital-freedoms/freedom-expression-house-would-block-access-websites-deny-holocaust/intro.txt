The Holocaust was one of the most terrible acts of mass slaughter the world has ever known. Historians around the world have reached a consensus as to what, broadly speaking, took place. The Nazi German regime led by Hitler systematically murdered 6,000,000 Jews, as well as countless Roma, Slavs, homosexuals, and dissidents. [1] Yet while the historical establishment is in agreement, a small fringe element of Holocaust deniers still exists in many countries around the world, with membership in some countries in the thousands. Because they are often curtailed in the public forum, by law in some cases and general social disgust in others, the internet has become the primary meeting place for Holocaust deniers, and their primary mode of promulgating their message. Holocaust denial is clearly a popular subject on the internet; it is the seventh most popular google search term related to the holocaust and a search returns millions of results. [2]

A debate is currently raging in many countries about whether giving a platform to these Holocaust deniers serves to strengthen their cause or to diminish it. For example, Holocaust denial has been illegal in Germany since 1985, and since 1994 there has been a maximum penalty of five years in jail for anyone who publically endorses, denies or downplays the holocaust. [3] In 2000 the federal supreme court ruled that German law banning holocaust denial material online should apply to material posted by foreigners who post content if the material is accessible in Germany. [4] France also has legislation dealing with holocaust denial with the 1990 Gayssot law and is attempting to expand it to cover other genocides such as the Armenian Genocide. [5] To show how far this can be taken in 2000 French citizens were barred from web sites that sold Nazi memorabilia. [6] Many universities have come down on either side of this debate, some allowing deniers to speak in their institutions, while other have adopted strict no-platform policies.

In all this debate sits the question of the role of the state in dealing with Holocaust denial as a phenomenon both of speech and act. This debate will examine the arguments of the proponents of bans on web access to Holocaust deniers, specifically that by denying Holocaust deniers access to websites, their primary mode of networking and organizing the state can serve to decrease the amount of discussion on this issue within society, as well as the opposition which argues that such a denial is a repudiation of the fundamental human rights of free speech and freedom of assembly, and that no matter how disgusting their rhetoric may be, the Holocaust deniers are still citizens and deserve to have their rights to speech, expression and assembly defended. Some on this side claim also that by giving them this platform they can be better confronted and brought low through debate and discourse.

The sides are vigorously opposed, with no solution to satisfy all in sight.
