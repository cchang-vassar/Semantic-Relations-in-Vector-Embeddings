Capital punishment is always controversial: for that reason, it is commonly used as a training debate. However, on the international level, its use in Africa is not a matter of debate as much as it is in the USA (the last Western highly developed democracy to maintain capital punishment), or Asian nations such as China, the country that performs more executions than the rest of the world put together. In general, the same fundamental arguments about penology (the social science of punishment) and criminology (the study of crime) apply worldwide - for that reason, this debate aims to avoid regurgitating the stock arguments and focus on the particular context of capital punishment in Africa. In 2012 [1] , executions were carried out in Sudan (including on opposition activists), South Sudan, Somalia, Botswana and The Gambia. Death sentences were also imposed in a number of other countries, including Egypt, DR Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

A particular example of a country that abolished capital punishment in Africa is South Africa. While there was a moratorium instituted in 1990 [2] , South Africa is the only country in Africa where capital punishment was abolished following the decision of a court (State v Makwanyane in 1995). The Makwanyane decision came in the years following the nation’s transition to democracy after the collapse of white minority rule, an era during which there were a number of executions for politically motivated offences, including that of anti-apartheid activists Frederick John Harris [3] and Vuyisile Mini. This position is despite South Africa having relatively high levels of violent crime, and significant levels of public support.

Most recently Benin abolished capital punishment in 2012 [4] , as did Burundi in 2009 [5] . However, The Gambia has moved towards a different direction. In 2012, The Gambia carried out nine executions; it’s first since 1985 [6] , following a “promise” to execute just under fifty convicts made by the president, Yahya Jammeh.
