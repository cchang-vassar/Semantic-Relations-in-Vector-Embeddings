Bullying has always been a problem for young people but it is only recently that bullying could be done over a long distance and potentially without knowing who the bully is. Bullying through the internet or phones, cyberbullying, has however with the spread of first the internet and then smartphones become as much of a problem and one that is harder to deal with then offline bullying. That harassment online can be a crime just like harassment offline is widely accepted but there is less consensus about what to do to punish extreme cases, especially when the perpetrator is under the age of 18 so is a young offender. Does sending them to jail, or a little more leniently a young offender’s institute fit the crime?

Some countries do have jail time as a potential punishment for cyberbullying; the UK enacted legislation in 2014 which included up to two years jail time for cyberbullying. [1] It is not the only country to do so, New Zealand, [2] Singapore, [3] Canada, and some US states (Maryland, Tennessee, and Wisconsin) [4] all also have the possibility of jail crime for cyberbullying. Many of these laws are recent and more are sure to follow which makes this punishment of cyberbullying an important debate to be had.

N.B. in this debate we will consider jail and young offenders institutes interchangeably. Ideally young offenders will be in an appropriate prison however this will vary from country to country.
