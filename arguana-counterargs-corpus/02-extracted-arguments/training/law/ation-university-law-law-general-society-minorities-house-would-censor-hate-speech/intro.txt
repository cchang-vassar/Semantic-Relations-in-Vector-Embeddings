Hate speech is a controversial issue in all Western Liberal Democracies (WLDs). What makes hate speech on university campuses a unique topic is the combination of public space, the historical role of universities as centres of free speech and expression, and the age and impressionability of students.

The definition of what constitutes hate speech is also controversial. For the purposes of the debate, proposition should set out a clear definition of hate speech as being the wilful promotion of hatred towards a group based on non-immutable personal characteristics. An immutable person characteristic includes a person’s race, gender, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation.

As far as a model goes, there are currently at least 390 American universities with campus speech codes (FIRE, “Spotlight on Speech Codes”). These codes are written by the school and so vary greatly from campus to campus. However, for this round it should be sufficient to argue that schools should have (or should be mandated to have) speech codes with meaningful enforcement mechanisms like expulsion and/or bans from entering the campus.
