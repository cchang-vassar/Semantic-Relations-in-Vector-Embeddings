At present police can remove samples of DNA from individuals suspected of involvement in a specified crime, commonly by the removal of cells from the mouth using a cheek swab. The DNA of the suspect can then be compared to any genetic material found at the scene of the crime; the DNA of each individual does not change during his lifetime. This technique is commonly used in police investigations and is termed 'DNA fingerprinting'. The creation of a database of DNA would allow police to use DNA in order to search for a suspect, rather than merely to provide evidence once a suspect has been apprehended. The British police have operated a database of the DNA of convicted criminals since 1995 - controversially, however, this includes DNA samples from all those arrested for a crime, even if they were later acquitted. As a result, the UK database now records of 4.5 million people on it; it has also recently been the subject of an adverse European Court of Human Rights judgement. Proponents of a DNA database argue that it would lead to more convictions and act as a deterrent, whilst opponents maintain that state knowledge of such sensitive information is a step too far and an affront to civil liberties.
