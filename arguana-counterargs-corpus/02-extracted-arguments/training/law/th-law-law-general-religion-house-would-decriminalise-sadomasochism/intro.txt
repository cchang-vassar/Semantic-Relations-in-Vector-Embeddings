Sadomasochism can be defined as the consensual infliction of physical pain for the purposes of sexual gratification [i] . The practice has received sensational media coverage following the separate deaths of the rock star Michael Hutchence [ii] and Stephen Milligan, a Conservative Member of the UK Parliament [iii] , whilst reportedly engaged in sadomasochistic practices. However, sadomasochism should not be regarded as the sole preserve of the disturbed and perverted. Recent commercial films such as David Cronenburg’s Crash, David Lynch’s Blue Velvet, Quills, a biopic of the Marquis De Sade, Secretary, [iv] 9 ½ weeks and the television show Buffy: The Vampire Slayer have devoted artistic attention to the practice. The popularity of fetishistic clothing amongst certain pop music performers, such as Rihanna, and nightclub clientele, indicate that sadomasochism might have mass-market credibility, if not participation [v] .

This debate raises the question of whether popular toleration of a practice should make it a legal one. The legality of the practice was considered by the highest judicial authority in the United Kingdom, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, in the case of R v Brown [vi] . By the narrowest possible majority it was held that a participant in sadomasochism could not legally consent to the commission of any injuries. The core of this debate concerns the moral arguments for individual liberty, privacy, and social protection. In order to avoid an arid technical dispute, it is suggested that the proposition model concern the legalization of sadomasochistic acts between consenting adults which do not lead to permanent injury or disablement
