Everyone talks about 'rights', 'human rights' and 'fundamental rights', but do they even exist? Can we ever really know what they are? Are they objective facts, or are they just products of our time and culture? What about competing ideas and definitions of human rights? Various attempts have been made to codify universal or fundamental human rights, but there exists no universally-followed list of rights. Our current conception of human rights has in one sense its origins in the conceptions of the 'Rights of Man' which emerged during the Enlightenment, but owes most of its current form and content to ideas which emerged in the wake of the Second World War, as embodied in the United Nations' 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, [1] which listed a large number of political, economic and social rights supposedly universally held by all people everywhere. This conception of human rights has been criticised, however, and the very idea of universal or fundamental human rights is by no means universally accepted by all nations and societies.
