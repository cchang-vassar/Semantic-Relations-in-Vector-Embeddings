The State of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina is formally divided into two entities the Republika Srpska [hereafter referred to as RS] (composed primarily of ethnic Serbs) and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina [FBH] (composed primarily of ethnic Croats and Bosnian Muslims or Bosniaks). This division dates from the time of its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 during the Yugoslav wars and was designed to end the fighting and promote peace and reconciliation. The conflict was ended by the Dayton Agreement of 21st November 1995. The agreement set an inter-ethnic boundary line which closely followed the front lines at the end of the war with a few adjustments particularly in the case of Sarajevo. [1] These two entities are largely self-governing within their own territories, with their own parliaments, presidents, constitutions, [2] police forces and even their own postal systems [3] . Cooperation between the two parts within federal state structures is limited and characterised by gridlock and division. Many within the Republika Srpska seek independence from Bosnia-Herzegovina and potentially even union with Serbia.
