In an age of technology, more and more information can be gathered from an individual for security measures, for example for fingerprint [1] or iris [2] checks at airport security. While the intention of this may be to increase security across nations [3] , some people have begun to question how much of their personal information is really needed by government organisations, and whether their liberty is as risk [4] . While the standards of identity cards may vary from country to country, nations such as the UK [5] , Canada [6] , the USA [7] , France [8] and Australia [9] have all debated implementing a system of biometric identity cards. In this case, each citizen would have a card with their personalised data, such as a fingerprint [10] . However, this information may be expanded to include other information such as medical records [11] , and use of identity cards may ‘function creep’ [12] to an extent where it may eventually double as identification for an individual’s bank account or car ownership [13] , or even as a passport [14] . The technology is constantly growing and may some day incorporate many other aspects of ordinary, everyday life if this motion were to be implemented. It is fair to assume that, under the motion, an individual would be required to produce their identity card whenever requested by a figure of authority; for example a policeman or welfare officer.

While it is possible for the proposition to frame the debate around a standard identification card which does not necessarily feature biometric information, this is already status quo in countries such as Belgium, Germany and Portugal [15] . Arguably these examples could form a policy for the proposition side to propose. However, given that many people already carry a form of basic identification with their name on – such as a driver’s license or credit card – the debate would perhaps be broader, and bring more interesting points of discussion, if the proposition’s mechanism featured biometric identity cards. These are the source of much topical discussion and invoke arguments over privacy of information, the use and safety of biometric information by the government, and the true benefit to the cardholder.
