Mandatory sentences are prison terms that are set by the legislature and remove discretion from the judiciary. The usual practice is for legislatures to set maximum sentences for crimes and provide non-mandatory guidelines to be applied by judges. While the exact form of mandatory sentencing varies, commons forms include 3-strike laws and minimum sentences for a particular offense. Debaters may want to focus on a particular country when considering this debate, as the impact of mandatory sentencing varies depending on the country’s government structure and the nature of its crime problems. Mandatory sentences laws are often targeted at a particular form of crime For example, Australia’s Northern territory introduced minimum sentences for theft in 1997, while the British government has a minimum sentence of life imprisonment for murder (though this is coupled with a discretionary tariff). The following debate is not exclusive to the United States, but largely focuses on this nation, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. In the U.S. the most controversial mandatory minimums concern drug laws. Arguments in this debate may focus on the system of checks and balances between branches, as mandatory minimums shift power from the judiciary to the legislative and executive branches. Arguments may also focus on the impact on crime rates, as well as the impact on individuals sentenced under these restrictions. Debaters may also want to note that there are 4 generally accepted purposes to incarceration; rehabilitation (reforming the criminal), incapacitation (criminals cannot harm the public if they are in prison), deterrence (the threat of punishment prevents people from committing crime), and retribution (punishment gives a criminal their fair due). Debaters may wish to consider how mandatory sentencing impacts each of these factors of punishment.
