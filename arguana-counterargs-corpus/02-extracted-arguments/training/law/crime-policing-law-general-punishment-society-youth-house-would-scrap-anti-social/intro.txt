Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) were introduced in the UK by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and have been available in England and Wales since April 1999. They were ‘reinforced’ by the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003. The 1998 Act defines anti-social behaviour as behaviour that "caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household." They stop people from doing stated things or going to stated places. They last for a minimum of two years, but can last longer. Those given ASBOs can be ‘named and shamed’ in local media, and sometimes are. Orders have been granted for abusive behaviour, vandalism, flyposting, and harassment as well as more the more celebrated exotic problems such as elderly people incessantly playing gramophones.

Whilst ASBOs are civil orders and are made out according to the civil standard of ‘balance of probabilities’, criminal penalties may be incurred by their breach. Their existence therefore arguably blurs the lines that exist between the civil and criminal law.

The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in the UK announced in February 2011 that it wants to replace ASBOs with several different schemes such as Criminal Behaviour Orders, banning individuals from certain activities, Crime Prevention Injunctions, place specific orders preventing anti-social behaviour in that particular place, and Police ‘direction’ powers, where the police will be able to direct individuals away from a place. [1]

The law for replacing ASBOs is contained in the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill. A particular cause of controversy has been the first clause, which defines “anti-social behaviour” as something which may annoy someone [2] , which has been criticized as unduly broad [3] . These replacements would be known as IPNAs (injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance).
