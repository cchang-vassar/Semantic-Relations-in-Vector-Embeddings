Some modern states grant politicians outright immunity from prosecution. In such countries, including Albania, [1] Brazil [2] and to a lesser degree France [3] , politicians may not be subjected to criminal prosecution while they hold office. Other nations, such as the United States, have mechanisms of de facto immunity for politicians, by granting the head of the executive the uncontrolled power to issue pardons, effectively making any member of their cabinet immune. Many other nations give no such protections to the holders of political office, beyond protection from civil claims for remarks made while in parliament. [4]

The resolution is that politicians be granted a full and inviolate immunity from prosecution while serving.
