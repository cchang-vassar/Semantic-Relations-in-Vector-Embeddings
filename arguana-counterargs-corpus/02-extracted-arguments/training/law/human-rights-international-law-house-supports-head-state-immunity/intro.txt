Traditionally, heads of states, and other state officials, have enjoyed some form of immunity from prosecution. Immunity can be divided up in to two types – functional immunity, which is immunity for official actions, and personal immunity, which is attached to the individual. Head of state immunity typically falls under functional immunity. Personal immunity typically applies to individuals such as diplomats (Diplomatic immunity is outlined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations). This debate is focused on both of these forms of immunity when applied to political figures.

In 2002, the International Court of Justice, a UN body entirely unrelated to the International Criminal Court, confirmed the existence of state immunity [1] as a part of customary international law, in a case concerning a Belgian arrest warrant for the DR Congolese foreign minister, who was alleged to have incited genocide, which was issued under a Belgian universal jurisdiction law that allowed the Belgian courts to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, even if they are outside Belgium.

The issue was put to the test regarding the situation of the later life of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Following the ousting of democratically elected president Salvador Allende in a military coup Pinochet lead a military junta that, during his 27 year CIA backed [2] rule, committed a significant number of large scale human rights abuses [3] . Due to immunity that was created by the succeeding Chilean government, he was not prosecuted there; however he was indicted in Spain under universal jurisdiction in 1998 while he was in the United Kingdom for medical treatment.

The issue of head of state immunity lead to a battle over the possibility of his extradition in the British courts, going to its highest court three times – first on the issue of whether he was immune from prosecution in Spain [4] , secondly on an issue of bias [5] (one of the original judges, Leonard Hoffmann, had failed to disclose that he was an unpaid director of the charitable wing of Amnesty International [6] ), and a third, on the same issue as the first, after the unprecedented setting aside of the initial decision [7] . Eventually, the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords (a de facto court, rather than an arm of the legislature, since fully spun off in to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom) ruled that he did not have head of state immunity for some, but not all, of the charges, and allowed the Home Secretary to authorize his extradition. The original decision in Pinochet I was that torture cannot be a state function, negating functional head of state immunity. The decision in the third case was that he was not immune due to the torture convention, rather than anything in customary international law. Eventually Pinochet’s extradition was vetoed by Home Secretary Jack Straw, he returned to Chile, where he was indicted, but died before he could be tried.

International tribunals have typically rejected all forms of head of state immunity, Rome Statute Article 27 makes “official capacity” irrelevant in the work of the ICC, following on from similar positions in the ICTY and ICTR. These courts have repeatedly made determinations that state immunity does not apply at international tribunals, most recently done so by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, in the case of Charles Taylor [8] .

The issue of the trial of serving heads of state has resurfaced following the indictment of Uhuru Kenyatta, current president of Kenya, for his alleged role in violence after the 2007 election. Kenyatta, who was elected after the indictment, is still operating as president of Kenya (a fellow defendant in a separate trial, William Ruto, is Deputy President). This issue has been made more complex due to the shooting by al-Shabab linked gunmen at the Westgate shopping centre, with Kenyatta having to lead the response to the attacks while preparing to defend himself at the Hague [9] . Kenyatta’s trial is, at the time of writing, due to start on the 12 th of November 2013, but he will not need to be present for all of the trial [10] .
