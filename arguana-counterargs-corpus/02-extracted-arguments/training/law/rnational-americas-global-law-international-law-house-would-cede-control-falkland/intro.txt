The issue of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (with apologies to Argentinian readers, the English name is used for consistency on this page) is a dense and hotly contested one. This debate rather asks whether the UK should pass control to Argentina. While this naturally encompasses the legal arguments each side puts forwards for the primacy of their sovereignty claim, it needs to be recognised that that is not the centre of the debate – it might be fully conceded that the UK has the legal right to the islands and yet still be the conclusion that it should nevertheless pass control to Argentina.

The Falkland Islands are a British Overseas Territory in the south-west Atlantic Ocean. They are about 300 miles from Argentina and lie just above the Antarctic circle. Their population is about 3000 with an economy based upon agriculture; fishing; tourism; and oil exploration.

The Falkland Islands were discovered uninhabited by various European explorers in the 16 th and 17 th Centuries. The First European to sight the Islands was probably Amerigo Vespucci sailing under the Portuguese Flag. Magellan’s expedition may have sighted them but the first certain Spanish sighting was in 1540. [1] The first English sighting was by Captain John Davies in 1592, he was followed by Richard Hawkins and the Dutchman Sebald de Weert. [2] Britain claims Davies was the first person to see the Islands. The Argentines recognise De Weert’s sighting but reject those of Davis and Hawkins. [3] The British claim to discovery rests on Davis but it seems certain he was not the first to see them. [4] Captain John Strong of the Welfare may have been the first to actually land on the Islands in 1690 (depending on whether the 1540 Spanish expedition did). However it is claimed that this is ‘of no conceivable legal consequence.’ [5]

Since the question of sightings and discovery is so hard to pin down Argentina prefers to have its claim originate from the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 that divided the world between Spain and Portugal, the as yet undiscovered Falklands being on the Spanish side. [6] Naturally most other European powers did not recognise this. It is claimed that the return to Status quo ante by the Treaty of London (1604) England/Britain nullified all rights by discovery by Davis and Hawkins. [7] But a reader of the treaty will search in vain for any renunciation of such rights, only finding a confirmation that British ships could only trade where they were permitted before the war, i.e. not America. [8] Subsequent Spanish-British Treaties of Madrid (1670) and Utrecht (1713) confirmed this position that there were some areas where British merchants could not trade in America. [9]

That the first settlement was established in 1764 by the French on East Falkland is not disputed. [10] The French named them the ‘Iles Malouines’ of which ‘Islas Malvinas’ is a direct Spanish translation. The English named the passage between the two main islands the ‘Falkland Channel’ and thus the islands became ‘The Falklands’. In 1766 the British (unaware of the French presence) established a separate colony on the West Falkland. In the same year France agreed (under pressure) to transfer sovereignty over the Islands to Spain, and in 1767 the Spanish assumed control of the French colony. British and Spanish claims over the Islands thus arose simultaneously and independently.

The mutual discovery of each other’s settlements almost lead to war between Britain and Spain. With the order of the Spanish Governor Francisco Bucarelli to evict the British being interpreted in London as the start of a global challenge to British sea power. [11] The crisis was averted by Spanish restoration of the British colony, with the provision that Spain retained a competing claim to sovereignty over the islands. During the crisis however Lord North’s government conceded that it would be willing to abandon its claims and made a secret agreement ‘that did in effect amount to conceding Spanish Sovereignty’. [12]

In 1774 the British withdrew from the Falklands (as well as many other small overseas colonies) as a result of the crisis caused by American War of Independence). When pressed by the French to concede that this was done in accordance with the previous agreement North denied it. [13] A plaque was left on the Falklands asserting continued sovereignty. Spain continued its occupation until 1811, where due to similar pressure caused by the Napoleonic wars it was forced to withdraw, leaving a similar plaque. [14]

From 1811 to 1828 there was no official presence on the islands, though it was used as a refuge for damaged ships and as a staging area for British and American sealers.

In 1820 The United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata (the Argentinian proto-state) sent a Frigate under Colonel Daniel Jewitt to assert its sovereignty. He found various foreign, mostly US, ships there who met his assertion with scepticism, and then rejected it outright when Jewitt was arrested by the Portuguese for Piracy. [15]

In 1828 a German named Louis Vernet living in Buenos Aires was given a large part of the Islands on condition he established a colony which he proceeded to establish the following year. Having ignored Jewitts earlier claim the British consul now protested Vernet’s colonization. [16] It has been asserted that in 1820 Britain did not recognise the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata at all so a protest was superfluous. [17] Ironically many of his colonists were British, including his second in command Matthew Brisbane. In 1831 Vernet arrested three US ships for seal hunting. Since the United Provinces refused to avow that Vernet was their officer and take responsibility for the seizures the USS Lexington declared this to be piracy, sailed into Puerto Soledad and raised it to the ground. [18] At this point the US took the position that Spain had no right to the Falklands and by extension neither did Argentina, thus US citizens had a perfect right to seal hunting in the absence of the British. [19] The Lexington took Vernet’s colonists with it when it left, with only a couple who had fled at its approach remaining. [20] Argentina responded by sending 50 soldiers under Major Juan Esteban Mestivier to establish a penal colony, this failed because in December 1832 his soldiers mutinied and killed him. In 1833 the British Sloop Clio arrived to reassert their claim. Mestivier’s successor refused to take down the Argentine flag so the British took it down for him, the British action amounted to nothing more hostile than that. [21] Most Argentine accounts claim the Clio expelled the Argentine colony while glossing over the combined effect of the US attack and the mutiny having practically left no colony to expel. [22] Indeed British sources claim the exact opposite, the captain of the Clio, Onslow, expended considerable energy in persuading the Argentine survivors of Vernets colony to stay but was ultimately successful. [23] The Clio left William Dickson, one of Vernet’s original colonists in charge. Today the population of the Islands is virtually entirely of British descent.

For much of the 19th and 20th Centuries, Argentina and the United Kingdom enjoyed good cultural, trade and business relations (notwithstanding the sovereignty dispute). However the failure to reach a diplomatic agreement in the mid-twentieth century resulted in Argentina’s military junta launching an invasion of the islands in 1982; which was defeated after a major British military operation. Britain and Argentina restored diplomatic relations after Carlos Menem became President of a democratic Argentina in 1989. [24] Since 1990, South Atlantic issues have been discussed with the Argentine Government under a 'sovereignty umbrella' arrangement, which allows the UK and Argentina to protect their respective positions on sovereignty while seeking to make progress on practical matters of common interest such as fisheries and de-mining. [25]

There has been less cooperation since Nestor Kirchner became President of Argentina in 2003, he was followed in 2007 by his wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. For example, flights between Argentina and the islands have been stopped. Kirchner, supported by Hugo Chavez (President of Venezuela), demands that Britain return the islands. Many British commentators think that Kirchner has adopted his tough stance to gain domestic political support. Most recently there has been tension over the conducting of oil drilling tests by British companies in waters off the Falklands, with Argentina requiring permits for ships traveling to and from the Falklands and Argentina. [26]

Most of Latin America supports Argentina’s claim to the Falklands. During the Falklands War both France and the United States provided support to Britain, however the official position of the US government is that it is neutral in the dispute, as is that of Spain.

Each year the UN Special Committee on Decolonization hears representations from Argentina, the UK and the Falklands Islanders and typically passes a resolution calling for bilateral negotiations between the UK and Argentina. The position of the UK government is that it cannot enter into any negotiation over sovereignty without the consent of the Falklands Islanders. The position of the Argentinian government is that the Islanders are colonists and do not possess a right to self-determination; and that Argentina inherited Spain’s territorial claim on gaining independence.

Prior to the Falklands War there was serious exploration in negotiations of various ‘lease-back’ solutions which would protect the islander’s way of life while passing formal sovereignty to Argentina, however today the narrative on both sides considers Sovereignty as an absolute concept.
