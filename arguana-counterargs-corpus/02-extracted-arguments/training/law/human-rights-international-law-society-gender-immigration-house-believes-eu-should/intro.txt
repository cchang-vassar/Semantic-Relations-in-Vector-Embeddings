The right of asylum is a juridical concept, under which a person, in this case a woman, persecuted by her own government may be protected by another sovereign authority, a foreign country, or a union of countries.

Legislation is a law that has been enacted by a governing body and is currently part of the legal system in that country with the purpose to regulate, authorize, sanction, grant or restrict certain individual liberties.

Discriminatory legislation against women is not restricted to any one region or group of states [1] but is best known in countries such as Saudi Arabia and others with legal system strongly influenced by Sharia, the moral code and religious law of Islam. Even if the Quran states that men and women are equal, it also sustains that “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to respect the other, and because they spend from their means.”

Sharia Law applies in full, covering personal status issues as well as criminal proceedings, in Mauritania, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Iran etc. There are also countries in which sharia applies in personal status issues only (marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody), which is the case in much of the Middle East North Africa region but there it is also applied in some regions of Indonesia. It should be noted that not all Islamic countries apply sharia law.

Discrimination can take a wide verity of different forms. At its worst women become the “property” of the man and they cannot pursue anything without his approval. They are treated poorly by not being equal in front of the justice system, punishment for adultery consist most of the times in stoning or female genitalia mutilation. Elsewhere however discrimination may simply be unequal representation in the political system.
