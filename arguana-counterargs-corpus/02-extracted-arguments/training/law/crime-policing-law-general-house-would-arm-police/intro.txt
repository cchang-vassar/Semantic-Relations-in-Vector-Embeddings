Most police officers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, and New Zealand (as well as in some other, smaller countries) are routinely unarmed, whereas in the rest of the world, policemen are routinely armed. In the UK, some officers, such as those involved in diplomat protection work or airport/border security and anti-terrorism work do more routinely carry firearms, and armed response officers ( subject to certain authorisation protocols), can be quickly deployed as the need arises. In other countries such as the United States, police weapons are frequently cited in relation to issues about police ‘militarization’ and concerning the abuse of police power—often the victimization of certain ethnic communities—and so there are sometimes calls for a reduction in police reliance on firepower and/or the adoption of other ‘less-lethal’ force technologies. Yet, in a rapidly changing society, where terrorism and armed crime (and, not least, police protection) remain pressing issues, it is questioned whether having unarmed police is anything more than naïve idealism.
