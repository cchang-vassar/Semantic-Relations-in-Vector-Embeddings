Double jeopardy is a long-standing legal principle existing in many countries which dictates that a defendant cannot be tried twice for the same crime. Along with habeas corpus, it is one of the oldest rules of English law, dating back to the 12th century. Article four of the optional Seventh Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights states that nobody may be tried or punished in criminal proceedings for an offence for which he or she has already been cacquitted or convicted. Double jeopardy is prohibited in the USA by the 5th amendment to the US constitution.

In the UK there are several exceptions to the rule (See s.78-79 Criminal Justice Act 2003); most notably where new and compelling evidence has arisen and it is in the 'interests of justice' to prosecute again. In the US, the rule is stricter - only non-final judgements or fraudulent trials may be set-aside and reheard.

It is important to note the difference between a retrial following a mistrial and the double-jeopardy rule. It is not uncommon for jurisdictions to allow for trials to be stopped and heard afresh should there be some technical error or misconduct that prevents the original trial from continuing in a fair and just manner. The double-jeopardy rule applies after a trial has been successfully completed. The crucial difference between the two circumstances is that in the latter there exists a verdict which would nominally be considered conclusive on the matter.

The issues that arise in this debate depend upon the the exact mechanism being proposed. In order to avoid clashes with the definition of the status quo it is reccomended that the motion require the proposition to be bold and absolutely abolish the rule.
