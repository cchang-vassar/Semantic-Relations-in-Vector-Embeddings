In The Death of Punishment, Robert Blecker, New York University law professor and pro-death penalty activist, argues that capital punishment is a moral imperative in certain cases, which he refers to as “the worst of the worst” – if a majority of a “death-qualified” jury (one that only contains death penalty supporters who will not impose it in all cases) finds that a person convicted of murder is guilty to a “no lingering doubt” standard, that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, and the jury believe to a “Moral certainty” that the defendant should be executed, the jury must return a death sentence.

Who are the worst of the worst? This would only apply when the crime is first degree murder with aggravating circumstances:

A, Especially heinous as the killer exhibited pleasure in inflicting pain or tortured the victim

B, The victim was especially vulnerable

C, The murder was of law enforcement or emergency personnel because of their status

D, Serial killing: three or more occasions

E, mass murder: four or more victims

F, Contract killing

or aggravating motives:

A, Pecuniary – being paid for the murder

B, monetary greed

C, as a result of race, religion, etc.

D, Extraordinary selfishness – killing someone who is unresisting or a witness

E, Callousness – knowingly endangering multiple innocents

F, Sadism – relishing inflicting pain [1]

These aggravators must also outweigh any mitigating circumstances.
