The United States has not ratified the Rome Statute, the treaty that underpins the International Criminal Court. While the ICC does not have jurisdiction over actions in US territory, it does have jurisdiction where Americans are on the territory of a state that has ratified the Rome Statute, or if the situation is referred by the UN Security Council – referral of a case against the US being unlikely due to their permanent member veto.

For this reason, the United States has sought for other nations to enter in to Article 98 Agreements, also known as Bilateral Immunity Agreements, which declare that that state party will not send an American to the ICC for trial.

The legal basis for these agreements is an interpretation of article 98(2) of the Rome Statute, which states that the ICC “may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender [1] ”. The primary intent behind Article 98(2) has been argued to be to protect those subject to Status of Forces Agreements [2] , causing some to doubt the validity of Article 98 Agreements [3] . The US has taken a position insisting on ICC state parties, other than NATO members, “Major Non-NATO Allies” and Taiwan, signing agreements using article 98(2) to shield Americans from ICC prosecution as a condition for some forms of military and developmental aid, under some circumstances.

European countries that have entered into Article 98 Agreements with the United States include Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, Montenegro [4] and Romania (which was signed before their accession to the European Union [5] , who oppose Article 98 Agreements [6] and consider them illegal [7] - the others are not EU member states [8] ). Albania and Romania are members of NATO [9] , the rest are not, but may join in the future.

Should these states terminate their Article 98 agreements with the United States, or continue with them?
