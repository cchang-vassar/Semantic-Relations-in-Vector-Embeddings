The Geneva Conventions of 1949 collectively form a core part of international humanitarian law, a series of conventions and protocols that regulate armed conflict. The Geneva Conventions specifically detail a number of protections which states must extend to enemy combatants from the opposing country captured during times of war. These include prohibitions against all forms of violence including torture, humiliating and degrading treatment, and the passing of sentence without a properly constituted court hearing. In addition, medical treatment must be provided to those who need it and prisoners must be allowed to send and receive letters, enabling continued contact with their families. However, these protections only apply to soldiers of recognised armies. The global “war on terror” has pitted America and its allies against Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other non-state groups adopting irregular warfare strategies. When captured, their members (or suspected members) wear uniform and represent no sovereign state, posing problems for those holding them. The controversial treatment of terror suspects when captured by the West in other parts of the world has been repeatedly highlighted by international media organisations and human rights groups. Guantanamo Bay is a particularly disturbing example, but it is undoubtedly reflective of the way that terrorists are treated in other, less visible parts of the world. Proponents of subjecting terrorists to the Geneva Conventions argue that ostensible changes in warfare must give way to the greater need to maintain the regulations on warfare that have restricted its barbarity over the past half-century. Opponents maintain that this is neither desirable nor achievable, and that new methods are required to combat the new threat.
