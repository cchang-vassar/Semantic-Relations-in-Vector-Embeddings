For the summer of 2013, the question of security versus privacy was debated and discussed all around the world, due to the leaks about intelligence agencies surveillance systems provided by Edward Snowden to newspapers such as The Guardian. Snowden was a NSA whistleblower who revealed that the National Security Agency was conducting a massive campaign through which it was using telephones, the internet and other technologies to engage in spying, monitoring and tracking the actions of foreigners, and through other intelligence agencies such as GCHQ U.S. citizens, often without any warrant and often oversight systems were seen to be failing or ignored.

This showed the world that the intelligence services have the capability of secretly monitoring a large part of the population without anyone having a single clue. In this debate, many proponents argue that the right to privacy is inalienable and that we must protect ourselves from an otherwise abusive government, while on the other side it is claimed that it is security which should be prioritized and that this kind of measure will lead to lives being saved and criminals behind bars. At the moment, in most of western states, the police must have a warrant in order to track someoneâ€™s phone, car or internet action, but this may not or may not be the case for other surveillance as carried out by intelligence agencies.
