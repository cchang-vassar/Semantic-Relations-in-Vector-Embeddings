According to the UNESCO “Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage”, the following are constituted as objects of “cultural heritage”:

‘monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, elements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and combinations of features, which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science;

groups of buildings: groups of separate or connected buildings which, because of their architecture, their homogeneity or their place in the landscape, are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science;

sites: works of man or the combined works of nature and man, and areas including archaeological sites which are of outstanding universal value from the historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological point of view.’ [1]

Such sites and monuments that fit the above criteria are considered as part of our “world heritage” because of their ‘irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration’ for all peoples around the world. [2]

Such sites are protected under the status quo, under UNESCO Hague Convention of 1954 for the “Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict”, and the second protocol to the above convention from 1999 [3]. Specifically, UNESCO legislation exists for the protection of cultural heritage from “intentional destruction” which is defined by UNESCO ‘an act intended to destroy in whole or in part cultural heritage, thus compromising its integrity, in a manner which constitutes a violation of international law or an unjustifiable offence to the principles of humanity and dictates of public conscience, in the latter case in so far as such acts are not already governed by fundamental principles of international law.’ [4]

UNESCO demands that during times of internal or international conflict ‘states should take all appropriate measures to conduct their activities in such a manner as to protect cultural heritage, in conformity with customary international law and the principles and objectives of international agreements and UNESCO recommendations concerning the protection of such heritage during hostilities.’ [5] However the same convention also states in conditions of military necessity, a waiver can exist and the cultural property can become a legitimate military target, so long as it is deemed that no other option is available to attain a similarly important strategic advantage. [6] Cultural property of particular significance and value can be placed under a status of “enhanced protection” by UNESCO in times of conflict meaning it would no longer be susceptible to a possible waiver of “military necessity” (as under normal protection). [7] Enhanced protection does not, however, place an outright ban on military actions against the protected cultural property. The cultural property in question loses its enhanced protection if it becomes used by opposing forces and becomes a military target. [8]In essence, therefore, under the status quo the protection of objects of cultural heritage often takes a back seat in times of military conflict.

This debate, however, also concerns the deliberate destruction of cultural property during peace time. State-sponsored destruction and desecration of items, monuments or buildings of cultural heritage has been relatively common throughout history. More recent examples include the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2001, Mao’s attack on Chinese historical and cultural heritage during the so called “Cultural Revolution” in the 1960s, and most recently the destruction is shrines by Islamists in Timbuktu in 2012.[9]

Although UNESCO legislation does exist regarding the protection of cultural property, there is no international mechanism at the moment that condemns criminal acts and prosecutes individuals who are responsible for the destruction of cultural property [10]. If the destruction and desecration of sites or items of world cultural heritage were made a crime against humanity, the prosecution of those responsible for such acts would become an added responsibility of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The process would be one similar to how the ICC prosecutes war crimes and other crimes against humanity such as genocide or mass killing and torturing. The nature of crimes against humanity, according to the ICC, is such that they are crimes committed on a wide scale and systematically [11]. For this reason, although the wanton destruction of cultural property will always be condemned by UNESCO, only the following two instances would constituted a crime against humanity:

The destruction of world heritage items or sites of particular historical and cultural value,

The destruction of any protected world heritage on a massive scale

The decision of whether or not a crime against humanity has occurred would be made by UNESCO in conjunction with the ICC and experts would be consulted in the field of the nature of the destruction and the value of the cultural property in question.
