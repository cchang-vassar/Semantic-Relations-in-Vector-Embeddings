Habeas Corpus is a centuries old legal mechanism that prevents the government from arbitrarily detaining its citizens. It originated in medieval England and operates in many countries influenced by the English common law tradition. In the US, Habeas Corpus is a petition to a state or federal court, on behalf of a prisoner, requesting that the court review the basis of the person’s detention. Habeas Corpus is considered to be one of the foundations of constitutional democracy and the principle has been adopted by many countries throughout the world. In the United States Habeas Corpus is a fundamental piece of the legal system that allows capital defendants to challenge death penalty rulings and immigration detainees to challenge the legality of their detention. It is protected by Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, which states, “The privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.” [1]

After the attacks of September 11 2001, the Bush administration in the US began to challenge the applicability of Habeas Corpus to terror suspect detainees. The legal and political battles around restrictions to Habeas Corpus have been fierce. Most recently, in Boumediene vs Bush, the Supreme Court held that terror suspects detained at Guantanamo Bay are protected by Habeas Corpus.
