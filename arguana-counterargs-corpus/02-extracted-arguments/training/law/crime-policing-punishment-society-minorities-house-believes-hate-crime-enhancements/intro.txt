A hate crime is a crime, usually violent, motivated by prejudice or intolerance toward a member of a gender, racial, religious, or social group. In this resolution, hate crime "enhancements" refer to a courtâ€™s power to impose a heavier sentence on an offender if it is shown that his crime was motivated by racial hatred or other prejudices. For example, normal graffiti would not be punished severely, but if a swastika was sprayed onto a Jewish temple, there is clear racial motive behind the crime and it would attract a much more severe sentence. This pertains to all other aspects of crime, i.e. a lynching would be punished much more severely than a regular homicide. Most western liberal democracies' justice systems recognize hate crimes and punish them more severely.
