This debate can take place in a number of different spheres. At present, former leaders of the Khmer Rouge are being tried in Cambodia, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia continues to seek justice, and a small number of World War Two Nazi trials continue to be conducted. Since the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002, it has been primarily responsible for prosecutions of war crimes and crimes against humanity. This question will also be relevant to the punishment of North African and Middle Eastern dictators, currently under threat by the Arab Spring.

While the definition of war crime is constantly evolving, the perpetrators of the following are generally considered war criminals: "murder, the ill-treatment or deportation of civilian residents of an occupied territory to slave labour camps", "the murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war", the killing of prisoners, "the wanton destruction of cities, towns and villages, and any devastation not justified by military, or civilian necessity."
