On the 26 th February 2014 the Ukrainian Parliament voted to send the country’s president Viktor Yanukovych to the ICC in The Hague. And he is not the only one; at the same time they have also voted that the former interior minister Vitali Zakharchenko and the prosecutor general, Viktor Pshonka should also be tried by the ICC. This is for “crimes against humanity during peaceful protests in Ukraine since November 30, 2013 until February 22, 2014”. [1]

The protests were the result of the President deciding on 21 st November 2013 not to agree a trade and association agreement with the EU and instead turn towards Russia. Yanukovych’s actions may have been pragmatic - Ukraine needed money and Russia was willing to provide while the EU was not but the opposition took to the streets. [2] The result was months of standoff with some violence. On the 16 th January the Ukranian parliament attempted to end the protests by passing anti-protest laws which included banning any rallys, vaguely defined extremist activity, and clamping down on freedom of speech and the press. [3] The result was the protests became riots and occupations of government buildings.

Throughout the protests there had been attacks, disappearances, and beatings of protestors, [4] but on 18 th February protestors advanced on Ukraine’s parliament sparking three days of serious violence. The police used rubber bullets and live ammunition including sniper fire and automatic weapons. On the 20 th riot police attempted to regain lost ground and the Minister of the Interior Zakharchenko stated “Law enforcement officers have received service firearms and will use them in accordance with Ukraine’s law on police” so authorising the use of firearms to beat back the protesters. [5] The health ministry said there were 67 dead and 562 wounded in the three days of fighting, though the toll may well have been higher. [6]

The next day Yanukovych agreed to mediation by the French, German and Polish foreign ministers leading to a deal between the opposition and the President. The deal restored the 2004 constitution, provided an amnesty to protestors and promised elections. [7] Despite it seeming to be a deal to stop violence rather than change government Yanukovych decided the game was up and fled with the Ukrainian parliament and the protestors taking over control.

In the short term a trial in either The Hague or Ukraine is unlikely; he has turned up in Moscow. Russia has agreed to give Yanukovych protection so is unlikely to extradite him, especially as he is still a useful player as he still claims to be the President, and until a new election he has some justification to do so. [8] Yanukovych himself says “the Ukrainian parliament is illegitimate” before adding that “Decisions taken in parliament were taken under duress” so any attempt to try him is as illegitimate as the takeover.
