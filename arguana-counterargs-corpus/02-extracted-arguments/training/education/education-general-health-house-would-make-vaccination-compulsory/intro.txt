In the United Kingdom, the percentage of children who have had already at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination by their second birthdays was 88.2 % in 2009 – 2010. A much higher number than in 2008-2009 (84.9 %) or in 2003-2004 (79.9 %). The WHO (World Health Organization) suggests, that for a successful protection of the community 95 % of children need to have the jab. [1]

Vaccines represent one of the most successful and effective interventions in medicine and a lucrative business opportunity for many pharmaceutical companies. By vaccinating people, society has been able to eradicate numerous diseases that caused millions of deaths before.

A dramatic example is smallpox, which was responsible for some of the most formidable epidemics of humankind. In 1967 it was the cause of 2 million deaths; a decade later it was totally eradicated from the planet by a concerted global vaccination program [2] . Many countries have thus made it compulsory for people to be vaccinated against various diseases.

As of 2009 children in the US, Australia, Spain and Greece must have proof of vaccination before entering the public school system, although it is becoming easier in many states for parents to gain exemptions from this requirement. In the UK there is no such requirement (currently). [3]

Prior to a vaccine for polio, between 13,000 and 20,000 cases were reported in the USA annually. In 1988, the World Health Organization decided to try and eradicate polio worldwide with vaccination, and as of today, the disease has been removed from the USA, Western Pacific and Europe. Only four countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan) are endemic, and there are just 2000 cases reported worldwide annually as of 2009. [4]

But by stopping vaccination before the disease is widely eradicated leaves countries susceptible to future unexpected outbreaks. Another common disease – measles, affected nearly everyone in the United States prior to the vaccination being introduced. Between 1953 and 1963, there were 450 deaths each year from the disease. Currently in the US, three of every 1000 people who contract measles will die, whilst in the developing world, one in 100 will die. It is estimated that 90% of people who are exposed to the virus will get infected if not vaccinated against it. In 1999 according to the WHO, there were 900,000 measles related deaths worldwide. Measles can spread rapidly amongst unvaccinated populations, and if vaccinations were stopped, the WHO estimate there could be 2.7 million measles related deaths worldwide annually [5] .

Type B meningitis was prior to the vaccine the most common form of bacterial meningitis in US infants, with 20,000 annual cases, with one in 600 proving either fatal or leaving the child with some form of disability. Since the vaccine became available in 1987, the number of cases has reduced by 98%, with fewer than ten fatalities a year. [6] These are just a few examples of how vaccines can prevent and eradicate diseases that have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths throughout the past century. Although some may argue that with diseases such as Polio wiped out in most of the world a vaccine is not necessary. However any reduction in the number of people vaccinated against the disease would leave a window of opportunity for the disease to rear its head up once again.

Even though benefits are much greater if everyone is vaccinated than if not, some people choose not to be vaccinated, and have concerns about certain vaccines. Simultaneously the number of people vaccinated rose as did the movements against the notion of compulsory vaccination, such as the society of Anti Vaccinations (1798) and the Anti- Vaccination League (1853).

There should be as few obstacles as possible to such a program in order to save as many lives as possible. Some might argue that, that the government should not be able to force someone to have a needle stuck into them? They might also say that if they wish to take the risk of not having the vaccine that is their choice. However many claim, that because the risks do not just affect them, but the people around them, people should not be allowed to choose vaccines on their own. So, this essentially this debate boils down to personal liberty vs. the good of the entire society.
