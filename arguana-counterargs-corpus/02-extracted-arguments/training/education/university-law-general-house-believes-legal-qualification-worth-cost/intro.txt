As the growth of the global economy has slowed in recent years, so too have young university graduates found their job prospects declining. For many, the inclination has been to return to where they were most comfortable, namely academia. The result has been an explosion in the number of applications to Masters programs, and in the United States and the United Kingdom in particular, applications to Law School.

But is a Law degree worth it? A JD degree from a private US school, or a GDL or accelerated LLB from a UK institution can easily run beyond $120,000 in costs (and up to Â£30,000 in the UK). While salaries in the legal sector are high, the legal field has not been immune to the recession itself. A number of critics have come out to argue that law degrees are not worth the cost; they have also accused Law Schools of deliberately advertising themselves as a gateway to a number of jobs which do not in fact require the degrees.
