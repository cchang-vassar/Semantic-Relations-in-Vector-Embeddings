In many countries children are required by law to attend school up to a specific age. When children reach this required age they then often have the choice to remain in education or leave in search of employment opportunities. Among those countries that have a school leaving age there is a wide range between countries like Bangladesh, with a minimum of 10, and those, like Israel, where the leaving age is 18. 15 or 16 is currently the norm [1]. The trend however is for an increase; The UK government has raised the school leaving age to 18 with the alternative of training or an apprenticeship from 16 [2]. The age that children are allowed to leave school is often linked to the age that they are considered to be adults because governments do not want to force adults into staying in education if they do not wish to. But rights are not gained all at once some, such as the right to legally have sex, drive, and leave school are acquired before the right to do things like vote in elections. In many countries young people can choose to leave school at least two years before they are considered mature enough to vote. There is a division of opinion over whether or not young people should be allowed to leave school and seek employment before they are considered adults.
