This is an idea that has been floated by some education reform advocates (mainly conservatives) who believe that the problem of childhood discipline in the classroom cannot be remedied unless parents themselves are acting at home to engender good disciplinary habits in their children. The idea was briefly enacted in both Florida and Michigan. In Florida small fines were imposed on parents and in Michigan coveted parking permits were suspended when children misbehaved. Both programs were promptly discontinued due to parental outcry. In the United Kingdom there have been cases of parents being jailed for failing to stop their children being truant from school. [1]

Future iterations of this idea in the United States may involve charter schools where parents of children with track records of disciplinary problems voluntarily enrol their children in a school with such a contract. Charter schools can state explicit requirements of students in terms of behaviour in their charter which can then be legally enforced. [2] Modelling the debate in this fashion may help avoid some of the parental consent issues of the debate, although it is by no means necessary for proposition to take this strategy in the debate.

Another version of this debate is to hold parents liable for the criminal actions of children during school going years. For instance, if a child is caught shop lifting, one might impose a fine on the parents in addition to punishment handed down to the child. Some of the arguments below are tailored more specifically to this version of the debate, although the arguments considered can be modified to fit into either debate.

The assumption behind this brief is that by and large the children being discussed are those with chronic discipline problems.
