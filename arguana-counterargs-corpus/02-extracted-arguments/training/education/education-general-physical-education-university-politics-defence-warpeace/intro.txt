Military recruitment has diversified in recent years to include the use of schools as a platform for the armed services to present to school children on future opportunities for employment. Though not altogether unheard of previously, in the United States it has become a particularly debated subject since the 'No Child Left Behind Act' of 2002 forced all US schools which receive government funding to allow the military to talk to students. In the United Kingdom, between a third and half of all new military recruits are under 18, with many joining after meeting serving personnel at their schools. Proponents argue that military recruitment needs to diversify and expand in order to sustain numbers in preparation for or the fulfilment of military operations; prudential recruitment planning therefore would target children whom would soon reach the age of enlistment, between 16-18 in most states. Opponents of military recruitment in schools, including some parents and teachers, have protested about the targeting of children too young to be fully aware of the risks of military service. This has led the British National Union of Teachers to pass a motion in 2008 condemning military recruitment in schools. While critiques of military recruitment in schools persist, the questions remains as to whether a balance can be found between the military's need for volunteers and protecting children from excessive influence.
