In some countries, like the U.K., Japan, Hong Kong, and several African countries, school uniforms are worn in almost every school. In other countries, like France and Germany, school uniforms are only worn in a few schools, or even none. However, in some of these countries opinions are changing. For example, both France 1 and Germany 2 have recently considered bringing school uniforms back, and in the U.S.A. the percentage of public schools in which children wear a uniform has increased from 11.8 in 1999-2000 to 17.5 in 2007-2008 3. On the other hand, some schools in the U.K. have gotten rid of school uniforms 4. With such different rules in these different countries, it is important to think about whether or not school uniforms are really necessary, and why.
