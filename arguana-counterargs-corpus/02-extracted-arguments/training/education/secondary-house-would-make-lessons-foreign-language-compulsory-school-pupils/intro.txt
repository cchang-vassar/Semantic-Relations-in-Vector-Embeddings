Nearly all secondary school students (from age eleven) in EU countries are obliged to study at least one modern foreign language up to their final year. Many students study two. Some start learning foreign languages at primary level and, by school leaving age, no longer consider the languages they have acquired as “foreign”. Italy, the Republic of Ireland and the UK are the exceptions where learning a foreign language in school is not compulsory. Outside of Europe, less than half American high school students learn foreign languages [1] [2] despite 91% of secondary schools offering a foreign language as a part of the curriculum [3] . This however does not seem to be affecting the popularity of foreign languages at the tertiary level with enrolments for Arabic growing by 46% between 2006 and 2009. [4] By contrast, approximately 200 million students learn English in China, but only 24,000 US pupils make the effort to learn Chinese languages. [5]

The English speaking world seems to believe it need not learn foreign languages as most foreigners display competence in English. Foreign language learning in British schools ceased to be compulsory in 2004 and in 2010, only 44% of British GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education) students (up to 16 years) studied a language. [6]

In August 2010, the National Assembly of Wales announced its plan to spend £4 million on Welsh language training [7] and Welsh speaking schools are prevalent in Wales. All students in the Republic of Ireland study both English and Irish, and some Gaelic language schools are still in action in Scotland. However, despite being given a platform to avoid language death, these minority languages in the British Isles are not considered “foreign” and their presence does not encourage nor empower the students in the UK and Ireland to learn yet more languages.

The question therefore is whether learning foreign languages should remain compulsory for all school students up to the age of 16.
