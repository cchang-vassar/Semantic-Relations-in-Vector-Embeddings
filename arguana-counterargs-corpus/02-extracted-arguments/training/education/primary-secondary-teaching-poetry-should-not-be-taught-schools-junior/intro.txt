Poetry is an art form which uses the beauty and rhythm of language to produce emotions in a reader. It is a creative piece of writing that often has meanings and messages that appear hidden. Poetry is an ancient art form and dates back to the first human civilization in Sumer more than four thousand years ago. However, just because poetry is an ancient art form does that mean it should always be taught in schools?

Schools follow a curriculum, a set of courses that schools offer to their pupils; this is usually set by the state. This curriculum is made up of the courses that are judged to be essential to a childâ€™s education. In England at the moment poetry is part of the national curriculum; but here as elsewhere there has been discussion about whether it should continue amid arguments about how well it is taught [1].
