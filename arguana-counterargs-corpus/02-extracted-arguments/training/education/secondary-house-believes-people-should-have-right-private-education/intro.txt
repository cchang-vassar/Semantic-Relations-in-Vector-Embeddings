One of the most contentious social issues in most countries is that of education. In education, people see a clear route to a better life for their children. Most people regard some level of education as a right; the degree of education to which we are entitled by right varies from country to country. In Britain, the state provides a free education, for all children, from age 5-18. The aim is to produce a comprehensive and high-quality education for all its citizens. However, if a degree is then pursued, it must be undertaken at the student’s expense. This education system is supplemented in Britain by independent, fee-paying schools to which parents can send their children if they can afford it. There is an added confusion when talking about private schools in Britain, as they are often referred to as ‘Public Schools’. In Australia one in three students attends private schools (econrsss), a large growth from the one in five that attended private schools in the 1970’s. Some of the reasons given for this shift include government funding policy and regulations, the strategic marketing decisions of private schools, and the relative quality of government schools (econrsss). Which illustrates the relationship between private and state schools is affected by a variety of situations. In India children’s education is compulsory up to the age of 14. The Government fund 80% of the schools in India, and only 27% of its population attend private school. Yet according to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a fraction of the unit cost of government schools (GPRG.org). The British model raises many questions, not just pertaining to itself, but to more general issues as well: do you have a right to an education? To what sort of education are you entitled? If parents wish to send their children to a private school, should they have the right so to do?
