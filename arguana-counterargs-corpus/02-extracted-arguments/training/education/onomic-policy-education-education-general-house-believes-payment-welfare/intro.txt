The majority of the world's states have some form of welfare program meant to ensure the economic and social wellbeing of their citizens who may find themselves in dire economic straits, like unemployment, subsistence farming or landless day labour. The government may give financial benefits to those who see themselves unable to provide for their children and their families. However, there are those who think that such benefits should not be unconditionally awarded, but should involve some responsibilities. Benefits should impose certain obligations on the recipients to better their situation. One such obligation is to send their children to school and monitor their attendance. This measure is meant to break the poverty trap by ensuring the children of the poorest families receive the education and qualifications they need to be able to find a suitable job when they themselves reach adulthood. Such programs, called 'conditional cash transfers' have been implemented by governments and international organizations in some developing countries, most notably Brazil, where it is known as Bolsa Familia. Around the world 67 million children are not in school, which only continues cycles of poverty and disease 1. In order to determine whether such measures are desirable, the proposition needs to show first that there is an acceptable guiding principle behind the policy. Then it would need to demonstrate that the policy would be effective in achieving not only its immediate goal -- getting kids into school -- but its wider, professed aim -- improving their situation in the long run. 1 Enriquez, Florence (2011), "67 million children worldwide not in school", United Nations Radio, [Accessed July 21, 2011].
