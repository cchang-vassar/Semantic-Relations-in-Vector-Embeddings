France sent 2000 soldiers, a rapid increase from an initial 550, backed by helicopter gunships and fighter jets to the West African country of Mali. [1] The troops weee being sent both to secure the capital, Bamako, and to the front lines in a fight against Islamists who have overrun Azawad, the northern half of Mali. [2]

The end of the conflict in Libya in 2011 with the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi both meant a large number of militants who had been fighting for the Libyan dictator fleeing south and a large influx of weaponry into North Africa. Some of this weaponry found its way to the Tuareg tribes of northern Mali some of whom under the banner of National Movement for Azawad have fought for the establishment of a Tuareg state first upon independence in 1962 and more recently in the early 1990s. These weapons provided the opportunity for a renewed bid by a successor organisation the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). [3] Attacks started on towns in the far north east of the country in the middle of January 2012, by the middle of March the rebels were closing in on Timbuktu.

A Coup on 21 st March toppled the Malian President Touré with Captain Amadou Sanogo, its leader, citing the poor handling of the conflict as the reason. Civilian government was reinstated only a couple of weeks later with Amadou Sanogo standing down in favour of Diouncounda Traore the speaker of the Parliament. [4] Traore promised to “wage a total and relentless war” to reclaim the north of the country.

While the coup had been going on however the Malian army had effectively been forced out of the Azawad region. The MNLA therefore declared independence and stopped advancing. [5] This however was not the end of conflict in the region as the MNLA soon faced a challenge from the more Islamist organisations Ansar Dine and Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOWJA) who wanted much stricter imposition of Sharia Law. After clashes through the summer of 2012 between the groups the MNLA were forced out of much of the territory they had conquered, no one group has been able to control the whole region. [6]

The interim government of Diouncounda Traore proved no more capable than its predecessors of forcing out the Isla mists and separatists. It therefore called the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for help. On 12 th October the Security Council demanded “that all armed groups cease human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law” and “provide[d] military and security planners to assist ECOWAS and the African Union… in the joint planning efforts… for an international military force”. [7] This however did not authorise force, and it quickly became apparent that there would be no intervention until the end of 2013.

This however changed when the Islamists launched a new offensive capturing the town of Konna just 600km from the capital. This meant that the French government felt "We must stop the rebels' offensive, otherwise the whole of Mali will fall into their hands - creating a threat for Africa and even for Europe". President Hollande therefore ordered air strikes and the deployment of troops on the 11 th January 2013. [8]

French forces intervened in Operation Serval, leading to all major cities returning in to the control of the Malian government. On the 27 th of January French forces recaptured Timbuktu, and Gao soon after. The French troops started withdrawing on the 25 th of May but still (from February 2014) has 1600 troops in the country. [9] This intervention was popular, with an Al Jazeera poll indicating that 96% of residents of Bamako supported the French military role [10] .
