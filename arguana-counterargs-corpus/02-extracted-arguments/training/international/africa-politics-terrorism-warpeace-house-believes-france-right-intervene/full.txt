# THESIS
This House believes France is right to intervene in Mali


# INTRO
France sent 2000 soldiers, a rapid increase from an initial 550, backed by helicopter gunships and fighter jets to the West African country of Mali. [1] The troops weee being sent both to secure the capital, Bamako, and to the front lines in a fight against Islamists who have overrun Azawad, the northern half of Mali. [2]

The end of the conflict in Libya in 2011 with the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi both meant a large number of militants who had been fighting for the Libyan dictator fleeing south and a large influx of weaponry into North Africa. Some of this weaponry found its way to the Tuareg tribes of northern Mali some of whom under the banner of National Movement for Azawad have fought for the establishment of a Tuareg state first upon independence in 1962 and more recently in the early 1990s. These weapons provided the opportunity for a renewed bid by a successor organisation the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA). [3] Attacks started on towns in the far north east of the country in the middle of January 2012, by the middle of March the rebels were closing in on Timbuktu.

A Coup on 21 st March toppled the Malian President Touré with Captain Amadou Sanogo, its leader, citing the poor handling of the conflict as the reason. Civilian government was reinstated only a couple of weeks later with Amadou Sanogo standing down in favour of Diouncounda Traore the speaker of the Parliament. [4] Traore promised to “wage a total and relentless war” to reclaim the north of the country.

While the coup had been going on however the Malian army had effectively been forced out of the Azawad region. The MNLA therefore declared independence and stopped advancing. [5] This however was not the end of conflict in the region as the MNLA soon faced a challenge from the more Islamist organisations Ansar Dine and Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MOWJA) who wanted much stricter imposition of Sharia Law. After clashes through the summer of 2012 between the groups the MNLA were forced out of much of the territory they had conquered, no one group has been able to control the whole region. [6]

The interim government of Diouncounda Traore proved no more capable than its predecessors of forcing out the Isla mists and separatists. It therefore called the United Nations, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for help. On 12 th October the Security Council demanded “that all armed groups cease human rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law” and “provide[d] military and security planners to assist ECOWAS and the African Union… in the joint planning efforts… for an international military force”. [7] This however did not authorise force, and it quickly became apparent that there would be no intervention until the end of 2013.

This however changed when the Islamists launched a new offensive capturing the town of Konna just 600km from the capital. This meant that the French government felt "We must stop the rebels' offensive, otherwise the whole of Mali will fall into their hands - creating a threat for Africa and even for Europe". President Hollande therefore ordered air strikes and the deployment of troops on the 11 th January 2013. [8]

French forces intervened in Operation Serval, leading to all major cities returning in to the control of the Malian government. On the 27 th of January French forces recaptured Timbuktu, and Gao soon after. The French troops started withdrawing on the 25 th of May but still (from February 2014) has 1600 troops in the country. [9] This intervention was popular, with an Al Jazeera poll indicating that 96% of residents of Bamako supported the French military role [10] .

# PRO01A-POINT
France was asked to intervene by Mali’s government

“France has answered… a request for assistance issued by the interim president of the Republic of Mali”. France is therefore not coming in uninvited. Mali’s President Traore directly appealed to French President Hollande to provide “French military assistance against these terrorist groups” that have “attacked our front lines of defense”. [1] As the former colonial power in much of West Africa, including Mali, France is the obvious country to turn to for help. As a result of this colonial past Mali is a member of the French led Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. [2] Mali is therefore fully within its sovereign rights to ask for assistance and Hollande is right to agree to provide it.

[2] ‘Welcome to the International Organisation of La Francophonie’s official website’ http://www.francophonie.org/English.html

# PRO01B-COUNTER
Mali should be asking for diplomatic help to resolve the crisis not asking for a military force. France meanwhile should not be accepting a request from an unelected President to attack his own people. A request to intervene in a country does not make that intervention legitimate it simply provides a fig leaf to protect France from accusations of colonialism.

# PRO02A-POINT
Fighting terrorism

While it was Tuareg separatists who first sparked the insurrection wanting to split Mali but now the North has been taken over by Islamists and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb presenting a terrorist threat that cannot be ignored. France’s Defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says "France's goal is to lead a relentless struggle against terrorist groups," and that "We have to eradicate this terrorism". [1] The United States was already clearly worried about Mali becoming a center of terrorism having on the 7th December designated the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa a terrorist organisation while other groups involved in Mali such as al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb were already designated as such. The State department highlights several terrorist attacks the group has conducted such as “a March 2012 suicide attack on a police base in Tamanrasset, Algeria, which wounded 23 people”. [2]

# PRO02B-COUNTER
If terrorism is the concern then the French intervening is one of the worst possible options. Having France fighting in Mali may well result in the internationalization of the conflict bringing in jihadists. [1] Already the islamists are saying the conflict is a holy war as “France has attacked Islam” and they will in response “strike at the heart of France”. [2]

# PRO03A-POINT
It is a humanitarian intervention

Fundamentally at its heart this is a humanitarian intervention by the French. The Islamists who took over Northern Mali have been imposing a severe, austere form of Islam demanding "No cigarettes, no CDs, no radios, no cameras, no jewelry" and beating those who disobey the rules. Men and women have to sit in separate areas in buses. With Sharia being more strictly enforced with increasing number of amputations despite opposition from the local population. [1] Much of the population of the North had already fled to the south with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees saying 200,000 have fled since January 2012. [2] Those who have, like Moussa from Timbuktu, clearly welcome the intervention, he told a French radio station “We have been suffocating and [France] has given us a breath of oxygen. We are ready to fly Malian and French flags alongside each other.” [3]

# PRO03B-COUNTER
Ban Ki Moon has also stated that “I am profoundly aware that if a military intervention in the north is not well conceived and executed, it could worsen an already fragile humanitarian situation and also result in severe human rights abuses” [1] so French military intervention is not necessarily the right course to take if the intention is to be helping the people of northern Mali. Equally we can ask if this will really end the civil war? Mali has suffered from several Tuareg rebellions in the past. In particular there was a civil war between 1990 and 1996 [2] which has had over a decade of sporadic peace negotiations while a cease fire held. So while outside intervention may end the civil war unless the French propose to remain in place for decades or work instead on a diplomatic solution in the long run Mali will be no better off.

# PRO04A-POINT
French interests

This intervention is not all about terrorism and a humanitarian desire to end a civil war. France does have a stake in the conflict and a reason to deploy military forces. There are 6,000 French citizens living in Mali who are obviously at risk to a rebel advance; even without a full scale intervention France would almost certainly have had to deploy forces to protect an evacuation. Already there are seven French citizens being held hostage in Mali and rescuing them is one of the three main objectives for the French intervention. [1]

[1] Welsh, Jennifer, ‘Sending soldiers to Mali may be the only solution’, The Globe and Mail, 14 January 2012, http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/why-france-couldnt-wait-for-a-regional-solution-in-mali/article7318783/

# PRO04B-COUNTER
This might be an excuse to send a few soldiers to help evacuation and possibly a commando raid to free hostages but it is not a reason for all out intervention. If it was such a justification then in almost any conflict some state would have just cause to intervene because some of their citizens were in danger.


# CON01A-POINT
Western countries should not be interfering in African internal affairs

Western nations should clearly not be interfering in African affairs. Not only is this conflict outside of NATO’s remit but it is internal to an individual African state rather than a war between states. By intervening France and other nations are taking part in a civil war in which they are aiding a government that was placed in office by a military coup in March 2012 so does not have a democratic mandate. [1]

This intervention is an example of France once more playing the role of gendarme and considering that it has some kind of divine right to intervene in Africa. [2] This war is of course in large part France’s fault in the first place; it is trying to hold together a nation that should be split in two as a result of artificial colonial borders that fan conflict by dividing communities. [3] In this case France is intervening to deny a legitimate people’s, the Tuareg, their right to self-determination. The Tuaregs are divided between Algeria, Kibya, Mali, and Niger but without a majority in any. [4] The Turegs when they took control of Azawad made a declaration of independence. [5] While this has not been recognised this simply shows how existing states are worried about accepting the logic of self-determination when they themselves have groups that may want independence.

# CON01B-COUNTER
Self-determination should first be internal rather than external. [1] In other words self-determination means autonomy within the existing state not a new state unless there is no other way of resolving the conflict. In Mali therefore the rebels need to put down their weapons and accept the authority of the central government, whose will the French and others are trying to enforce. It is clear that the people of northern Mali would prefer a solution within the state of Mali as half the population has fled to the south [2] and Ansar Dine and MNLA have walked back their declaration of independence promising “respect for Mali's national unity and territorial integrity” in December.

# CON02A-POINT
African organisations should have lead the way

The United Nations charter is quite clear that it should be African Nations leading the way in this conflict. It says “The Security Council shall encourage the development of pacific settlement of local disputes through such regional arrangements or by such regional agencies” [1] and since there are several African Security Organisations there is little reason why these could not have taken the lead. The African Union in particular has undertaken interventions in similar situations before; notably in Somalia. [2] This has been recognised right up until the French intervened and the UN Security Council resolution in December mandated for “the deployment of an African-led mission to support efforts by national authorities to recover the north.” [3]

# CON02B-COUNTER
This is ignoring both that African nations are taking a leading role in this intervention and that it is them who have asked for intervention by western states.

First of All Nigeria is going to send 600 troops, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Togo 500 each, and Benin 300. These numbers far outweigh the 550 being sent by France and logistical support provided by other countries such as the UK and US. [1] It can therefore be said that this is an African mission.

Secondly the resolution in December did call for “coordination with the European Union and other partners”. [2] ECOWAS had already in December called for the United Nations to intervene [3] and “thanks the French Government for its initiatives to support Mali.” [4]

# CON03A-POINT
Quagmire

Western states seem to so often be willing to get involved in conflicts without thinking about how to get out of them. Interventions are difficult operations that need a lot of planning and the United Nations has previously said that in the case of Mali "Nothing could be done before September, October," and there should be diplomatic talks and a rebuilding of the Malian army first. [1] Unless there is a clear exit plan then there is the risk that the conflict in Mali will turn into a Quagmire from which French and other Western forces cannot easily extradite themselves.

The conflict has not resulted in many French casualties although they did have a helicopter shot down. [2] However there is still a question of how long France will have to keep a military presence in the country. The French initially said they would be pulling troops out in March; [3] the first troops did not leave until May. They said they would only have 1000 there by the end of the year [4] but in January 2014 still had 2500. [5]

The French have rejected any parallel with Afghanistan and other quagmires. Fabius, France’s Foreign Minister, has said that "Later on, we can come as back-up, but we have no intention of staying forever," [1] the handover may be slower than anticipated but there is no evidence the French will be in Mali for an extended period.
