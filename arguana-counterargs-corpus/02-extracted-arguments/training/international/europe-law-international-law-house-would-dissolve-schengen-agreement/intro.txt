The origins of the Schengen free travel area date back to 1985, when France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands signed an agreement to abolish controls at their common frontiers and create a shared external perimeter. [1] If These governments agreed to abolish border checks on the borders that they shared; instead of stop and search tactics, every vehicle which had a green visa disc in the windscreen could simply drive on through [2] . However, there were still to be guards on the borders to visually check the vehicles as they crossed into another country. This is commonly known as Schengen I. The 1990 Schengen Implementation Agreement, which is also known as Schengen II, went one step further; it made provisions for the complete elimination of border checks over a period of time [3] . The Schengen Agreements were elaborated outside of the European Union’s ( EU)legal framework. Only with 1997 Amsterdam Treaty they were incorporated into the EU [4] .

The Schengen Area currently consists of 25 European countries [5] , covering a population of over 400 million people and an area of 4,312,099 square km [6] . Norway, Switzerland and Iceland, although not part of the EU, have signed on to the Schengen agreement [7] . Andorra, Liechtenstein and San Marino are not part of Schengen, but they no longer have checks at their borders [8] . Ireland and the United Kingdom have chosen to remain outside the Schengen Zone.

The main measures of the agreement are [9] :

1) the removal of checks at internal borders, replacing them with external border checks at the edges of the Schengen area

2) separation in air terminals and ports of people traveling within the Schengen area from those arriving from countries outside the area 3) harmonizing the rules regarding conditions of entry and visas for short stays (including the creation of the single Schengen visa) 4) coordination between administrations on surveillance of borders

5) the strengthening of legal cooperation through a faster extradition system and faster distribution of information about the implementation of criminal judgments 6) the creation of the Schengen Information System (SIS).
