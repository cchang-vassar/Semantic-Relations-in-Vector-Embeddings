Africa is known as a continent in conflict; it is sometimes called ‘the Dark continent’. The creation of an African Union standing army would be one way of attempting to create peace on the continent. A standing army is a permanent, often professional, army. Setting up such a permanent force for the AU would be the first permanent force for an international organisation that is not made up of forces seconded from national armies. The AU Constitutive Act does not authorise such a creation but does have objectives of achieving “greater unity and solidarity”, accelerating political integration, promoting peace, and a principle to “establishment of a common defence policy for the African Continent”. [1] However as with any international organisation a core principle is “sovereign equality” and “non-interference” this force is primarily going to be about peacekeeping and peace-making. This will be in response to the use of “the right of Member States to request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace and security” but the Union could also “intervene in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity”. [2]

The African Union has been active in peacekeeping. Since the end of 2003 the AU’s Peace and Security Council has had responsibility for maintaining peace in Africa. It is the body that decides on interventions by the AU. [3] Since then the AU has been most notably involved in the conflict in Somalia but has also been in Sudan, Burundi and the Central African Republic. Also in 2003 the AU decided to create the African Standby Force. This consists of five regional brigades of slightly over 4000 troops which should be available for rapid deployment anywhere in Africa. These however are multinational brigades that remain in their home countries armed forces rather than a permanent AU force. [4] It has regularly been delayed so it might seem odd to propose something more ambitious. An AU army would however avoid some of the problems associated with this force of coordinating from numerous different forces and ensuring they all remain up to standard by centralising.
