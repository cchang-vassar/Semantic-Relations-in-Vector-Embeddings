The East African community was formed in November 1999 by the Republics of Uganda, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania following the collapse of a previous community in 1977. Rwanda and Burundi later joined the organisation in July 2007. With a strong vision of a prosperous, stable, competitive, secure and politically united East Africa, (1) the bloc has been hailed as the most active, vibrant and successful in the African continent.(2) Progress has been made in lifting immigration checks and controls to allow free movement of people among member states without travel documents, introducing the common market to boost trade in the region, unifying the education system, and most recently signing up to an East African monetary union with an aim of introducing one currency in 2024. The communities successes has encouraged neighbouring countries including Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and the Democratic Republic Of Congo to show interest in joining the organisation (3) with a most recent application from South Sudan in July 2011. The East African Community therefore has both options to widen by letting in new members and to deepen the community by implementing its proposed monetary union. Should the community be focused on deepening or widening?
