Over the past fifty years the European Union has grown to include 27 member states and 455 million people, accounting for the large majority of European countries. A number of former Yugoslav states in the Western Balkans remain outside the EU, but all are eager to join and several have already begun negotiations to do so. Outside the Balkans, the only notable European states to resist the lure of EU membership are Switzerland and Norway – in both governments have explored joining the EU but the prospect was rejected by voters. This topic examines whether they should now apply again to join the Union. To a large extent similar arguments apply to both countries, but they do differ in detail and the issues below could be adapted for a debate specifically about either Norway or Switzerland.

Switzerland originally applied to join the EU in 1992 but its voters have twice rejected the membership of the European Economic Area that would have provided Switzerland with a route to do so. Instead the Swiss have negotiated a range of bilateral agreements with Brussels that allow free movement of goods and people in both directions. Most of Switzerland’s political parties have favored membership, but the Swiss People’s Party (SVP), which strongly rejects the idea, has gained in popularity and influence in recent years. In 2005 the coalition government decided that EU membership was no longer a strategic goal for the country; now it is merely a long-term possibility.

Norway has twice applied to join the EU, with both applications being rejected by its voters in referendums (in 1972 and 1994). Many of its politicians continue to favor eventual EU membership, but after these past experiences they are cautious about asking voters a third time. Unlike Switzerland, Norway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and so participates in most areas of the EU’s Single Market, as well as cooperating closely with Brussels on issues such as justice and peacekeeping.
