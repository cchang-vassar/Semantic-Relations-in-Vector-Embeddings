One of the great successes of the United Nations has been the acceptance that interstate war is wrong, the acceptance that “All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”. [1] There is some debate about whether this has actually meant that there that there is actually less war, or indeed whether it will actually stop another world war from happening, [2] but one thing it has done is make almost everyone recognise that waging war should be considered to be illegal. Now it is generally assumed that initiating a military action against another state can only be legal if there is backing from the United Nations Security Council.

Yet there have been attempts to chip away at this concept. In 1999 NATO intervened in Kosovo without the authorisation of the Security Council because Russia would not countenance intervention against its ally Serbia. The United States did not advance solid legal claims that it was legally entitled to engage in a conflict against Serbia as a result of the ethnic cleansing occurring in Kosovo. NATO did not see UNSC authorisation or justify on the basis of self defense it simply ignored the international norm against intervention. In doing so it may have changed that norm. [3]

The US and Coalition of the Willing’s invasion of Iraq was another breach of this norm against interstate war that is not authorised by the Security Council or in self defense. There was more adherence to norms against the use of military force than in the Kosovo campaign; there were attempts to claim self defense, and George W. Bush and Tony Blair went to the Security Council to try and gain assent to go to war. When this failed they attempted to claim that a previous resolution, 1441, was sufficient authorisation to use force. It is however generally accepted, except by the governments involved, that resolution 1441 did not by itself authorise force. [4]

Since these interventions the concept that there may be a humanitarian reason to intervene has become more accepted. The United Nations has not gone for a full doctrine of humanitarian intervention but in 2005 did agree to a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ in which states accepted responsibility to protect against genocide and other crimes against humanity but the acceptance was simply to act, not explicitly an acceptance of the use of force. [5] This was used as justification in a NATO action to protect Benghazi in 2012, but this air assault, unlike Kosovo or Iraq, had UN Security Council authorisation as Russia and China abstained.

Although Russia and China abstained in the case of Libya on other issues where the United States might want to take action they have not been so obliging. Any attempt to attack Iran, or Syria, or North Korea, or practically anywhere for any reason is liable to be blocked. The result from the point of view of the Americans is that the Security Council is broken and as such they may need to go it alone, or in a coalition with other like-minded states. [6] If it is action to prevent atrocities should it be considered legal if the intervening power can’t get authorization from its peers?
