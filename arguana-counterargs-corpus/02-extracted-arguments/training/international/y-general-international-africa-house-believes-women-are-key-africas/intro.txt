Africa is a continent with great economic potential. Foreign investors are competing to enter the market and invest. That potential however is only in part met as a result of the limited role of women in the economy.

Currently one of the most important economic sectors in Africa is agriculture. It accounts for more than 32% of Africa’s GDP and it accounts for around 65% of Africa’s employment [1] . As the economy develops this preponderance is likely to decline as it has done in other countries as they develop but agriculture will still remain important for reducing famine and malnutrition.

The majority of the people working in the field are women. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, women in Africa are responsible for 70% of crop production, 50% of animal husbandry and 60% of marketing. Women undertake nearly 100% of food processing activities, in addition to child care and other responsibilities in households. [2]

Agriculture both illustrates how women are vital to African future prosperity and some of the problems along the road to prosperity. Women in Africa have few rights; they can seldom own land, although they are working it, they cannot take loans from banks in order to invest, and many of them lack a basic education. Women own less than 1% of the African continent’s landmass. Only 51% of females over the age of 15 in Africa are able to read and write, compared to 67% men. It is estimated that this inequality reduces Africa’s annual per capita growth by 0.8%. If this growth had taken place Africa’s economies would have doubled over the last 30 years. [3]

Women, therefore, might be considered to be key to Africa’s economic future. That is if the continent can overcome these inequalities to provide women with the necessary training, with rights and liberties to move freely in the market, to run their own businesses and make their own economic decisions. Women represent a pool of untapped labour. One of the biggest mistakes to be made in any economy is to misuse one’s factors of production. Time has come for Africa to start integrating women into the economy and to start maximizing their potential as future entrepreneurs.
