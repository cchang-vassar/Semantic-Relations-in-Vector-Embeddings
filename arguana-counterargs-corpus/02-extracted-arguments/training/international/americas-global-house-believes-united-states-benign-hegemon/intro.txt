Following the end of World War II, the United States emerged as the pre-eminent power in the world—a superpower according to many interpretations—and actively shaped global institutions (such as NATO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), alliance structures, and inter-state relationships. During the Cold War the official rationale for its activist foreign policy focused on the need to contain the Soviet Union, which was regarded as an expansionist Communist power that threatened the liberal democracies of the ‘free world’. However, when the Soviet Union and consequently the bipolar structure of global politics (meaning the dominance of the world order by two competing states) collapsed, the US’s role as the “world police” still continued, as demonstrated by the continuation of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), which was a distinctly Cold War alliance. Indeed, many argue the world entered a “unipolar moment”, where the US remained unchallenged on all indices of power. Ever since, the United States has been viewed as the single superpower, dominating the world economically, militarily and culturally. This has especially been the case in the military sphere, where America’s defence budget is almost equal to the rest of the world’s combined. A key question at this juncture is whether such a dominance of power has been used in a manner that has provided benefits to the international community, or whether it has been utilised to secure the narrow imperial interests of the United States. Engaging more deeply with this question has led many to ask: is the US a ‘benign’ hegemon, or is it an imperialist power and even an empire? Hegemony is based on a hierarchical order in which one state is ‘powerful enough to maintain the essential rules governing interstate relations, and willing to do so.’ [1] ** Importantly, a large part of the hegemon’s power depends on consensus between states rather than brute force and thus many argue American hegemony has been successful because the US has managed to establish a broadly accepted rules-based liberal international order. [2] American dominance spreads stability and prosperity across the globe. Others tend to disagree. Critics contend that the US employs imperialism, which denotes ‘effective control, whether formal or informal, of a subordinated society by an imperial society.’ [3] The character of these imperial relationships is often exploitative, coercive and defined by self-interest, and therefore many advocate policies designed to check US power and to work with other states in order to provide alternative centers of global influence. Opponents of this position challenge the view that the US is an empire, arguing that it is a mistake to conflate primacy with imperialism. It is clear that this debate is complex, multifaceted and requires critical reflection.

* Benign hegemony refers to the United States using other states to extend its influence/power. In terms of this debate the USA is acting in an imperial manner but through a softer approach- using tactics like diplomacy rather than military action to get other states to bend to its’ will.

**American hegemony is refers to the United States’ dominant global influence on the international community because of their economic, political and military strength resulting in shaping the international community through institutions, norms, ideology and economics.
