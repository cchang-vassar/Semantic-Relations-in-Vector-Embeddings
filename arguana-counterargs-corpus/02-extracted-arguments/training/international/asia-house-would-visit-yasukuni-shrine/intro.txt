The Yasukuni Shrine was established as the Tōkyō Shōkonsha in 1869 and renamed Yasukuni Shrine in 1879. This was immediately after the Boshin War – a conflict between supporters of the Shōgunate and those who wanted to restore the Emperor to political power – the Emperor Meiji ordered the construction of the shrine to honor those who had died for their country during this war. [1]

“I assure those of you who fought and died for your country that your names will live forever at this shrine in Musashino” so reads a poem composed by the Emperor Meiji for the shrine demonstrating the purpose of the shrine to honor those who have fought and died for Japan. In this the Yasukuni is not too dissimilar from other national cemeteries around the world. Arlington National Cemetery in the United States’ mission is “On behalf of the American people, lay to rest those who have served our nation with dignity and honor.” [2] This is very similar to Meiji’s poem. Daejeon National Cemetery in South Korea’s introduction message says “Daejeon National Cemetery is the sacred place in which those who sacrificed themselves to protect and defend our people and nation are buried in peaceful rest”. [3]

Where the Yasukuni is different is in the controversy surrounding it. There are 2,466,000 souls enshrined at the shrine and almost all of these are military. They are from those who died during wars fought by Japan from the Bonshin War through to the Second World War. [4] However most of these conflicts (with the exception of the Bonshin War and the Satsuma Rebellion) were wars of aggression.

Most controversial however is the enshrinement of war criminals. At the end of World War II the victorious allies instituted The International Military Tribunal for the Far East, otherwise known as the Tokyo Trials, to try those Japanese who had played large roles in planning the war or had allowed criminal acts to take place. There were more than 5700 Japanese charged with war crimes. 1068 of these are enshrined at Yasukuni. Fourteen of the enshrined are Class A criminals, including the Hideki Tōjō Prime Minister during world war II, who were convicted of crimes against peace “namely, planning, preparation, initiation, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing”. [5]

Not all Japanese recognise that these people were war criminals with a phamphlet at Yasukuni having stated “Some 1,068 people, who were wrongly accused as war criminals by the Allied court, were enshrined here”. [6] Many Japanese consider the courts to be victor’s justice. There is therefore a conflict as a result of a minority in Japan who believe they should honor their dead in Yasukuni and essentially deny that the problem of war criminals exists.

Yasukuni is has only quite recently become a political controversy. During the 16 years from 1985 to Koizumi becoming Prime Minister there were only visits on four occasions by Prime Ministers, with only one of them an official visit. [7] Prime Minister Koizumi visited every year he was in office but Prime Ministers have not visited since. Despite this controversy had continued as cabinet ministers continue to visit, the Prime Minister has sometimes sent an aide with an offering in his stead as Abe did on 15 August 2013, and each visit by any cabinet minister sparks protest and outrage from Japan’s neighbours. [8]

A related lesser controversy is that some of the 27,863 Taiwanese and 21181 Koreans who are enshrined at Yasukuni are there against the wishes of the deceased’s families leading to accusations that they have in effect been kidnapped in death. [9]

p.s. This debate might be better with the motion switched around to be ‘This House would not visit the Yasukuni shrine’ because the status quo is that politicians, including senior ones, visit almost every year. However I believe that making motions negative adds an element of confusion making it more difficult to follow. The arguments would be the same anyway, simply reversed.
