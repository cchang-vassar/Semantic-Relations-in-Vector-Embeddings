# THESIS
This House would visit the Yasukuni Shrine


# INTRO
The Yasukuni Shrine was established as the Tōkyō Shōkonsha in 1869 and renamed Yasukuni Shrine in 1879. This was immediately after the Boshin War – a conflict between supporters of the Shōgunate and those who wanted to restore the Emperor to political power – the Emperor Meiji ordered the construction of the shrine to honor those who had died for their country during this war. [1]

“I assure those of you who fought and died for your country that your names will live forever at this shrine in Musashino” so reads a poem composed by the Emperor Meiji for the shrine demonstrating the purpose of the shrine to honor those who have fought and died for Japan. In this the Yasukuni is not too dissimilar from other national cemeteries around the world. Arlington National Cemetery in the United States’ mission is “On behalf of the American people, lay to rest those who have served our nation with dignity and honor.” [2] This is very similar to Meiji’s poem. Daejeon National Cemetery in South Korea’s introduction message says “Daejeon National Cemetery is the sacred place in which those who sacrificed themselves to protect and defend our people and nation are buried in peaceful rest”. [3]

Where the Yasukuni is different is in the controversy surrounding it. There are 2,466,000 souls enshrined at the shrine and almost all of these are military. They are from those who died during wars fought by Japan from the Bonshin War through to the Second World War. [4] However most of these conflicts (with the exception of the Bonshin War and the Satsuma Rebellion) were wars of aggression.

Most controversial however is the enshrinement of war criminals. At the end of World War II the victorious allies instituted The International Military Tribunal for the Far East, otherwise known as the Tokyo Trials, to try those Japanese who had played large roles in planning the war or had allowed criminal acts to take place. There were more than 5700 Japanese charged with war crimes. 1068 of these are enshrined at Yasukuni. Fourteen of the enshrined are Class A criminals, including the Hideki Tōjō Prime Minister during world war II, who were convicted of crimes against peace “namely, planning, preparation, initiation, or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing”. [5]

Not all Japanese recognise that these people were war criminals with a phamphlet at Yasukuni having stated “Some 1,068 people, who were wrongly accused as war criminals by the Allied court, were enshrined here”. [6] Many Japanese consider the courts to be victor’s justice. There is therefore a conflict as a result of a minority in Japan who believe they should honor their dead in Yasukuni and essentially deny that the problem of war criminals exists.

Yasukuni is has only quite recently become a political controversy. During the 16 years from 1985 to Koizumi becoming Prime Minister there were only visits on four occasions by Prime Ministers, with only one of them an official visit. [7] Prime Minister Koizumi visited every year he was in office but Prime Ministers have not visited since. Despite this controversy had continued as cabinet ministers continue to visit, the Prime Minister has sometimes sent an aide with an offering in his stead as Abe did on 15 August 2013, and each visit by any cabinet minister sparks protest and outrage from Japan’s neighbours. [8]

A related lesser controversy is that some of the 27,863 Taiwanese and 21181 Koreans who are enshrined at Yasukuni are there against the wishes of the deceased’s families leading to accusations that they have in effect been kidnapped in death. [9]

p.s. This debate might be better with the motion switched around to be ‘This House would not visit the Yasukuni shrine’ because the status quo is that politicians, including senior ones, visit almost every year. However I believe that making motions negative adds an element of confusion making it more difficult to follow. The arguments would be the same anyway, simply reversed.


# PRO01A-POINT
Every nation should be allowed to respect its war dead

Every nation should be allowed to honor its war dead how it wishes. Wars are horrifying times and atrocities are almost always committed by all sides. Japan’s actions in its wars, particularly the Second World War were particularly brutal but this should not mean that Japans leaders should be banned from paying their respects to their ancestors who died fighting for their country. Most nations do this in one way or another. The difference is that Yasukuni has those who were convicted criminals enshrined but others also honor those who have committed acts that might be considered criminal. Perhaps the most extreme example is the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong right at the heart of Beijing where there are still big celebrations to mark his birthday – unlike Shintoism in Japan Maoism is still very much part of the ideology of the state. [1]

[1] Analects, ‘Mao’s birthday Party time, The Economist, 7 June 2013, http://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/06/maos-birthday

# PRO01B-COUNTER
If the Japanese politicians wish to honor their war dead there is another option for them; they could visit the Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery. The Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery houses the remains of the unknown Japanese soldiers who died overseas during the second world war. [1] This is both a broader cemetery in that it honors civilians who died in the war as well as soldiers and narrower as it is only those remains that are unidentified so it does not contain war criminals as Yasukuni does.

# PRO02A-POINT
Freedom of religion

Everyone is entitled to freedom of religion and that applies to the Japanese as much as any other peoples. Yasukuni is a shrine in the Shinto religion – equivalent to a church - and was the center of state Shinto through the first half of the twentieth century. [1] Refusing to allow Japanese ministers to visit the shrine might therefore be said to be similar to barring British politicians from Westminster Abbey because there is a memorial stone to Oliver Cromwell there and as a result it could be interpreted as offensive to the Irish – Westminister Abbey’s page notably avoids mentioning the Wexford and Drogheda massacres that are remembered by the Irish. [2]

# PRO02B-COUNTER
If Japanese ministers wish to exercise their freedom of religion then there are plenty of other Shinto shrines that they could visit. Freedom of religion does not mean that politicians should be free to do as they wish knowing that it will insult others. The consequences of attempts to exercise freedom of religion in a volatile situation can be immense; Ariel Sharon’s visit to the Temple Mount while leader of the opposition was one of the sparks for the Al Aqsa Intifada.

# PRO03A-POINT
Is a domestic matter for each individual

The vast majority of members of the government when visiting Yasukuni do so only in a private capacity and not as representatives of the government. As private individuals in their own lives anyone should be allowed to visits any such sites they wish. Minister Keiji Furuya argues “Paying homage to the war dead is a purely domestic matter and it’s not for other countries to criticize us or intervene in these matters” and Prime Minister Abe agrees that it should not be a diplomatic issue “As for when I might go to Yasukuni Shrine, or whether I will go or not, I will not say as this should not become a political or diplomatic issue”. [1] That there has been controversy and criticism even when it clearly is a domestic private matter, such as former Republic of China (Taiwan) President Lee Teng-hui visiting the grave of his elder brother in 2007 shows that critics, in this case the People’s Republic of China, are simply interested in finding an opportunity to attack the Japanese government. [2]

# PRO03B-COUNTER
If ministers were visiting the shrine as part of their private lives then they should visit anonymously not publically as part of the large events at the shrine. If an individual is going under the glare of the media to take part in a formal event then it is clearly they are not doing so just for their own private and domestic reasons because it is a public event. As a public event then the position of the person in question becomes important.


# CON01A-POINT
Honouring war criminals is wrong

It is wrong to honour war criminals whose actions resulted in the deaths of thousands – or if you count the responsibility for the whole war in East Asia millions – of lives including the lives of Japanese citizens. The results were horrifying criminal acts. If Yasukuni is at all about remembrance then these individuals should not be enshrined and politicians certainly should not visit. Even Emperor Hirohito – Emperor during the Second World War – was opposed to their being enshrined. After the enshrinement of the war criminals in 1978 he stopped visiting the Yasukuni. He is quoted by Imperial Household Agency Grand Steward Tomohiko Tomita in his memoirs “At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including Matsuoka and Shiratori. I heard Tsukuba [the chief priest before the enshrinement] acted cautiously” However he questioned “What’s on the mind of Matsudaira’s son [the chief priest at the time of enshrinement], who is the current head priest? Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn’t know the parent’s heart. That’s why I have not visited the shrine since.” [1]

[1] ‘Hirohito visits to Yasukuni stopped over war criminals’, The Japan Times, 21 July 2006, http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/07/21/news/hirohito-visits-to-yasukuni-stopped-over-war-criminals/#.Ugz2DZKkrr4

# CON01B-COUNTER
Those going to Yasukuni are not going to honour the class A war criminals but the more than two million others who have given their lives for Japan. It is unfortunate that there are war criminals enshrined in the cemetery but it is wrong to conclude that because they are there those visiting must be visiting the war criminals.

# CON02A-POINT
Visits sour relations

The visits by senior Japanese politicians to Yasukuni are clearly a major issue in international politics that damages relations between Japan and its neighbours, particularly the People’s Republic of China and the two Koreas. Whenever ministers visit there is a round of recriminations this is often accompanies by cancelling discussions and visits as in april 2013 when South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung Se cancelled his visit. [1] South Korean President Park Geun-hye notes “If [Japan] does not have the courage to face its past and does not take an attitude of taking care of its partners’ pain, it will be difficult to establish trust to proceed toward the future.” [2] Diplomacy is about trust, Yasukuni undermines it.

Even attempts to minimise damage by sending representatives, as done by Prime Minister Abe in August 2013, does not help repair relations with China responding “It does not matter in what form or using what identity Japanese political leaders visit the Yasukuni Shrine, it is an intrinsic attempt to deny and beautify that history of invasion by the Japanese militarists”. [3] The only option is for all ministers to steer clear of the shrine and avoid sending offerings. It is not in Japan’s national interests for them to go.

# CON02B-COUNTER
The visits to the Yasukuni Shrine are mostly taken by the PR China and the Koreas as an opportunity to complain and bring up old wounds. Simply stopping visiting Yasukuni is not going to solve the fundamental problems in relations between these nations – disputes over Liancourt Rocks/Dokdo/Takeshima and Pinnacle Islands/Senkaku/Diaoyu or provide the demanded apologies over Japan’s World War II conduct which in any case when offered tends to be rejected as not enough. [1]

Ultimately foreign relations between nations do not have to be linked to history; many countries put conflicting pasts behind them. If the other countries of North East Asia wanted good relations with Japan they would simply ignore these visits.

# CON03A-POINT
Makes Japan look militaristic

Ministers and MPs visiting Yasukuni makes Japan look much more militaristic than it really is. There are two reasons for this. The first is the class A war criminals who should not be honoured as it appears to be honouring their militarism. The second is that Yasukuni itself has an overt political mission that essentially promotes such militarism. In the Yasukuni’s museum the Yashukan Japan’s wars are portrayed as wars of liberation from Western colonialism and fights against bandits and terrorists [1] – exactly the same justifications used in World War II itself. The museum, and its close ties with the shrine, display the unreconstructed view that Japan was the victim of the Second World War not the aggressor. When politicians visit the shrine they are showing their support for this interpretation. This could be solved by making the museum much more balanced; admitting that Japan started the wars they were involved in, information about the massacres such as at Nanjing, and about some of the other horrors perpetrated such as the ‘comfort women’ and unit 731.

# CON03B-COUNTER
It is silly to argue that visiting a shrine makes a country look militaristic. Of course in most cases militaristic symbolism and militarism goes hand in hand but this is not the case here. Japan by its actions is not militaristic and no amount of visits to shrines will make it so. Japan is committed to a pacifistic constitution; Article 9 states “Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.” [1] Despite flashpoints with all its neighbours only 25% of the Japanese public want to increase Japan’s defense capabilities – although this is rising. [2] It is notable that he Yashukan itself accepts that its position on the war is a challenge to the mainstream Japanese opinion. [3]

# CON04A-POINT
Separation of Church and State

In most modern democracies there is a strict separation of Church and State. This is the case in Japan just as in the United States of France. The constitution states “No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority” and bans the use of public money on any religious institution. [1] Lawmakers, and in particular cabinet ministers, visiting the Yasukuni shrine break this principle. [2] The constitutionality of visits has been challenged before and was ruled to be in violation of article 20 of the constitution (quoted above) by the Osaka High Court in September 2005. [3] Clearly no state should have senior members of the executive regularly breaking its own constitution.

# CON04B-COUNTER
The ruling in this case, as in others, was equivocal as it considered the problem to be that the visits by then Prime Minister Koizumi were in an official capacity. Koizumi put his name down as Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi which the court considered made it official. [1] If the visits had been considered to be in a private capacity it would have been ok. Most cabinet ministers when visit emphasize that they go in as private citizens not as state ministers.
