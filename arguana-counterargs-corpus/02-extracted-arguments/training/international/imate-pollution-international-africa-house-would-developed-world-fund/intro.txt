The latest report (fifth) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) put the blame for climate change firmly on humanity. The chair of the working group on Physical Science notes “We give very relevant guidance on the total amount of carbon that can't be emitted to stay to 1.5 or 2⁰C. We are not on the path that would lead us to respect that warming target” leading to the UN Secretary General stating “The heat is on. We must act.” [1] Past experience however shows they won’t.

The most obvious alternative is to accept that climate change is coming and to begin preparing for it. Adaptation is “Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.” [2] Adaptation is often thought of being purely physical; building higher sea walls and more resilient infrastructure. But it is much more than that including “diversification of livelihood activities, institutions both formal and informal, adjustments in farming operations… seasonal forecasts… having adequate grain reserves, weather insurance, food price subsidies” etc. This means that adaptation can mean anything from new methods of farming to migrating to areas that are going to see more, not less rainfall. [3]

However any such adaptation is going to be costly so the question of ‘who pays?’ is as prominent in adaptation as it was in reducing emissions. In the Doha summit of 2012 Prime Minister Hailemariam of Ethiopia pointed out that rather than new pledges “We are going to push especially for the powerful countries to implement previous decisions.” [4] The Green Climate Fund is supposed to receive $100billion per year by 2020 but funding is barely reaching $10billion per year. [5] There is no way to force countries to stump up funds to help others prevent the effects of climate change but should the developed world consider itself obliged to meet its obligations and fund adaptation, particularly for the poorest and hardest hit such as Africa?
