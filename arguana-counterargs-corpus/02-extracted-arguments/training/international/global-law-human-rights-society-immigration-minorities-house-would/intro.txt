In many Western countries, the topic of illegal immigrants sits high on the political agenda. This is the result of an increase in illegal immigrants residing in these countries, and the internal tensions that arise from these movements. As a response, countries such as the US, Canada and the EU have adopted repatriation policies for illegal immigrants. The policies are focused on voluntary repatriation, where an illegal immigrant gets the chance to decide for themselves to return to their country of origin, whilst receiving counselling aid and a free flight back. If this fails, involuntary repatriation can be considered 1. Proponents of repatriation insist a hard stance is necessary to deter future immigrants and reduce criminal activity. Opponents maintain however that the threat is overblown and that is both more expensive and dangerous to repatriate than to integrate illegal immigrants. This debate centres around the principles and practicalities of repatriating these immigrants. The motion of repatriating 'all' illegal immigrants in itself implies the inclusion of involuntary repatriation, since there are bound to be illegal immigrants that do not want to go back to their home country.
