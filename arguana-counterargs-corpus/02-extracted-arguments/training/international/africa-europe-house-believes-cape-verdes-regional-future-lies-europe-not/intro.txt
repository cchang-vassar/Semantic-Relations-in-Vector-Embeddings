Cape Verde [1] is an archipelago nation with a population of around half a million people 500km off the coast of West Africa [2] . Formerly a Portuguese colony, it gained independence from Portugal in 1975 - the year after the collapse of the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal. The independence movement, founded by Amilcar Cabral, a pan-Africanist, was linked to independence campaigns elsewhere in Africa, such as that of Guinea-Bissau [3] . Links between the two nations however weakened after Guinea-Bissau’s 1980 coup [4] . Cape Verde has had democratic elections since 1991, and is listed as having top scores and status as a "Model for political rights and civil liberties in Africa" according to Freedom House [5] . Other islands groups off the coast of North-West Africa include the Azores and Madeira, which remain part of Portugal, and the Canary Islands, which are an integral part of Spain.

Cape Verde has recently attempted to position itself towards Europe (an EU membership bid was mooted in 2005 [6] ), including a “Special Partnership” with the European Union which increases “cooperation at a political level and on security, regional integration, the knowledge-based society and poverty alleviation.” [7] If Cape Verde’s government is set on integration in to the European sphere, the ultimate goal would be membership of the European Union, the tight knit political and economic organization which contains 28 nations, covering much of the continent. Indeed, Cape Verde has changed its national flag to one featuring a ring of stars not dissimilar to that of the European Union. Cape Verde's currency, the Escudo, is pegged to the Euro.

Cape Verde is not the only nation separated from the main European continent which is a part of, or has attempted to join European organisations. Morocco applied to join the European Union in 1987, but was rejected, citing geographical reasons [8] . The Council of Europe counts Azerbaijan, in Central Asia, as one of its members [9] . On a sporting level, Israel’s national football and rugby teams have competed in European competitions for political reasons [10] , the state not being formally recognised by many other nations in Asia. Israel has been suggested as an EU member too, although a wide variety of issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict make membership unlikely.

[1] The official name used by the government in English is Cabo Verde, the Portuguese term for its name in English. However, as Cape Verde is more commonly used in English, this will be used throughout the debate.
