Ever since the beginning of an attempt at revolution in Syria which turned into a civil war from June 2011 Syria has become the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world. The war led to the formation of many rebel factions including what has become Daesh (Islamic State/ISIS). The conflict combined with the repressive policies of Daesh in the places they have conquered have resulted in more than 7 million people being internally displaced while close to half of the pre-war population of 23 million are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. [1] So far the United Nations has registered 4,718,230 refugees from Syria. [2] A refugee is someone who "owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country." [3] At the moment this would apply to anyone from Syria due to its state of civil war. Many of these refugees after years in camps on Syria’s borders are now giving up hope of a return to peace in Syria and are now looking to move elsewhere; particularly to Europe. However should the Gulf states being doing more to take in these refugees?
