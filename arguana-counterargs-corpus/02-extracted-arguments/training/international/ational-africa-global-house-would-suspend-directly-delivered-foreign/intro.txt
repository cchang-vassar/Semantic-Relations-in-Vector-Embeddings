In 2010, nearly $90bn in Official Development Assistance (ODA) aid will be given by the member nations of the UNâ€™s Development Assistance Committee (DAC). Payments of this type are transferred from the governments of donor states to the governments of the recipient states; approximately 70% of this funding will be ring-fenced (set aside) for development projects. By 2010 the overall ODA figure is estimated to rise to around $130bn. Long-term development aid consists of money, machinery, food resources and military equipment. It may also incorporate the provision of skills and education, by legal, technical and medical professionals.

This debate focuses on whether, instead of long-term government-to-government aid, World Bank aid and loans should be supplied to Non-governmental organisations such as Christian Aid, CARE, Anuragam and Engineers without borders, Private Voluntary Organisations and microcredit or microfinance institutions. Such aid models could include ring-fencing by nation, regional or purpose quotas and a need-based or competitive bidding allocation element. At the core of debates on this topic will be the effectiveness and efficiency of different aid delivery mechanisms.
