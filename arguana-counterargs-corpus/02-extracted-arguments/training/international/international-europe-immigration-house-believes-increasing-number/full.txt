# THESIS
This House Believes that the increasing number of immigrants in the EU does more harm than good.


# INTRO
The world is changing. People are migrating from one place to another. Countries in Europe, particularly the EU members, are also affected by this trend. There are many voices that claim the massive migration of people is very natural and beneficial for the EU, especially after easing the migration policy and opening labor market for people from the EU and also for people coming from other continents. On the other hand, there are people who do not believe these voices and they say that migration brings more harm than benefits. We cannot solve this problem without looking at both sides and their arguments. Therefore this debate thesis is set to look carefully into the issue of immigration and its impacts on the EU as a whole. I bet you have your own opinion but do not be narrow minded, open your mind think critically and then make a statement. Is immigration good? Is immigration bad? This debate will explore these issues.
