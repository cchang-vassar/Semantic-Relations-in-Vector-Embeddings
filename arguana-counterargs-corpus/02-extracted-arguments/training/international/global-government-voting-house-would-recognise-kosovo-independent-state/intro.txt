After NATO’s military action against Yugoslavia in 1999, an international mission administered Kosovo. The international mission was only a transition body and the exact future of Kosovo was deliberately left uncertain. Post-Milosevic Serbia has been keen to retain its sovereignty over the region but there was widespread support amongst Kosovo-Albanians for a fully sovereignty and independence, and Kosovo declared independence in 2008.

In 2010 the International Court of Justice ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence was within international law as international law contains no 'prohibition on declarations of independence according to state practice', [1] disappointing Serbia.

Since the unilateral action in 2008 Kosovo has been in a period of ‘supervised independence’ under an international steering group. The supervision is being lifted as Kosovo has, as of 7 th September, made all the constitutional changes the group feels necessary. This will mean that Kosovo will have full sovereignty for the first time without NATO or other international groupings making many decisions for it. [2]

As of 10 September 2012, the Republic of Kosovo has received 85 diplomatic recognitions as an independent state. Notably, 91 out of 193 (47.2%) United Nations member states, 22 out of 27 (81%) European Union member states, 24 out of 28 (86%) NATO member states, and 26 out of 57 (46%) member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have recognised Kosovo. Serbia refuses to recognise it as do Security Council members China and Russia. The Republic of Kosovo is a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. [3]

In countries which have already recognised Kosovo, this motion can either be run from the perspective of a hypothetical country that has not, or from the UN.
