African nations played a key role in the genesis of the International Criminal Court – indeed, the first state to ratify the Rome Statute was Senegal [1] . Five ICC judges, including the vice president, Sanji Mmasenono Monageng (who is from Botswana), are African, as is the current Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda (from The Gambia).

However, a chorus of disapproval has grown from members of the African Union (a grouping of the vast majority of African states) following a number of controversial indictments of African leaders. Omar al Bashir, president of Sudan is indicted by the ICC for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, but has not been captured for trial despite visiting a number of ICC member states, including some African states who have simply refused to hand him over. More recently, things came to a head over the ICC’s actions against the sitting president and vice president of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, over allegations of crimes against humanity in violence that followed on from the disputed 2009 Presidential election.

The idea of an African Criminal Court is not new, and was first mooted in 2004 [2] . In 2012, it was planned that the African Court of Justice and African Court on Human and People’s Rights , two courts run by the African Union that not all states have signed up to and have a low case load, merge in to one court which would also try criminal cases. However, few countries have signed or ratified the appropriate treaties and the courts being merged get little, if any, use [3] . This has not yet materialized.

A regional criminal court could cover either the three varieties of crime covered by the ICC – genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity – or a broader pool, possibly including drug trafficking, coups and/or corruption.
