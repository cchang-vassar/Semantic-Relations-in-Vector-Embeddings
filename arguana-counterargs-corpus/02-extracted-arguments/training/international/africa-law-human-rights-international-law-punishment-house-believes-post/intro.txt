Balancing peace and justice has been a key moral issue for international criminal law. Should individuals always be prosecuted, or can justice be traded away for peace? Is it merely a chicken-or-egg scenario, therefore which, if any, has to come first?

The prototypical implementation of the “justice” model is the Nuremberg trials following the Second World War. Leading Nazis (as were leading members of the Imperial Japanese regime, in separate trials held in Tokyo) were prosecuted by a court comprised of judges from the Allied nations in the war. Most tried were convicted, and executed by hanging.

Following the collapse of the Apartheid regime in South Africa, a different route was taken. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up. It provided a manner for those who were accused of human rights violations to seek amnesties if they told the whole truth about their crimes and asked for forgiveness. The commission had members from all sides of the divides in South Africa, and was chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The TRC is not without its critics, including for those who described it having failed to put criminals on trial. That said, others have claimed that those criticisms exist due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the commissions [1] .

In 2013 the ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, said the court “cannot take in to consideration the interests of peace, which is the mandate of other institutions, such as the United Nations Security Council [2] ” – in other words, that the ICC rejects a peace-justice trade, mirroring the general direction of the UN [3] .

In 2013, the UN General Assembly organized a “thematic debate on the role of international criminal justice”, under the presidency of the Serbian government. It was boycotted by the USA, Canada and Jordan, and seen by many as a cheap shot at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [4] .

Peace and justice may mean different things to different people, and different people will have different goals. But is justice necessary in order to maintain a long-lasting peace?
