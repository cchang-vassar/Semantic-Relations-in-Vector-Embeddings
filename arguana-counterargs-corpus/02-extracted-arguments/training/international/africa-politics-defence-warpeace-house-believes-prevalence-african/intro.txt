Mercenaries, or dogs of war as they are popularly known, are defined by the UN as combatants who are ‘motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party to the conflict, material compensation’ [1] . The first accounted use of such forces was by Pharaoh Ramesses II in ancient Egypt, who employed roughly 11,000 mercenaries in the 13th Century BCE. Throughout the middle ages, mercenaries became prominent throughout Italy where they were used by the city states to conduct their small scale conflicts.

The use of hired soldiers continued in to the second half of the twentieth century where the African continent became a popular destination for those seeking well paid military work. Post-independent Africa witnessed numerous inter-state and civil wars which created the opportunity for mercenaries to make use of their skill set. The Congo conflict in the 1960s saw mercenaries being hired by all sides of the conflict, setting the tone for the next forty years. The end of the apartheid was another notable event for mercenary activity. When racial-segregation ended in South Africa there were many white citizens who left the army. Their professional skill set saw them employed throughout the conflicts on the 1990s, including Sierra Leone. Companies such as Executive Outcomes made significant profits off of these wars.

Since the 1980s however, states and international institutions have placed increasingly high restrictions on mercenaries. The 1989 UN Mercenary Convention outlawed the practice, with other states creating their own legislation to prevent their citizens from becoming hired guns. With the decreasing instability of Africa and competing actors, do mercenaries still have a place?
