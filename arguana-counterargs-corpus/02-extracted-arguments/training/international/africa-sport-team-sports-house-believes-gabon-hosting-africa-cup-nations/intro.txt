In 2012, Gabon, along with Equatorial Guinea, hosted the Africa Cup of Nations, the primary international football competition in Africa. Both nations held an equal number of matches, with Gabon holding the final, and Equatorial Guinea the bronze medal match and opening game. These two relatively small countries (Equatorial Guinea with a population under one million, and Gabon under two million) hosted the tournament for the first time, previous host nations including Angola (whose tournament in 2010 was marred by the attack on the bus carrying the Togo team to Cabinda), Ghana and Egypt. Gabon, whose share of matches included the final, was perhaps more of a sporting success than imagined: both host nations reached the quarter finals. A number of key African footballing powerhouses, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Cameroon and Algeria failed to qualify. The two nations were selected as hosts in 2006.

High profile sporting events are always controversial because of their expense and the coverage they bring if nothing else. While not on the same scale as the Olympic Games or the World Cup (which has been hosted within Africa: South Africa in 2010), the Africa Cup of Nations is the most high profile truly African event, not only receiving extensive coverage within the continent but also outside the region, including in the UK [1] . While both countries are of medium development as per (non inequality adjusted) UN Human Development Index figures, a particular focus was put on the human rights record on both nations, in particular that of Gabon’s co-hosts, Equatorial Guinea [2] .
