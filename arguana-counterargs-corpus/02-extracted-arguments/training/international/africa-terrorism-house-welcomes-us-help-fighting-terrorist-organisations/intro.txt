A terrorist organisation is defined by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as a group which will ‘intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act’ and create a state of ‘terror’ [1] . Since the 1990s there has been a notable rise in Islamic extremism, which led the United States to call for a ‘War on Terror’ in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. This brought about a concerted effort by the United States to remove terrorist groups from the African continent [2] .

In 2002 the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) was established, eventually turning into African Command (AFRICOM). This marked the United States’ largest military presence on the continent since Operation Restore Hope in Somalia in 1993 [3] . As well as providing direct counter-terrorist military support, AFRICOM and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have provided equipment, vehicles, and logistical and training support. This help is to ensure that African states are capable of deterring terrorism within their own lands and ensure stability on the continent [4] .

This debate is focused around whether or not this assistance has been more of a help or a hindrance for Africa in the face of the continent’s major challenges.
