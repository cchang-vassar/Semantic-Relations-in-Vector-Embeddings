The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) won the Nobel prize for peace on the 11 th October 2013 “for its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons”. The Nobel prize committee argued “Recent events in Syria, where chemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to enhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.” [1] Yet this was only just over a week after the OPCW started in its efforts to disarm Syria’s chemical weapons, a mission that will almost certainly prove to be the organisation’s biggest test. And only a couple of months after the first confirmed chemical weapons attack since the chemical weapons convention came into effect in 1997.

The weapons inspectors are only in Syria as a result of a last minute deal between the great powers of Russia and the United States as a way to avoid a bombing campaign by the Americans and French. The United States attempts to create a coalition to bomb Syria were already stumbling when Secretary of State John Kerry in a news conference in London responded to how war could be averted with "[Assad] could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week …. But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done." [2] The Russians took this as an opening to suggest putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control which the Syrian government quickly accepted with foreign minister Walid al-Moallem saying "Syria welcomes the Russian proposal out of concern for the lives of the Syrian people, the security of our country and because it believes in the wisdom of the Russian leadership that seeks to avert American aggression against our people." [3]

The result was a framework agreed between Russia and the United States on the 14 th September whereby Syria would agree to the destruction of all chemical agents and related equipment with the monitoring of the OPCW. A rough timeline was also decided “A. Completion of initial OPCW on-site inspections by November. B. Destruction of production and mixing/filling equipment by November. C. Complete elimination of all chemical weapons material and equipment in the first half of 2014.” [4]

On the same day Syria joined the Chemical Weapons convention, provisionally applying it until its entry into force on the 14 th October 2013 [5] which allowed the weapons inspectors to begin their work of first compiling and then destroying Syria's stockpile of WMD.

There was an initial deadline for the handover by 6 th February. This was however not met resulting in negotiations on a new date and a new deadline of the 13 th April, a deadline that may well be missed but probably not by much. [6] However even if the deadlines are met there will remain questions about whether the inspectors have been beneficial as the war has raged around them. And whether Assad has really given up all of his Weapons of Mass Destruction.
