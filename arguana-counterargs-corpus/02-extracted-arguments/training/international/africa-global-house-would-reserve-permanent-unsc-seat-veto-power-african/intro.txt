The United Nations Security Council could be considered to be the highest body in the world; it is the only body with some responsibility, and the capability to act, on security issues anywhere in the world. Momentarily, there are 5 permanent members in the UNSC, namely US, China, Russia, France and UK who have a veto against any resolution before the UNSC. Additionally there are 10 non-permanent members who are chosen on geographic criteria. The African bloc currently has three non-permanent members that are chosen from within the region by elections. Non-permanent members however don’t have the power to veto so must rely on building coalitions within the council. As they are rotating no country can ensure they maintain a lasting influence at the UNSC level.

The UNSC was set up in the wake of the Second World War; the veto wielding members are the five main allies who won that war. They also cemented their status by being the first to build nuclear weapons. However by the 1990s Germany and Japan were, apart from the US, the powers that paid most towards the UN and argued this should entitle them to a permanent seat. Reform has since been very much on the cards but how, and who should get membership?

The African states have their own views on the issue. In 1997 [1] and again in 2005 the African Union agreed to support “Full representation of Africa in the Security Council means: i. not less than two permanent seats with all the prerogatives and privileges of permanent membership including the right of veto; ii. five non-permanent seats”. [2] This proposal clearly represents a demand for a much expanded Security Council. Permanent membership with veto is at the heart of their demands – their alternative is abolishing the veto altogether. [3]
