The European Union (EU) currently has 27 member countries, twelve of which have joined since the new millennium. Since this large expansion further expansion, with the exception of debates over Turkey, has been a much smaller issue. The European Union has offered the prospect of membership in the EU to nine countries; Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, former Yugoslav Republic of (FYRO) Macedonia, Iceland, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey. Of these five, Croatia, FYRO Macedonia, Iceland, Montenegro, and Turkey, have been granted official candidate status. However negotiations have only opened with Croatia, Iceland and Turkey. [1]

However the European Union itself is in crisis. Since the financial crisis in 2008 the periphery of Europe has been running in to financial problems. Greece, Ireland and Portugal within the core group in the Euro single currency have been bailed out and there are still worries that much larger economies like Spain or Italy may at some point also need a bailout. Already there have been other EU states that are non-members of the Euro that have also been bailed out such as Hungary which was bailed out by the EU and International Monetary Fund in 2008. As a result Europe has little money or time left over for considering further expansion, does it really want to be expanding when there is crisis at home?

None the less the question of expansion of the European Union remains important in the long term. Many European countries have declining populations or soon will have so new workers are needed. Expansion is at the heart of the European project – there has always been a drive to either make Europe deeper or broader. The criteria for membership are simple and would eventually allow for quite a lot more expansion eastwards. Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union makes the EUs founding principles “of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law” the main criteria along with being a European country. [2] This was reaffirmed and expanded upon in the Copenhagen Criteria of 1993 that required a candidate to have

1, stable institutions that guarantee democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;

2, a functioning market economy, as well as the ability to cope with the pressure of competition and the market forces at work inside the Union;

3, the ability to assume the obligations of membership, in particular adherence to the objectives of political, economic and monetary union.

Once states have passed these criteria then they need to go through an accession process in which the candidate country implements EU legislation and puts EU rules and procedures in place. [3]

Note: There is another debate about whether Turkey should join . The points in this debate will however remain broadly relevant for it as well.
