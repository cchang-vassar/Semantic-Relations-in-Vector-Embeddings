During one of the democratic primary debates leading up the 2008 presidential election, then Senator Barack Obama was asked whether he would meet with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and Cuba, without preconditions. Obama said that “I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this [the Bush] administration – is ridiculous.” His response drew criticisms from foreign policy commentators and political opponents, with Hillary Clinton deeming his response “irresponsible and naïve. [1] ” Others, however, hailed it as the advent of a new foreign policy of engagement, in stark contrast to what they saw as the diplomatic failure of the Bush years. Although President Obama has yet to sit down with any of the aforementioned leaders, he did reiterate his willingness to do so after he took office. [2] Should President Obama pursue this approach in his relations with “rogue nations”, or should preconditions be essential in earning them a spot at the negotiating table? With Iran allegedly developing nuclear weapons, Syria in turmoil, and nuclear North Korea experiencing a change in leadership, the answer to these questions is of the utmost importance for US foreign policy.
