We are increasingly warned that there is no single story. Narratives are dangerous, and recognition is required on the complex, dynamic experiences, and perspectives, of daily life. This debate focuses on whether Africa’s rising cultural industry provides an opportunity to rewrite Africa’s narrative.

The colonial ‘scramble for Africa’ embedded images of Africa within constructed notions of race. Further, contemporary realities characterise Africa as a continent trapped, poor, and desperate. Jeremy Sachs suggests African nations are living within a ‘poverty trap’. Media, discourse, and imagery conjure paradoxical images of a society needing ‘saving’ on the one hand, and a barren, deserted land on another hand. Stereotypical stories are becoming utilised on a daily basis without critical reflection. As the Foucauldian study of discourse shows, power is intrinsically connected to language; thus society.

The cultural industry in Africa is now creating a new platform to voice opinion and showcase the daily issues experienced by people in Africa. Whether through music, film, art, and fashion, there is a rise in African artists who are aim to change global perceptions of Africa. Nollywood has received increasing attention - a flourishing film industry, Nollywood arose as an entrepreneurial project; and has now become a leading low-budget film industry, with the films screened globally and online. Nollywood has grown to become Nigeria’s second largest employer, and creates an estimated $590mn in annual revenues (Moudio, 2013). However, is Nollywood changing western perspectives or just an emerging gold mine for the talented and beautiful? Kwame Nkrumah, former President of Ghana, once said “when the music changes, so does the dance”. Therefore is Nollywood a sign the music is changing for, and in, Africa?
