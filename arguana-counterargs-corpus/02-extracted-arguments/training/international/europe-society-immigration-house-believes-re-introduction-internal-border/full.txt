# THESIS
This House believes that the re-introduction of internal border controls in the Schengen area was a wrong step


# INTRO
The Schengen area represents a territory where the free movement of persons is guaranteed. The signatory states to the agreement have abolished all internal borders in lieu of a single external border. Here common rules and procedures are applied with regard to visas for short stays, asylum requests and border controls. [1] Freedom of movement is considered to be one of the basic pillars of the European Union and a victory of the integration process. Nonetheless, restrictions have been recently agreed upon. The agreement amongst the EU home affairs ministers at the Council of the European Union meeting in June enables the member states to re-introduce internal border controls.
