Security is not at the heart of the debate about leaving the EU, that is undoubtedly economics, nor is it the issue of most sentimental concern, that would be sovereignty and identity. While it may not be the deciding issue for many it is still an important issue in the referendum. People are unlikely to vote to leave if they believe that Britain will be less secure as a result. The majority of Britons (between 48 and 55%) believe that staying in or leaving the EU will make no difference to the risk of terrorism. [1] With such a large number believing it will make no difference there is lots of room for both campaigns to create a shift in opinion.

There are a large number of factors involved in security. It is tied up with migration through border controls and the possibility of migrants being terrorists attempting to get into the country. It is also tied up with Britain’s place in the world; will the UK be cooperating as closely with its neighbours? And it is tied into the economy as the size of the economy and tax receipts help determine the size of the military and amount that can be spent on security.

As with all such debates there is much hyperbole on both sides. David Cameron has stated “Can we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking? I would never be so rash as to make that assumption” potentially implying that there may be war if Britain leaves the EU. [2] A bit of a stretch though instability is certainly very plausible. On the other side saying “What held war at bay was, rather, NATO,” [3] essentially the military, and ignoring the softer European pull factors keeping the peace within the EU, as well as any non military security issues such as humanitarian issues or the environment, is almost equally hard to take seriously. It is however such divergent opinions that makes the debate particularly important.

[1] And added to this can be the 14-20% don’t knows’ to make 62-75%.
