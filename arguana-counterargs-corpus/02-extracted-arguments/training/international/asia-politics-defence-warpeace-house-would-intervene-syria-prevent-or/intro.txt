In Syria there have now been almost two years of conflict between the Ba’ath Party of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a fractured Arab spring inspired rebellion that incorporates a broad Syrian National Coalition, Kurds and Mujahideen from around the Middle East. It is now clear that intervention from outside the country, beyond the provision of weapons, will only happen if there is a major change in the situation on the ground. NATO and the United States have shown little inclination to intervene in any capacity on their own while Russia and China prevent any UN action that they believe might be opening the way to overthrowing President Assad’s regime.

The United States however says that it does have red lines, which if crossed, will result in more US action. In August Obama stated “We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.” [1] Chemical weapons are about the last possible line that has yet to be crossed in the brutal civil war where the United Nations estimates 60,000 people have died. [2]

There are of course significant difficulties with the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government being a red line that triggers intervention or some other form of reaction; most particularly how do we know when they are used? The use of chemical weapons my not be easy to spot from a satellite, and reports from either side on the ground would be inevitably biased if there are to be such consequences. This question is important because there are accusations that chemical weapons have been used already. The US consul general in Istanbul has sent the State Department a report that states "We can't definitely say 100 percent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 was used in Homs on Dec. 23". The accusation is that a chemical weapon called Agent 15 was used. As chemical weapons go this is not a particularly nasty one; the attack caused five deaths and about 100 severe respiratory, nervous system, and gastrointestinal ailments. [3] The number of deaths however is not particularly relevant if it means stepping over US red lines.

The State department however says “we believe Syria's chemical weapons stockpile remains secured by the Syrian government” and that they “found no credible evidence to corroborate or to confirm that chemical weapons were used” so for the moment we still do not know if chemical weapons have been used or not. [4]

Either way the international community must be considering what it will do if it becomes clear that Chemical weapons have been used or if they are used more widely. Syria is thought to have one of the biggest Chemical Weapons arsenals in the world and may well also have biological weapons. It probably has large quantities of VX and had before the start of the civil war at least four large chemical weapons production facilities. [5]

If chemical weapons are going to be used, or have been used, should there be intervention?
