In many ways this debate is far more about the UN than about Palestine. The central hub of the issue is simply this – there are many nations that are not states in the world and a handful of states that are not nations, which ones should the UN allow to have representatives within the general Assembly? For Opposition speakers this will be a recurring theme. Many people might want certain nations to be recognised as states (Scotland leaps to mind) but the UN reflects reality not aspiration. It may be worth noting that Taiwan (Republic of China), rather than China (People’s Republic of China), was the founder signatory of the UN charter and yet it is China that sits on the security council.

The United Nations has always been two things at the same time; an aspirational declaration of what the world should be and a forum for the discussion of where it is. This tension has been the cause of much difficulty since its inception. Everyone from renegade bandits to freedom fighters and squatters to revolutionaries have argued that they should be recognised by the UN, they have been mostly ignored.

Palestine is an interesting case because, as Mahmood Abbas has pointed out, the existence of Palestine is acknowledged by the UN in its 1947 declaration which portioned the territory into two states [i] . In addition to which much of the world considers Palestine to be a state, 122 general assembly members have recognised Palestine, [ii] and it functions very much like one with a government and ethnic, racial and religious identity.
