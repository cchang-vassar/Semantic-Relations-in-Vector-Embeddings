For its size and wealth North Korea gets a lot of international attention. It regularly gets into the media around the world and is the subject of numerous high powered rounds of talks and discussions in the Security Council. Yet despite all the attention North Korea gets from the press, diplomats, and policymakers North Korea also regularly seems to get its own way in negotiations and its on-going brinkmanship with the rest of the world despite the obvious disparities between the North Korean state and even its southern adversary let along the United States.

North Korea, formally the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, occupies the northern half of the Korean Peninsula which was divided at the 38 th parallel at the end of the Second World War with the northern half administered by the Soviet Union while the south was administered by the United States. The Soviet Union handed over control to the Democratic People’s Republic in 1948. War between the two Koreas in the early 1950s did not resolve the split and today Korea is one of the few areas where the Cold War continues.

North Korea is small, at 120,000km 2 slightly smaller than the US state of Mississippi, is mostly mountainous, has a relatively small population of 24.5 million people who are extremely poor with GDP per capita at purchasing power parity of $1,800. [1] The attention this country gets is therefore completely out of proportion with the importance that would normally be given a country of similar size and wealth, for example Cambodia. [2] North Korea’s influence comes from several factors;

Its strategic location as both buffer zone and potentially a bridge between three great powers – Japan, China, and Russia. [3] The United States is also closely interested as a result of alliances with Japan and South Korea

As a country building a nuclear weapons capability

Being the most militarised country on earth – with the potential to cause huge casualties as a result of being in artillery range of South Korea’s capital Seoul. [4]

North and South Korea having never agreed a peace treaty and having huge military forces along the border between them meaning even small incidents could blow up into a large scale conventional war.

Should the great powers in the region simply ignore the regime and continue business as usual when these intermittent provocations occur?
