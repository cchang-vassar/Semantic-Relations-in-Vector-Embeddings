On Thursday 18 September 2014 people in Scotland will vote on the question 'Should Scotland be an independent country'. [1] What Scotland's relationship with Europe will be in one, five or ten years after the referendum is unclear.

A Scot voting no (to remain in the UK) could not be sure that Scotland will be in the EU in a decade because of the possibility of a UK referendum on leaving the EU. In January 2011 the coalition government passed a bill that implemented a 'referendum lock' which would require a UK referendum on the EU if there were any major treaty changes. [2] This lock is currently the only legislation for a referendum. However, in January 2013 David Cameron promised an in/out EU referendum by the end of 2017 if he won the next general election. [3] Despite this commitment Tory Eurosceptics regretted the lack of an EU referendum in the Queen's speech and so put forward their own referendum bill which is going through the Commons to guarantee a vote, at the time of writing it looks likely to pass (and then get savaged in the House of Lords which however cant stop the Commons passing it). [4] Therefore a referendum on staying in or leaving the EU looks likely within the next five years or so.

A Scot voting yes (to create an independent Scotland) would be equally unsure of the implications of their choice. Scotland's relationship with the EU in the event of independence is a hotly contested issue which the subject of the debate, the EU itself, has done little to clarify. Nothing in the EU treaties deals with what would happen should a region within the EU become independent. [5] Whether Scotland is regarded as a continuing state or a new state affects whether it would remain in the EU or would have to apply for membership. The commission has implied it would have to apply for membership and this raises the possibility that Scotland would at least temporarily leave the EU following independence.

Certainly there would be much more clarity to a vote on Scottish independence if Scottish voters knew whether they were voting to remain part of a UK within the EU or one that would not be, rather than voting not knowing if they would be ejected from the EU against their will a few years down the line. This argument has been made by those in favour of an early EU referendum but is now certain not to happen. [6]
