Sanctions are coercive or punitive actions taken on specific states. Sanctions range from diplomatic sanctions, which often result in the closing of embassies, to military sanctions, which can include intervention, and economic sanctions, which limit sectors of the target state's economy. Trade sanctions are typically imposed by either one country (unilateral) or a group of countries (multilateral) to limit their trade of certain products with another country. Often sanctions are used in international politics in an effort to push countries towards, or away from, specific actions. The use of sanctions is a long standing debate in the field of international politics. It centers on the idea of democracy promotion and whether it is just to punish countries that violate the human rights of their citizens or stray from democratic principles. Further, it is questioned whether sanctions are in fact the best way to ensure democratic development, or if incentives, like free trade, are more effective. It is embodied by the expression "the carrot or the stick;" incentives, or punishment. This case is generic and the arguments are broadly applicable to numerous examples: US policy towards Cuba and Haiti, Iraq and the UN, Myanmar and the West, China and the WTO, South African and the end of apartheid, Turkey and the EU and Pakistan and the Commonwealth. Note the range of scenarios covered in this case.
