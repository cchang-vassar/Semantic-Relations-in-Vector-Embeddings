The International Criminal Court (ICC) began in 2002, formed under the Rome Statute to try the most serious of war crimes when sovereign nations are not in a position to do so themselves. The ICC is an independent international organisation, outside of the United Nations system, and runs on funding from state parties. In order to be able to prosecute people involved in conflict, the ICC needs to have a referral either from the country central to the conflict, by the United Nations Security Council (being made up by the US, France, Russia, China and the UK), or prosecutors can seek leave to charge leaders themselves. Currently, every referral to the court except one (and the only conviction to date) has been African. The African Union (AU) has consistently criticized a ‘bias’ within the ICC unfairly targeting African countries. In January 2014 the organisation sent a letter to the ICC highlighting “processes and procedures of the ICC” one of the criticisms is the ICC acts “without garnering the cooperation necessary to ensure the integrity of the proceedings”. [1] In individual statements African governments go further; Ethiopia’s foreign minister Tedros Adhanom has said the ICC’s “unfair treatment of Africa and Africans leaves much to be desired” [2] and his Kenyan counterpart Amina Mohamed accuses the ICC of “treating us like toddlers”. [3] So the question becomes: is the ICC biased against Africa?
