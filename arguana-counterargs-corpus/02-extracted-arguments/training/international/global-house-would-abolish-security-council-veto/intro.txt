The United Nations was established in 1945 by means of the Charter of the United Nations. The membership of the organisation currently comprises almost every recognised state in the world. Every member state is represented in the General Assembly where it holds a single vote. This forum holds debates on any matter within the scope of the Charter and passes decisions by a simple majority or exceptionally a two thirds majority of members present and voting. Under article 24 of the Charter, the Security Council has primary responsibility for "the maintenance of international peace and security". This mandate includes the authorisation of the use of force for purposes other than self-defence. This body includes 5 permanent members or the P5; the United States, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia. In addition, 10 seats on the Security Council are held by non-permanent member states that are elected for a term of 2 years. Although decisions of the Security Council are made by the affirmative vote of 9 of the 15 members, the P5 hold the power of veto over any such decision. Proponents of its removal argue that the conditions under which the P5 were granted their veto power are now out-dated and unfair whilst opponents maintain that it is a necessary element in the maintenance of international peace and security.
