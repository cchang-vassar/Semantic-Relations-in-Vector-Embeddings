The European Union (EU) has twenty-seven Member States and a further five are standing as candidates to be granted Union access. There is a wealth of different cultures and languages contained within the Union. Currently, the two official languages of the EU are English and French; These are the languages through which the EU conducts all its conferences and in which it publishes all its official reportage. German also has a strong presence in the EU insofar as many MEP (Members of European Parliament) are able to speak it. In short, the EU chooses to operate through the mediums of English and French. The French have expressed a desire for their language to have a higher profile in the Unionâ€™s activities. Is it more beneficial to embrace and respect all the languages and to allow all EU communication to be conducted through a variety of languages, or to insist on one single language as the medium of communication?

The proposal is that English should become the single working language of the EU.
