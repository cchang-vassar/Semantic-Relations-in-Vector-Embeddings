The war in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been called ‘Africa’s first world war’. DR Congo is a vast country in Central Africa, often mentioned as being ‘the size of Western Europe’ torn by civil war and subject to repeated intervention by neighbouring states in the period 1997-2003. It has really been a succession of wars with the First Congo war being fought to overthrow the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1996/7. A Second war involving Angola, Chad, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi, as well as possibly Sudan, and about 20 different armed groups lasted from 1998 to 2003. There have also been several ongoing conflicts that have not yet fully ended; one comparatively minor conflict in the North West at Dongo and another in the west in Kivu. The total number of deaths was estimated as being at least 3.5 million in 2006 [1] while in 2008 it was being reported that the conflict was continuing to kill about 45,000 each month, mostly children. [2]

As a conflict that has been ongoing for such a long time the Congolese wars have been a severe test for the United Nations and its peacekeeping system as they have clearly failed in either creating, or keeping the peace. The mandate of the UN mission has changed more than six times since November 1999 while trying to match political aims with the needs on the ground. The mission now has slightly over 20 000 troops, close to the total authorised in 2013 of 22,000, [3] but this force is trying to police a huge area. It also has a diverse mission to provide stability, protection for civilians and to support “the consolidation of State authority throughout the territory”.

It now seems that the United Nations may be on the brink of success. Peacekeepers usually stand back and attempt to keep the peace, they are not meant to go on the offensive, although they will fight back if fired on, however this changed in early 2013. UN Security Council Resolution 2098 “Decides to extend the mandate of MONUSCO in the DRC until 31 March 2014, [to] include an “Intervention Brigade”… with the responsibility of neutralizing armed groups… and the objective of contributing to reducing the threat posed by armed groups to state authority and civilian security in eastern DRC and to make space for stabilization activities”. [4] The UN was for the first time to go on the offensive.

Now it seems that this might have been a successful strategy. The rebel group that the UN and the Congolese army were targeting is M23, the biggest remaining rebel force who succeeded in taking the city of Goma in November 2012, which the government now claims they have defeated. A Government spokesperson has said "We can say that it's finished. But you never know. Those who escaped can come with hit-and-run operations so we have to end everything politically so that we are sure our people can sleep quietly without any threat." M23 has said that it will now adopt “purely political means” to achieve its goals. This gives the government the opportunity to demand that other groups give up – and threaten to disarm them by force if they don’t. [5]

The US special envoy, Russell Feingold, says “In a region that has suffered so much, this is obviously a significant positive step in the right direction.” [6] But will it actually be the end? Clearly there are more rebels in Eastern Congo and Feingold himself is suggesting that the next target should be the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and we have seen before that conflict can flare up again in this volatile country.

Even if the conflict has been won it can be questioned whether the UN mission has been a success. Success means more than just defeating a rebellion in battle; it also has to mean creating a sustainable climate that will enable peace to continue and the UN mission to be withdrawn.
