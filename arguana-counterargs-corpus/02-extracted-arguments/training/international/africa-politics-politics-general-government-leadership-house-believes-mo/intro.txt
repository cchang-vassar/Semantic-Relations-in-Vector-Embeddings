A fundamental point within Acemoglu and Robinson’s (2013) Why Nations Fail is that the prosperity of a nation relies upon an effective power structure. Political institutions need to be democratic, reasonably centralised, accountable, and inclusive, for prosperity to be found and sustained - much of which is not found within African nation-states. Good governance is fundamental for the developmental prosperity of nations.

The Mo Ibrahim Prize was first established in 2007, and the prize represents a celebration of excellent African leadership. The prize is awarded to a former head of state, or government, for their positive work in enabling the prosperity of their nation, tackling poverty, and sustaining an equitable path of development. The former head of state or government has to have left office within the last three years, have been democratically elected and completed their term, and shown ‘exceptional’ leadership. The prize has two crucial features: celebrating political governance in Africa and identifying role models within the continent. The prize includes $5mn over ten years and then $200,000 per year for life - the largest annual fund. Previous winners include President Nelson Mandela (Honorary) and Joaquim Chassano (2007); President Festus Mogae (2008), and President Pedro Pires (2011) (Mo Ibrahim Foundation, 2013). However, with the prize criteria regularly not being fulfilled, since its establishment in 2007 the prize has remained unclaimed for 3 years - 2009, 2012, and recently 2013. To what extent can the denial of the prize be justified? Does it act to incentivise African leaders to follow good governance?
