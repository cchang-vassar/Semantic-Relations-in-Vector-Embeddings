The issue of sex offenders is always a sensitive one, and the popular pressure this places on the Government often leads to the adoption of measures intended to help people protect themselves against any previous offenders who live locally. In the USA, this pressure reached its peak after the murder of a 7 year old girl by a man with previous convictions for sexual offences, who lived close to her without the family's knowledge. Some states introduced measures in the aftermath, which became known as Megan's Law. The federal version (Sexual Offender (Jacob Wetterling) Act of 1994) requires sex offenders to register where they live and notify the police if they move, and requires police to release this information if there is a danger to the public. A less stringent measure is in place in the UK where most sex offenders are placed on the Violent and Sex Offenders Register, with the same requirements of notification of address, but no discretion to disclose this to the public. Some states, such as New Jersey, act more stringently in their disclosure, choosing to frequently release the offender's name, address, picture, and offence committed.

This motion goes beyond these stances, suggesting an active publication of this information even where there is little, or minimal, threat to the public. It also suggests doing it in a way designed to cause embarrassment to the offenders.
