We all want and should eat better. And each of us has different definitions and priorities when it comes to “good food”.

For some good equals healthy, low in fat and sugar. Not at all a bad idea in a world with more than 1 billion overweight and 300 million obese individuals where energy-dense, fat and sugar laden food takes most of the blame. [1]

For others the goal is to eat sustainably and for many that means eating food that was produced locally. Kaiser Permamente discovered that it can reduce its carbon footprint by more than 17 percent by using local produce in their menus. [2]

This could also mean eating food that is ‘fair trade’ that makes sure that a decent amount of the money spent by the consumer goes to the farmer who produces the food.

Lastly, and perhaps most controversially, some will refuse to eat genetically modified food, for fears they’re both unhealthy and unsustainable. [3]

Underlying all those very diverse goals is labeling – specifically labeling food products with their fat and sugar content, origin, way of production and possibly GMO content. But is this really a way to give the consumer the information she needs to reach her goals of health, sustainability and advocacy or will labeling foods fall short of its promise, leaving tax payers and companies to pay for the failed experiment?

Because this is such a broad topic, we’ll be looking at the combined issues of different labeling schemes, focusing on the GDA-system and the traffic light system, which have been introduced in the UK [4] and elsewhere in the EU [5] and labeling foods containing GMOs, allowed on a voluntary basis in the US [6] . Thus the government in today’s debate stands for all sorts of food labeling: all contents, GDA and traffic lights, origin and GMO content.
