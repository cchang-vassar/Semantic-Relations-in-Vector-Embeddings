Trans fat is the common name for unsaturated fat with trans-isomer (E-isomer) fatty acid(s). It can be found in Oreos, cup-cakes, french fries, deep-fried dishes, croissants, and other foods. It is so unhealthy for individuals that many legislators have proposed and executed bans on the use of trans fats in restaurants, and in some cases in commercially available grocery goods and foodstuffs as well.

New York City was the first US city to have successfully banned trans fats in December of 2006. Philadelphia followed in October of 2007. San Francisco, Seattle, and Chicago have all passed similar bans or limitations since. Many other legislatures in the US are pursuing bans. Denmark was the first country to effectively ban trans fats in 2003, with Switzerland following in 2009. The debate continues in many other countries and localities.

While many believe that the world might be healthier without the trans-isomer fats, others contend that trans fats have a particularly delicious taste, and serve the functional purpose of extending the shelf-life of foods. Opponents of a ban also criticize efforts by the government to protect consumers by limiting their choices, calling this "infantilization" and "nannying." But supporters respond that trans fats are so widespread in restaurants and products (often without labelling) that consumers really don't have an informed "choice" in consuming the fat. And while many argue that banning trans fats is like trying to ban tobacco or alcohol, supporters respond that trans fats are only an ingredient (not a whole product category) for which there are replacement ingredients that can maintain the taste and quality of the final food products.
