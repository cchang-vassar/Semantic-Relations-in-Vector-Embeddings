“One hundred years ago, children received 1 vaccine (the smallpox vaccine). Forty years ago, children received 5 vaccines routinely (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and smallpox vaccines) and as many as 8 shots by 2 years of age. Today, children receive 11 vaccines routinely and as many as 20 shots by 2 years of age,” the American Academy of Pediatrics states. [1]

The rising number of vaccinations given to children has raised concerns of parents. As a consequence of these trends, recent national surveys (from 2002) found that 23% of parents questioned the number of shots recommended for their children, and 25% were concerned that vaccines might weaken the immune system. [2]

Their fears have then been fueled even more since the British Doctor Andrew Wakefield published an article, since discredited, in The Lancet in which he described several children who developed signs of autism and intestinal symptoms following their MMR immunization. MMR is the combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. It is given as a combined vaccine because separately they would require six injections in total, meaning that there could be a longer delay before the child was fully vaccinated, leaving them at risk [3] . Since its introduction, the number of children who catch these diseases has fallen to an all-time low [4] . Dr. Wakefield’s conclusion, however, was that the vaccine inflamed the disease in a manner that allowed an unspecified toxic substance to cross into the bloodstream. Medically the concerns raised by Wakefield have been disproved and the Lancet has retracted the article, [5] as had the twelve coauthors. Wakefield himself has been found to have had conflicts of interest and has been accused of falsifying his findings [6] and found guilty of professional misconduct by the UK General Medical Council and struck off the medical register. [7] This however is unlikely to completely reassure about multiple vaccines.

As the British media picked up the story, anecdotes from parents began to circulate in support. Vaccination rates in Britain have dropped to the point that outbreaks of the disease are again occurring. Many parents of autistic children on both sides of the Atlantic have embraced the theory. And many parents are just not sure what to think. Is the MMR vaccine really guilty as charged? [8]

This debate definitely is not one to be closed on basis of the majority of medical personnel assuring the vaccinations are safe. In August 2010, a man who suffered severe brain damage after being given the MMR vaccine as a baby has been awarded £90,000 in a compensation ruling. [9]

So do the potential benefits of multiple vaccines outweigh harms of the few? Or are multiple vaccines just too dangerous to use in general?
