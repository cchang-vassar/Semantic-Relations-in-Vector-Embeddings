This debate centres around ending the international ban on the cultivation of the coca plant for human consumption, as established by the United Nations in the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which prohibited the use of the coca leaf except for medical or scientific purposes. The coca leaf is listed on Schedule I of the 1961 Single Convention together with cocaine and heroin. The Convention determined that “The Parties shall so far as possible enforce the uprooting of all coca bushes which grow wild. They shall destroy the coca bushes if illegally cultivated”, and that, “Coca leaf chewing must be abolished within twenty-five years from the coming into force of this Convention”. [1] Support for the legalization of coca cultivation centres around the Andean countries of Bolivia and Peru, where coca leaf production and chewing is legal (within limits), but where cocaine production and use is illegal. This kind of policy is sometimes known as a "coca yes, cocaine no." Much of the support for legal coca cultivation surrounds its historic use among indigenous Andeans and thus its cultural significance. Bolivia exists at the center of the international fight to legalize coca. President Evo Morales has lead this charge, in particular advocating that the UN Narcotics Commission change the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs that forbids the production and use of coca. President Morales generated headlines by chewing coca while attending a meeting of the commission in 2009 and 2011.
