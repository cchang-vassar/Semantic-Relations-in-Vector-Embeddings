Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder defined as severe, self- inflicted starvation leading to body weight at least 15% below that expected for the individualâ€™s sex and height and age. According to the 10 th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization (WHO) AN is a mental illness. It should not be confused with Bulimia nervosa (cycles of bingeing and vomiting or other compensatory behaviour) although these mental disorders have a lot in common and may occur in the same person both sequentially or concurrently. Body image disturbance is a symptom of AN. AN is much more common in teenage girls and young women compared to male individuals and in other age groups, affecting up to 1% of female adolescents in industrialized countries (with money to spend on epidemiological field studies to acquire such knowledge about a- regarding the whole population - rather rare disorder). However, it is a serious disorder with a high mortality between 5% and 18%, and especially considering the young age of those afflicted. Unrealistically slim media portrayals of the female body may increase the risk of developing AN. . Patients who are dangerously thin are sometimes force-fed using a naso-gastric (through the nose) or transdermal duodenal tube (PEG). Normally, medical treatment cannot be administered without the consent of the patient. However, mentally ill patients may not have the mental capacity to make a choice. Despite this, medical ethics, pragmatics and human rights call the treatment into question.
