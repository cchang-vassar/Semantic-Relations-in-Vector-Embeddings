During the debate surrounding the proposed US health care reform legislation of 2009 and 2010, often called Obamacare, one question at hand was whether requiring people to buy private health insurance was Constitutional. Since the passage of the legislation in March of 2010, many state governments, governors, and attorney generals have pressed forward with lawsuits centred on the idea that the individual mandate in the legislation is unconstitutional. Opponents' main argument is that requiring all individuals to buy private insurance violates individual freedoms to abstain from the purchase of any given private product, and that Congress does not have the authority to regulate and punish the decision to abstain. Supporters, however, contend that, in order to make health care accessible to citizens traditionally considered uninsurable, and to lower the costs of health care, all individuals must be included in the risk pool (as otherwise individuals will choose not to buy health insurance, but then still be treated for free in emergency rooms if they get injured or ill). They argue, therefore, that Congress has a compelling interest under the Commerce Clause, which gives congress the power “to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes” 1 , to mandate that all individuals buy insurance.
