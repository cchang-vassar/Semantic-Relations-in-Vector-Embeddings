Epidemiological studies have identified links between smoking and a wide range of medical conditions, from heart disease to male impotence. There is a vast array of information available on the harm that smoking causes and it is easily available. Indeed, in many countries, health warnings are printed on all tobacco products. High profile and costly court settlements from tobacco companies -- in the US particularly -- have highlighted the (almost) universal acceptance that smoking causes many grave and fatal medical conditions It is therefore reasonable to assume that smokers are aware of the effects that smoking has on their health. There is a debate about whether smokers should be entitled to the same level of access to public healthcare as non-smokers, given that they are knowingly harming themselves. This debate is one that has taken place in Parliaments and Universities, as well as cafes and living rooms. For example, in 2006, a UK primary care trust announced that it would remove smokers from its surgery waiting lists to cut costs 1, provoking controversy and bipartisanship throughout the country. Advocates for limiting healthcare access for smokers argue that surgery is less likely to help smokers and that they are unfairly clogging up hospitals by inflicting diseases upon themselves. Many defend smokers however. They argue that healthcare is a fundamental human right and smokers cannot be victimized for doing something perfectly legal. Moreover, they question who would be defined as a "smoker" and how anyone could prove that somebody fitted such a definition. 1 Daily Mail, Give up or we won't operate, smokers told.
