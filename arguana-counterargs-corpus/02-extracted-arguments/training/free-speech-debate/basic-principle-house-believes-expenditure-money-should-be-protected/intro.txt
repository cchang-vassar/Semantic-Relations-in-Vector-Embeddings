The Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission [1] held that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects freedom of speech, prohibited the government from putting restrictions on independent political expenditures by groups such as corporations or trade unions. It did maintain limits on political donations that such groups can give directly to candidates. Therefore, while trade unions and corporations, among others, are not permitted to donate unlimited sums of money to political campaigns, there is no cap on how much they can spend trying to influence an election through issue or attack ads, or by giving money to so called PACs (political action committees), groups which support a candidate but are legally prohibited from coordinating with that candidate. The Citizens United decision built on two previous Supreme Court cases: Santa Clara County v Southern Pacific Railroad (1886), [2] where the Justices first stated that constitutional protections also applied to corporations; and Buckley v Valeo (1976) [3] which established that the expenditure of money could constitute political speech and was, therefore, protected by the First Amendment. The Citizens United decision was arrived at through a two-pronged argument based on previous jurisprudence by the Court: that spending money in an election is a form of political speech and therefore comes within the purview of the First Amendment; and that corporations are also entitled to constitutional protections and therefore their expenditures during an election are also covered by the First Amendment. This debate focuses on the first premise of that argument: is the expenditure of money in an election a form of speech for the purpose of the First Amendment?
