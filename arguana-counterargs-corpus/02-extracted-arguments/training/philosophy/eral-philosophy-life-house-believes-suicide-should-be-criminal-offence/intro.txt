Suicide is the act of intentionally causing ones death. There are almost a million suicides every year [1] with ten to twenty times more suicide attempts. [2] Suicide has traditionally been illegal in many western countries as it is seen by the church as a mortal sin. There is obviously little way of punishing people who have succeeded in the attempt however there have been punishments either in the form of treatment for the body, such as not getting a Christian burial, or for the family who in the middle ages were stripped of their possessions. In 1956 there were 613 prosecutions for attempted suicide in the UK. But with the rise of secularism and doubts about the success of a criminal deterrent, the prohibition of suicide has been lifted in many, for example, England and Wales decriminalised suicide in 1961. [3] But with rising suicide rates many have asked the question: should suicide again be made a criminal offence?
