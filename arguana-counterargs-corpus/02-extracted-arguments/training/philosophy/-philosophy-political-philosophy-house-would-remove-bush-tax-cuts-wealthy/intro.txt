In 2001 and 2003 President Bush implemented a series of tax cuts for all classes of society. These tax cuts were set to expire at the end of 2010. During 2010 there were debates between Republicans and Democrats as to whether the tax cuts should be kept or not. The Democrats proposed two separate deals, the first expiring the Bush tax cuts for all those with an income level above £250,000 and the second for all those with an income level above £1 million. Both bills were passed in the house of representatives but failed to pass in the Senate, not reaching the 60 votes required. At the end of 2010, President Obama came to a deal that temporarily extended the Bush Tax cuts for another two years. Given the level of U.S. debt of $8.6 trillion in 2009 with a deficit of $1.9 trillion, the decision was controversial and remains so. This issue has been exacerbated by recent Democrat plans to implement a 5% surtax for Americans earning more than £1 million. As such the arguments in this debate can realistically also apply to the surtax policy as well as for the removal of tax cuts.
