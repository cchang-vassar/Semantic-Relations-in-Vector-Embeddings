Many different religions have their own systems of rules and practices. These often cover marriage and divorce, bans on certain actions such as drinking alcohol, and rules about worship, rituals and physical dress/appearance. Members of that religion have to follow these rules and the rules of the state where they are in the majority are modelled to incorporate and allow this, indeed religious laws are often part of the foundation of the stateâ€™s law. However with migration around the world there are increasingly minority groups in nations with different systems that are therefore not taken into account. As a result in some cases, religious beliefs are in contradiction to state law, such as Sikhs carrying knives in public, Rastafarians smoking marijuana or certain religious dress codes with regards to school uniform. Recent examples of this debate of this include whether to allow Sharia law courts (Islamic courts) in Canada and the United Kingdom, whether non-Muslims should be allowed to drink alcohol in Muslim countries (such as Iran), and whether Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities should be allowed to slaughter animals in a way that would break animal welfare laws. The status quo is that, in most cases, the law takes precedence over religious beliefs and that religious people are not allowed to practice anything illegal even if it is part of their religion. In this debate, the proposition believes that religious beliefs should be allowed to be practised even when they break the law.
