Anarchism is an ideology that believes that the state is an undesirable and unnecessary. Whilst a 'descent into anarchy' can be used in modern language to describe a decline towards a state of chaos, anarchists believe that a stateless society would be a much better place to live; they point to anarchist communes like Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen as places of peace and contentment free from the state. There are two ways to define this debate and I have tried to include both of them on this page, firstly one can talk about how anarchy is a worthwhile goal in and of its self and how a stateless world would be superior to the one we live in. Secondly it is possible to argue that Anarchism provides an essential voice in a world where people are much too keen to listen to and do exactly what the state tells them.
