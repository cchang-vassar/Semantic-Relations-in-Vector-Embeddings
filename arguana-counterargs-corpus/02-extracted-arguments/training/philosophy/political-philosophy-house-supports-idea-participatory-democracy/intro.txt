The ideal of participatory democracy is to give ordinary citizens the possibility of participating in the public decision-making. The very idea of democracy has changed significantly from the ancient Greek direct democracies to the dominant form of liberal representative democracy existing today in most of the modern nation-states. [1] While in the ancient Greek laws and important decisions were debated and voted on by an assembly comprising of every single citizen, the modern liberal democracies are based on the political representation and elites' competition. Ancient democracies were little city-states like Athens that allowed only a few thousand of their people to be “citizens”, making it possible for the entire voting population to be gathered in one place while leaving the labour in the hands of the slaves and women and even for representatives to be elected on the basis of a lottery. [2] For modern nation-states with universal suffrage this is impractical. Modern democracies with mass electorates are all representative democracies in which elected politicians make decisions on behalf of the people, rather than the people making decisions directly. Although purely direct democracy may be impractical, there are several ways in which representative democracies can become much more participative. In other words, there are several ways in which a more participatory approach of democracy can allow citizens to become direct contributors to the public decisions and improve the political representation in our liberal institutions. Several political participatory formulas already exist today. Some of them are already consolidated in current democracies, for example primary elections in political parties, [3] limitation of mandates and rotation of public positions. [4] Other examples are less common but growing, for figure constitutional or legislative refrenda, [5] popular legislative initiative, or participatory budgeting. California, for example, allows its citizen-initiated referenda: anyone can propose a new law, and if they can get enough signatures on a petition in support of it, the law is put directly to the people in a public vote. [6] Another example is the right of recall: allowing citizens to force early elections if enough of them sign a petition saying they are unhappy with the current government (used in California and British Columbia). [7] There are significant examples regarding participatory budgeting, such as Porto Alegre (Brasil), where citizens are involved directly in the configuration of the public investments throughout territorial and sectorial meetings with experts, politicians, civil society organisations and individual citizens. [8] Much greater participation is also increasingly possible as a result of online voting and discussion that avoids the problem of bringing millions of people to one place to make decisions. [9]

Then, if we imagine a continuum between a complete direct democracy, where all the citizens participate in all public decisions, and a pure representative one, where the government of public affairs lies solely in the hands of political or representative elites, we can see that some kind of intermediate formulas might be discussed and applied in the existing democratic political communities. We should understand democracy as a gradual process instead of a binary concept. [10] This means thinking of government as a phenomena that can be more or less democratic rather than only democratic or nondemocratic. As a result we will see that participatory forms of government can improve both, the efficiency and the sustainability of our political institutions in the era of technological and educational revolution we live today.
