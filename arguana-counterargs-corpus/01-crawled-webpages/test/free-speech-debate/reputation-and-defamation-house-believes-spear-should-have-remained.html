	<h3>The case: Zuma and his spear</h3>

<p>In May 2012, South Africa&rsquo;s president, Jacob Zuma, turned to the courts to ban a painting, which showed him fully clothed but with his genitals exposed.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18182318">The case was brought against</a>&nbsp;Johannesburg&rsquo;s Goodman Gallery for displaying artist Brett Murray&rsquo;s The Spear, a satirical painting done in the style of Soviet-era posters of Vladimir Lenin and City Press newspaper for republishing it. The case was first lodged on behalf of Zuma in his capacity as president of South Africa. However, on the first day of the court case, Zuma&rsquo;s lawyer, Gcina Malindi,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Right-to-dignity-only-applies-to-people-Judge-20120524">agreed</a>&nbsp;that &ldquo;the office of the president&rdquo; has no dignity as such and therefore agreed to drop the claim. It was then lodged on behalf of Zuma in his personal capacity.</p>

<p>Malindi initially called for the painting to be removed from the gallery, for all promotional materials to be destroyed and for City Press to delete images of The Spear from its website. The ruling African National Congress and the trade union movement COSATU called on South Africans to boycott City Press. One of South Africa&rsquo;s largest churches, the Nazareth Baptist Church, jumped to the president&rsquo;s defence, calling for Murray to be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.citypress.co.za/SouthAfrica/News/Cleric-ordered-to-retract-stoning-statement-20120524">stoned to death</a>.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing the gallery&nbsp;<a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/05/24/jacob-zuma-and-anc-in-court-to-ban-penis-painting">argued</a>&nbsp;that artistic expression is protected under the South African constitution. Zuma&rsquo;s lawyers contended that the painting violates the president&rsquo;s right to dignity, which is also safeguarded by the constitution. In a legal affidavit, the president&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/9281847/Jacob-Zuma-The-Spear-painting-defaced-ahead-of-court-action.html">said</a>: &ldquo;The portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests I am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect &hellip; In terms of the theme of the exhibition, my portrait is meant to convey a message that I am an abuser of power, corrupt and suffer political ineptness.&rdquo; Murray said the work was a satire of &ldquo;political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broadcast context of SA discourse&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The same month, two men, one black and one white,&nbsp;<a href="http://mg.co.za/article/2012-05-23-zuma-painting-defaced-to-prevent-civil-war">defaced the painting</a>, resulting in the gallery&rsquo;s removal of it. Furthermore, the editor of City Press, Ferial Haffajee,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.citypress.co.za/SouthAfrica/News/The-Spear-is-down-out-of-care-and-fear-20120528">withdrew</a>&nbsp;an image of the painting from its website as an &ldquo;olive branch&rdquo; to angered black individuals as well as in response to &ldquo;fear&rdquo; bred by &ldquo;threats and invective&rdquo; against the newspaper and its staff. On 30 May 2012, the ANC agreed to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/south-africa/120530/zuma-the-spear-painting-removed-anc-deal-goodman-ga">drop the lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://freespeechdebate.com/en/case/zuma-and-his-spear/">Author&#39;s opinions</a></strong></p>

<p><em>Nimi Hoffman</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/96cons2.htm#10">Article 12</a>&nbsp;of the South African Constitution protects the right to inherent dignity, but insulting judgments of character are constitutional, since they do not undermine inherent dignity by questioning the value of a person as a human being.</p>

<p>However, what has been labelled &ldquo;Penisgate&rdquo; does not relate to the right to the freedom of speech in an obvious or uncomplicated way. South Africa has a clear apartheid history of&nbsp;<a href="http://sacsis.org.za/s/story.php?s=1302">infantilising and sexualising black men</a>, and black individuals continue to suffer disproportionate violations of basic human rights, such as the rights to decent work, housing and education.&nbsp; This may explain why people are particularly upset about the work. Critics have argued that the ANC exploited this to deflect attention away from pressing socio-economic concerns and bolster popular support during internal ANC election campaigns. Other critics have argued that insistence on Zuma&rsquo;s right to dignity appears petty when compared with the way in which ordinary South Africans&rsquo; right to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/spear-today-gone-tomorrow.htm">material dignity</a>&nbsp;are routinely and broadly violated.</p>

<p>Ferial Haffajee&rsquo;s withdrawal of The Spear&nbsp;has been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page72308?oid=301857&amp;sn=Marketingweb+detail&amp;pid=90389">roundly criticised</a>&nbsp;by some black intellectuals for giving into political bullying, for being condescending to black South Africans by assuming a homogeneity of views, and refusing the constitutional free speech rights of dissenters.</p>

<p>A more subtle criticism concerns racial inequalities in the artworld. Bretty Murray, the painter of The Spear, is white. In 2010, black artist Ayanda Mabuli produced a far more graphic and critical artwork entitled&nbsp;<em>Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi</em>&nbsp;(Better a fool than a rich man&rsquo;s nonsense). Amongst other things, it depicted Jacob Zuma with his penis in crutches. Why then, <a href="http://imfundo.wordpress.com/2012/05/23/ayanda-mabulu-vs-brett-murray/">Unathi Kondile asks</a>, was there no outcry over Mabulu&rsquo;s depiction of President Zuma? Kondile argues that black artists are routinely sidelined and required to make &ldquo;identity&rdquo; art in order to gain any sort of recognition. Since Mabuli&rsquo;s work did not do so, it was ignored. Kondile&rsquo;s thesis is thought-provoking; the assumption, he argues, is that &ldquo;a black artist is intellectually incapable of producing a complex work &ndash; blacks are incapable of satire &ndash; until they are verified by their white counterparts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite its limitations, the case of &ldquo;Penisgate&rdquo; shows the high levels of public discussion and criticism in South Africa, which are crucial to a deliberative democracy. The question remains as to whether this case can be used to open the door to more constructive debates around gender equality, racial equality, and the politics of art.</p>

<p><em>Maryam Omidi</em></p>

<p>City Press should not have yielded to the ANC&rsquo;s political bullying. While I understand that the paper compromised a principle &ndash; in this case the right to free speech &ndash; for social harmony, I think it sets a harmful precedent. It sends out the following message: intimidation can be used to chill freedom of expression. The artwork may have been in bad taste, but this does not mean it should have been removed or banned. Provocative art challenges our commitment to free speech and we should tread carefully to ensure the right example is set. If we dislike a creative work, we usually have the option of not hearing, viewing or reading it &ndash; as we did in this case.</p>

<p>Furthermore, through his art Murray was making a political statement. He was highlighting the corruption in Zuma&rsquo;s government &ndash; the artwork was part of an exhibition called Hail to the Thief &ndash; and making a judgement on the president&rsquo;s controversial sexual relations, above all, the allegations of rape. As president of the country, Zuma should be open to a higher level of criticism and satire than the ordinary citizen.</p>

The subject matter in many instances is their own choice; therefore they have the right to say what they want about the subject matter, safe in the knowledge that is their opinion alone being portrayed.</p>
<p>The artist that painted ‘The Spear’, Brett Murray, created the piece as part of an exhibition that reflected his own discontent at the lack of major progress since the ruling African National Congress took power in South Africa after the end of Apartheid in 1994. Murray used his work to promulgate an idea that he has, allowing for others to see the art work for themselves and make up their own minds about President Zuma and the ANC.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Art Galleries have a right to display any artist they feel will attract visitors as well showcase the forms of art that they believe is suitable. The Goodman Gallery saw no issue with Murray’s work to the extent that they prevented any particular works from being displayed. As it was their venue which was the setting for ‘The Spear’s display, The Goodman Gallery had the right to take decisions independently of external pressure. The removal of the exhibit sets a dangerous precedent whereby government can unduly censor artworks, threatening the free actions of artists and the galleries that display their work in turn affecting plural, democratic discourse.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>While public art is valuable, it can serve a purpose to educate and send a message, influencing discourse. Criticism of a political figure, when expressed via an art form, can change perceptions of that figure, particularly when their policy is under scrutiny. However, the image portrayed in ‘The Spear’ does not do these things. It does not focus on the policies of President Zuma, but rather relies on innuendo surrounding the President’s personal life, graphically represented by Zuma’s exposed penis, which is a prominent feature of the painting.</p>
<p>While artists have a right to criticise those in authority and galleries have a right to display any art it wants, such rights are balanced by responsibilities over how such artists conduct themselves when they choose to enter political discourse. A provocative image such as ‘The Spear’ flouts those responsibilities by relying upon graphic innuendo instead of policy criticism to get the point across. This is damaging for a number of reasons specific to the South African context which will be explained in the Opposition Arguments.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>The removal of ‘The Spear’ from the Goodman Gallery and the City Press also hints at a threat to pluralism, especially when one considers the political nature of the campaign to have such images removed.</p>
<p>While Jacob Zuma attempted to have the image banned in a personal capacity, the intensive campaigning by both the ANC and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) against both the Goodman Gallery and City Press<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> hints at a dangerously political action taken by those with close access to power over the South African state.   </p>
<p>This should be cause to worry. Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa, in place since 1997, protects freedoms such as Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Association.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> The intimidation of Art Galleries and Newspapers threatens the free exchange of ideas that occurs in these areas, as well sending an implicit image by its supports that criticism of the Government cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>If neither the Gallery nor City Press removed the image of ‘The Spear’ from public view, then a clear message would have been sent that the principles of Free Speech, Free Association and Freedom of Intimidation outlined in the Constitution is to be upheld at all times, regardless of who may take offence at what is being said. It is important in the South African context to protect the right to criticise the government and voice opinions that vary from the ideals of the majority. It is worrying what kind of message is sent by those close to the South African Government that intimidation seems to be the appropriate response to criticism such as this rather than asking why such criticism is there in the first place.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Just because groups and individuals have a Freedom of Expression, does not mean it can be used without proper consideration of whom maybe hurt and offended by connotations implied in the image. A White artist portraying the Black leader of the country and the ANC as someone who leads with their genitals goes someway to dehumanising him, launching into character assassination that fails to actually examine policy.</p>
<p>Pluralism can exist without needlessly causing offence in the way Murray has done in this painting. The Constitution protects Freedom of Expression; however the grave offence causedto many people by dehumanising President Zuma in this way can justify the protests against the artworks installation and replication in the news media. No constructive criticism is meted out in the painting, thus justifying counter-protests against it.</p>
<p>While there were supporters of the ANC and COSATU, who are allied with the government, who took part in protests, it is a stretch to suggest that this is political overreach in action. The image attacked the President in ways that evoked previous allegations against him that were later disproven in court. The President took legal action in a personal capacity, whilst other exhibits created by Murray which highly critical of the ANC were not targeted in this manner, hinting at there being a free platform for criticism and satire in South African Political discourse.</p>

This line of opposition is part of a dog-whistle tactic that the ANC has consistently used against white critics of its government in the past.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>ANC criticisms of its white critics, including the opposition Democratic Alliance have made discreet reference to the injustices of the past as a means of creating distrust in the minds of poor, black voters who maintain ANC support as a result. Some politicians within the ANC, most notably the former President of its youth wing Julius Malema, have made incendiary statements that could be seen to stoke up hatred against whites.</p>
<p>It is against this back drop that the double standards over criticism of Murray should be viewed. Murray, a white artist, has been criticised roundly for ‘The Spear’, while black artists have created works that could be seen to denigrate President Zuma in a similar manner to ‘The Spear’. A noticeable example is ‘Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi’ (Better a fool than a rich man’s nonsense) by Ayanda Mabulu, that carried a much more graphic depiction of the President and other leading politicians of the past and present with barely a murmur raised.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>By bowing to the pressure exerted by the ANC and its followers, the Goodman Gallery and City Press have bowed to pressure, denying criticism of the government and accepting the implied view that White South Africans are unable to criticise the government without seeking to re-assert any forms of superiority that had existed under Apartheid. Whilst there may still be underlying problems of Far-Right activity in South Africa, to smear anyone who criticises the government based on their race does nothing to help move the country on from autocracy and institutionalised racism. The Goodman Gallery and City Press should have stood by displaying the image as it represented the opinion of Brett Murray, free from intimidation or race based slander.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>To somehow state that racism is the motivation to criticisms of ‘The Spear’ is fanciful and far-fetched. People were massively offended by the piece and as such used their right to protest to demonstrate the fact. The artwork itself was vulgar, displaying images that would be offensive to anyone, regardless of race.</p>
<p>No-one is accusing Murray of being in favour of restoring Apartheid; indeed his early works in the 1980’s attacked the government of the day, highlighting their crimes. But when a public gallery and a newspaper releases an image that is seen as offensive to many people on many levels, provoking angry responses in the process, then it is only right that such images are removed to prevent further protest and controversy for those involved.</p>
<p>It is also erroneous to accuse the ANC of race-baiting. It is a multi-racial organisation and has had prominent non-Black members leading the organisation during the struggle. If any criticism of White Opponents including the Democratic Alliance is seen to be racialised, then it is probably a reflection upon the DA’s ineffectiveness in gaining the support of poor black voters, remaining a party for privileged whites as a result. Criticism of Murray was not based on race, rather the shocking and offensive artwork that hurt so many people, not least the President himself.    </p>

<p>Whatever one believes about ‘The Spear’ it is clear that Murray attacked President Zuma based upon his personal life rather than any critique of policy. The depiction of the President with his penis exposed is a reminder of the accusations of rape against him, of which he was acquitted in 2007.</p>
<p>To remind those who view the painting of the accusation is to hint at Zuma’s guilt in the case despite it being proved otherwise in a court of law. This is effectively libel and as such defames Zuma’s character. As such, Zuma was right to sue for defamation and it was right for the artwork to be removed as it implied and spread a falsehood in the public domain that is damaging to Zuma.</p>

Zuma has done controversial things before and during his time in office that are worthy of criticism and ‘The Spear’ amongst the rest of the exhibition reflects this. No one should be above criticism, especially if their actions will have an impact upon many people. </p>

Criticism of the piece is welcome as part of debate based on facts, not emotion like what was seen during the controversy. Maintaining ‘The Spear’s display is part of this, triggering a debate over ANC policies in the here and now, as opposed to referring to past injustices. Removing ‘The Spear’ prevents that rational debate and instead sends a message that merely shouting down opponents is a suitable solution to an argument, harming South African political discourse in the long term.</p>

Such messages can be critical of government, but it must be best if they do not cause widespread offence in the process.</p>
<p>The problem with ‘The Spear’ is that is causes widespread offence with the graphic depiction of the male genitalia. As a result, the underlying message that Brett Murray is trying to convey is lost in the offence image of the exposed penis, causing needless controversy in the process. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The utilisation of an exposed penis in ‘The Spear’ breaches all notions of public decency, not only causing offence in the public domain, but also personal offence, by depicting President Zuma in such a lewd manner. As such, it is right to ask for the removal of the artwork from public display to prevent further offence from being caused.</p>

Such a debate over Zuma’s fitness for office would not have been possible without an image that brought home the seriousness of the personal accusations against him and whether such allegations make him incompatible with the office of President. Murray was free to depict an image that at best a plurality of people would disagree with, and given the subject matter, that image was appropriate to use.  </p>
