	<p>Campaign Finance has always been a point of contention in American politics and the subject of a great deal of media attention every election cycle, because American political campaigns are particularly long and incredibly expensive. &nbsp;Money is needed to pay staff, buy media advertisement, and even raise more money. Presidential campaigns often cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Senate and congressional campaigns can cost several million dollars. In parliamentary democracies with smaller districts and shorter election cycles (or more irregular election cycles), the costs could be different and less significant.</p>

<p><br />
Campaign finance reform (CFR) began in earnest in the post-Watergate era in the United States with the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act which created the Federal Election Commission (FEC), implemented disclosure requirements, donation limits, and federal financing of Presidential elections. The landmark Supreme Court decision of <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em> (1976) struck down the controversial provision of spending limits, as well as a provision of the law that limited the amount of personal money someone could spend on their own campaign. Eventually, this system of laws unraveled as the Supreme Court affirmed that political parties, labor unions, and political action committees(PACs) could spend unlimited amounts of âsoft moneyâ - spending not directly associated with a candidateâs campaign, such as broad issue advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts, and party building strategies.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> PACs are types of organisations that campaign for or against candidates and are allowed to receive limited contributions from individuals but not from corporations and unions.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></p>

<p>However, in 2010 a landmark case came before the Supreme Court, <em>Citizens United v FEC,</em> which overturned a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act that prohibited corporations and labor unions from airing issue advocacy advertisements during the weeks immediately preceding an election. &nbsp;Furthermore, it overturned a prior Supreme Court decision that prohibited corporations and unions from engaging in direct advocacy â that is, advertisements that directly encourage citizens to vote for or against a candidate. Along with other related court decision, this decision is connected to the formation of Super PACs. &nbsp;Super PACs, in turn, are organizations that can receive unlimited individual, corporate, and labor union contributions to influence elections but may not co-ordinate with their chosen candidateâs campaign.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> &nbsp;Total Super PACs spending on 2012 Elections reached $567,498,628 which invokes doubts over the integrity, corruption, and accountability of candidates to their constituency in comparison to their contributors. Super PACS are required by law to disclose the names of their donors and the amounts that people have donated. There have been other recent setbacks in bringing transparency to US politics, the DISCLOSE Act for example was blocked by the Republicans, but there has been legislation requiring on air identification of all advertisers.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a></p>

<p>Bearing these events in mind, this debate will be looking at a campaign finance reform on whether corporations and individuals should be permitted to make unlimited contributions; whether corporations deserve the same political and/or speech rights as individuals; and whether those who engage in issuing advertisements should disclose their donors in the advertisements. &nbsp;</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Currently, Super PACs are organizations that can receive unlimited contributions, which encourages the belief that the amount of money contributed is directly correlated to the amount of influence the donor could have. By permitting individuals or corporations to make unlimited contributions, the current legislation undermines the democratic character of the elective process. Political figures related to the sponsored Super PACs have an incentive to satisfy the needs of those who contribute huge amounts of funding towards their campaign rather than meet the needs of the average citizen. This is not the way that democracy should be; it must represent the viewpoint and needs of the majority of the population, not just the small fraction of it that is wealthy enough to effectively pay for policies they want. Furthermore, caps on contributions to Super PACs will bring competition in elections back into the mainstream and when more citizens contribute to politicians, they will be more engaged in politics.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Â For example, the pass of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) eliminated soft money for parties and attempted to handle the elections contributions through PACs. With the elimination of soft money for parties, the role of interest groups investment decreased in the 1990s.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>Â Obamaâs campaign in 2008 raised 114.1 million or 34% of his general election fund from small contributions. His unprecedented small donor fundraising success can be interpreted as increased credibility and public visibility for Obama and through this the benefit of mobilizing lots of small donations. In 2008, Obama used online communications and social networking tools to reach and mobilise more people. In effect of this approach, he not only inspired an unprecedented number of young and retired people to get involved in the campaign, but also achieved the highest rate of small contributions.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>To limit the ability of any person or a group, to influence a democratic political process is rather undemocratic and discriminatory. Groups should to be able to express their voice, and attempt to influence politics. Any form of limitation of that is an infringement of their rights as citizens in a democratic country.</p>
<p>Limiting contributions could equally be used to achieve a partisan advantage. The Tillman Act banning corporate contributions to campaigns in 1907 is a good example. It was sponsored by the South Carolina senator Tillman who wanted to embarrass President Roosevelt for his heavily reliance on corporate funding in his 1904 election campaign. Tillman often bragged about his role in vote frauds; thus, revealing his bill was less about public good and more to gain partisan advantage.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Â This was repeated a couple of times since, despite the numerous regulatory bills that have been passed. According to Smithâs research, the effect of campaign-finance regulations has been to help people who passed them and to strengthen special interest, rather than to cleanse American politics of the influence of self-interested factions. Money is the means by which those who lack talents or other resources with direct political value are able to participate in politics beyond voting. This reform favour people and corporations skilled and able to afford political advertising over those skilled in other building homes or other fields with no media influence.</p>
<p>Thus, the reform undermines efforts for equal access to the political arena by restricting campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Data analysis of the last three elections also shows that campaign âfinance regulations are of little value. Many scholars, such as Stephen Ansolabehere, James Snyder, and John de Figueiredo, believe that it is not the contributions that corrupt politicians, therefore, limiting contributions will not tackle the problem of corruption. Legislatorsâ votes usually depend on own beliefs and preferences of their voters and their parties and contributions have no detectable effects on legislative behaviour.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>Â The past two elections at which Obama won over better known and funded leaders like Hillary Clinton and Romney who did not lack funds shows that support for ideology was more important than funds.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>When a corporation and an individual are both trying to achieve the same goal, they should be able to do so in the same way. It would be unfair if the campaign finance reform limits the amount that an individual could contribute, but not that of a corporation when it is apparent that corporations are contributing considerably larger amounts than individuals as seen in the case of the pharmaceutical industry. Corporations need to have the same rights and limitations on campaign contributions and economic freedom.</p>
<p>This was why the US Supreme Court ruled that the federal ban on spending by corporations was unconstitutional under the First Amendment Act in 2010. This led to the Super PACs because they represent an association of people and have the right to freedom of speech and political preference. Reforms, such as Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) may have been successful in curtailing interest groups role as investors in campaigns, they failed when it comes to candidate advocacy as a result of super PACs. Such regulations that limit large-scale political spending from interest groups serves to limit speech crucial to political groups without a broad base of support or political entrepreneurs like Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that got its message aired when the national media was ignoring the issue. Moreover, bans on corporate contributions did not prevent alternative ways for candidate advocacy, such as the private satellite radio station of the National Rifle Association or the movies made by the Citizens United<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Â These alternative ways could undermine the principle of fair and transparent campaigns more than the lack of such limit on spending from individuals and corporations and their political expression.</p>

Corporations and individuals are two completely different entities and they represent different interests. While an individual accounts for her interests, a company represents a large number of people. In addition, difference in the size of individual and corporate campaign contributions is usually quite significant.</p>
<p>Â Â Â  Despite increasing number of individual contributions, the donations from large interest groups, such as corporations, often exceeds sums from individuals as in 2000 and 2001- by $176 million and &amp;171 million respectively. Empirical evidence suggests that large sums from corporations almost never buys votes but access to policy-makers at key moments of policymaking after campaigns which has serious implications on the levels of corruption.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Â While individuals often contribute as an act of democratic participation, the interest groups donate money in campaigns as investment. Therefore, the rules regulating them should be different.Reforms like the BCRA that limit donations from corporations and unions enable individual contributions and minimizes the role and influence of interest groups.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>A further reform limiting super PACs would have the effect of leveling the playing field for candidates. Candidates with enormous leadership potential but small wallets have failed due to the lack of resources. Under a reformed campaign finance system, it will be more difficult for well-financed candidates to win purely because of the money they have. Incumbent candidates have a unique advantage over challengers in the present system because of their direct connections to important sources of money.</p>
<p>Campaign finance reform will make elections more competitive and thus enhance higher turnover or "fresh blood" in politics. This is essential for challenging old orthodoxies and bringing in new ideas. It will also make it easier for members of ethnic minorities and the working class to seek office - such groups are disproportionately deterred from candidacy by the current need to raise large sums of money.</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis of elections involving incumbents from twenty-five states across three election cycles indicate that more stringent campaign finance laws increase the likelihood ofÂ  new challengers to the current incumbent.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Â  Financing laws limiting fundraising increase the likelihood of minority-party and independent challengers and produce higher rate of election competition. As a result challengers feel they have better chances against the incumbents.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Even under the most radical proposals for reform, loopholes will exist and enable candidates to spend more or reach their audiences through alternative means. This was precisely the kind of development which led reformers to want to close the soft-money loophole. As with the tax system, the more elaborate the regulation, the more obscure and distorting the ways that are adopted to get around it.</p>
<p>There is actually a higher turnover in public office than some critics of the present campaign finance systems would like to admit. Retirements, scandals, and careful allocation of party resources make turnover possible under a variety of scenarios. Turnover also has significant negative effects, as critics of term limits have pointed-out. The more often new officeholders begin their jobs the steeper the "learning curve" for a new Congress or other legislative body becomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the effect for challengers could be different. Finance limitations benefit the most popular candidates who already have a large base of support. Political minorities, newcomers, and outcasts will find it difficult to reach enough people to raise the money they need through many small contributions. The financial limitations further limit the possibilities for such campaigns in the future.</p>

At present, the enormous amount of money channeled into campaigns by large corporations, unions, and special interest groups through PACs overwhelm the smaller, limited contributions of individual donors. Reforming the super PACs and limiting these large group donations would increase the significance of donations by individual voters, likely increasing the responsiveness of candidates to voters/donors and so increasing their accountability to their electorate.

Short of such bans, the potential for large organizations to swamp the donations of individual voters still exists. Additionally, limitations on the voice of unions, businesses and special interest groups are another form of potential infringement on the rights of free speech and assembly. Who is to say that a union memberâs contribution to their organizationâs political action committee is not significant speech comparable to the individual gesture they make when they donate to a candidate themselves? It is reasonable that union members or shareholders choose to trust their leaders to use their money in order to best advance their interests.</p>

Corporations and individuals are two completely different entities and they represent different interests. While an individual accounts for her interests, a company represents a large number of people and may not fully represent the views of any of them. Thus many big companies while favoring one party or the other actually give to both parties, Honeywell International for example to July 2012 had given more than $2.2million with 63% going to the Republicans and the rest to the Democrats.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Â These companies clearly then bet on both sides, presumably however their senior staff are actually supporting one or the other. Â </p>
<p>Â Â Â  Empirical evidence suggests that large sums from corporation almost never buys votes but access to policy-makers at key moments of policymaking after campaigns which has serious implications on the levels of corruption. While individuals often contribute as an act of democratic participation, the interest groups donate money in campaigns as investment. Therefore, the rules regulating them should be different. Reforms like the BCRA that limit donations from corporations and unions enable individual contributions and minimize the role and influence of interest groups.</p>

<p>Firstly, when dealing with the general public actually knowing who is contributing, the vast majority of these contributions, whether from a corporation or an individual, are contributed under the names of individuals. The first problem with this is that thousands of names of individuals cannot fit into a commercial advertisement. There would have to be a list created which is made public, but, unfortunately, the vast majority of people will not seek this list out and so will not become any more informed about who is behind the advertisement.</p>
<p>The second problem is that even if the public did find the list, individual names do not hold any weight or indication of the types of interests that are backing campaigns and advertisements. âJohn Smithâ and âJoe Jonesâ will not indicate to a normal person that this advertisement was funded by an oil company even if these people are the oil companyâs CEO and Managing Director.</p>
<p>Secondly, corporations and large businesses that want to avoid detection will simply donate the money under an individualâs name or donate âin the nameâ of multiple employees of the company in quantities small enough not to raise any suspicion as they already do with current campaign donations to stay under funding caps. There are already instances, such as ASG in 2012, where CEOs pressurise their employees into making donations,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>Â if they are no longer able to spend as much as they wish themselves they will be much more likely to use their employees.</p>
