	<p>The relationship between the media and democracy is controversial. The media always claim they just “inform the public” whilst critics claim they actually shape public opinion, thereby “controlling” democracy. One possible way in which this happens is through opinion polls. In an opinion poll, an organization, such as a political party, a research company or a media company, questions a representative panel of citizens (usually about 1000) about their opinions on a political subject or about candidates. Very often polls ask people how they would vote if there were an election today, and the media uses the results to project the share of the national vote that different parties would achieve. Such polls are very common in the period of an election campaign, when five or more different surveys may be published in a week, and the results are picked over in detail by political commentators.</p>

<p>Different countries take different attitudes to the role of opinion polls in a democracy. Many impose no limitations on the publication of polls in the media, but some, including France, South Korea, Mexico and Taiwan, ban the publication of opinion polls in the days running up to a national election. In France, for example, the media cannot publish opinion polls of voting intention in the week before each round of national voting.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> The issue of opinion polls is particularly controversial in India where the Election Commission used to ban the publication of opinion polls in the days before and during national elections which are conducted over a period of some twenty days in five regional days of voting. In 1999, the Indian Supreme Court overturned this rule following a challenge brought by a newspaper.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> However, today the main political parties have joined with the Election Commission in an attempt to reintroduce the ban.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> A similar situation exists in Canada where restrictions on the publication of opinion polls were overturned in its Supreme Court in 1998.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a><br />
It might be useful to focus the debate by determining what type of opinion polls are harming the democratic process: opinion polls about general subjects, polls projecting the outcome of elections before election-day, or exit-polls (which ask actual voters how they have cast their ballot) on election-day. There could be a variety of choices for a particular plan and the debate which follows only offers one possible method.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the debate could occur primarily at the value level addressing the general influence of opinion polls on the democratic process.&nbsp;&nbsp; The democratic process could include a variety of ways that citizens participate or are informed prior to the selection of policies and candidates.&nbsp; In particular, harm to the democratic process should be addressed with some specificity if it is argued that harm occurs.&nbsp; With the proliferation of public messages and the increased use of various media to carry those messages, the relationship of public opinion polls to democratic dialogue challenges the exploration of voter choices and the information on which those choices are made.</p>

    <div class="field-items">
          <div class="field-item even"><p>In democratic nations public opinion matters as it is the public who ultimately decides who wins office and opinion polls measure that opinion. As a result politicians have become obsessed with the shifting whims of public opinion upon which the media focuses forcing politicians also focus on popular opinion even between elections.   Since the media carries the news, the active use of opinion polls by the media drives the policy agenda.  Lack of information on critical issues is likely to result as politicians focus only on areas where the opinion polls highlight.</p>
<p>Democracy is also harmed by the publication of opinion polls as subsequent citizen voter behaviour can be influenced.   When , for example, an opinion poll portrays a huge majority for a certain subject, or for a particular party, its opponents might be less vocal since they feel “outnumbered” or that decisions have already been made thus diminishing democratic dialogue.   Undecided voters may be apathetic toward the election process since they appear to be a foregone conclusion.  The potential influence on voters choices is the reason the France forbids opinion polls shortly before an election. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Even though polls may alter public dialogue, an explanation of what stifles debate is not sufficiently provided by the proposition.  They seem to infer that ‘stifling’ by opinion polls suggests a that debate shuts down whereas we claim that a politician’s responses to public opinion is exactly what is sought by the public to make them better informed.   The stifling of debate does not occur.  So even though, the prop suggests that stifling debate is hindering debate, this has not been proven since responses by politicians to opinion polls are simply part of dialogue and not necessarily hindering discussion.</p>
<p>The observation that voter behaviour is some- how unfairly influenced through strength of numbers doesn’t include all of the close results which are often reported between platforms or candidates.  The assumption that voters feeling outnumbered will often occur <em>and</em> will change their vote as a result cannot be made.  Most citizens are already aware of their political leanings regardless of opinion polls or popular opinion.  The undecided voter is not necessarily waiting on opinion polls but more likely the continuing debate occurring through the election cycle.    Apathy among voters occurs for many other reasons besides the publication of opinion polls.  We cannot be certain that the exclusion of public polls to protect apathetic voters will significantly outweigh the value of a more informed public.  That democracy is harmed through opinion polls has not been established.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Since opinion polls are the products of research, they can also be heavily manipulated by the organization performing or commissioning the poll in question.   A bias can easily be created by selecting a certain target group, such as a 2011 AP opinion poll which asked more democrats than republicans,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> or more usually through asking certain questions or phrasing them in a particular way.  For example it has been found that Americans are more likely to support spending for the ‘poor’ than for ‘welfare’.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> This information can generate false information and untrue or exaggerated claims.   Even if the research is done with an objective mindset, the research technique or reporting method can skew the results.   For example, the opinion polls seldom report the measure of uncertainty of the conclusions, by for example reporting standards deviations from means, sample size, etc.   These measures are usually not published.  Reporting the results of opinion polls without further statistical information leads to more misinformation.  One such example comes from the exit polls of the 2004 U.S. Presidential election.  Many of the election polls predicted a win for Kerry, but didn’t consider the fact that Republicans were less likely to respond to an exit poll leading to inaccurate conclusions about what would occur.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Thus, opinion polls are not necessarily trustworthy sources of information on which voters can make good decisions.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>The general claim here is that opinion polls can be subject to error and lead to questionable information and decision-making by voters.   Also, it has been claimed that opinion polls can be manipulated consciously or inadvertently which then should justifies their damnation.  The opposition claims that any tool which gathers information could be manipulated or inadvertently misused.  Audience polling is simply a method to gather group opinion and audience analysis is as old as Aristotle as a method for speakers to better understand audiences.  Audience response is often sought in regard to attitudes and to isolate opinion polls as not useful or necessary because of possible error or corruption. This denies the need for those advocating to understand the position of those these seek to persuade.   To say that opinion polls should not be used because of these reasons would suggest that audience feedback never be used because of possible errors in conclusions.  It is far better to understand the nature of polling and its risk factors than to simply abandon the use of this important link between the voter and the politician.  The nature of audience polling is critical to communication and should not be dismissed because of its potential for misuse.</p>

          <div class="field-item even"><p>Tactical voting is the purposeful casting of votes to sway an outcome.   When the outcome is predicted in an opinion poll, it can influence voters to possibly cast a ballot differently than had that poll information not existed.    This means that the votes are being cast based upon inaccurate assumptions.  For instance, in the 1992 U.K. elections all polls predicted a Labour victory.  However, against all expectations, the Conservatives won.  It is wholly possible that many people, ensured of a seeming Labour victory, then decided to vote for the Conservatives tactically to ensure that there would be a balance in the House of Commons – or even out of sympathy, the ‘underdog effect’.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Or decided to vote for their first preference minor party, such as the liberal democrats, because they believed the Conservatives would be voted out without their needing to cast their votes tactically for Labour. Thus, it is possible that the voters didn’t accomplish the government they actually wanted, as they cast votes based on opinion polls.  The unintended outcomes are a result of these opinion polls and tactical voting.</p>

The very nature of tactical voting includes an element of chance and is a strategic method to influence the outcome.  Any activity involving chance and risk could have unintended outcomes.   Opinion polls have often existed in the past when the outcome was different than expected whether tactical voting was a strategy in play or not.   Tactical voting could occur whether opinion polls existed or not. Therefore, the publication of opinion polls still remains a legitimate tool of the democratic process in which voters have a right to participate.</p>

<p>Restricting opinion polls would be a bad precedent and could become the basis for other restrictions of free speech.   For example, in India some have proposed banning the publication of horoscopes during the election period.</p>
<p>Democracy itself is safeguarded by opinion polls which represent public expression for they also ensure transparency in public will and choices and can thus discourage or reveal electoral fraud and vote-rigging.  Such information could be observed both nationally and internationally.  In fact, those regimes which ban or heavily restrict opinion polling are those which are either undemocratic or where corrupt in the election process exists.   These regimes know that allowing opinion polling would embarrassingly reveal their lack of legitimacy and could lead to a domestic and international outcry against them.

<p>Also, the claim that any attempt to restrict free expression is bad because of the possible consequences which follow is faulty in reasoning.  Stating that one thing “could” lead to another is speculative and not sufficient reason to reject a legitimate need to restrict some expression.</p>
<p>Opinion polls do contain some information which may assist in transparency.   However, since as has previously been noted, polls can be biased and manipulated and so could be equally untrustworthy in providing a check on fraud or corruption in the voting process.  Therefore the claims provided by the opposition do not by themselves lead to a sufficient reason to reject support for restrictions to opinion polls.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are many opinion polls and there is competition between opinion poll firms.  There are differences about how studies are conducted as well as their reliability.  Thus opinion polls themselves possess a certain level of credibility.  The media and citizens discern the least valuable polls and those with less scientific reliability.  Some are likely lose legitimacy, whereas the most trustworthy polls gain more attention.   For example, in the U.S., the polls that Fox News runs are seen differently than polls conducted by Pew Research which is likely to receive more widespread recognition. </p>
<p>A well conducted poll can be very accurate.   It is reckoned that a sample of 1,000 people can accurately reflect the views of more than 200 million adults to within a few percentage points.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>   Polling is a statistical science with an established literature and the publication of ongoing research.  There is no reason that citizens should be denied information on which to base their decisions.   It is their right and responsibility to determine the credibility of opinion polls.   The media is also likely to check and question the credibility of opinion polls, particularly as many will have been commissioned by rivals.  Citizens should be respected as thinking individuals.</p>

<p>Second, even though the opposition hopes that the natural process of credibility will check this possibility, it cannot be denied that manipulation can occur to the unaware voter. So due to this vulnerability of inaccurate information being disseminated, it is better to acknowledge the problems which occur in mediated messages which are often the primary source of information for voters.   This does not deny that polls can be accurate and are constantly being improved; however, the on-going nature of that science is different than the question at hand as to whether they can always be trusted as a form of information for those respected citizens.</p>

In the 1981 French Presidential election once the seven day ban started Chirac’s campaign suggested that their campaign was taking off and he would go through to the second round – which would make it two conservatives in the run off.
